# poetic_texts

Use literary, poetic and philosophical works as source data and run the data through machines learning process(Char-RNN) to generate new texts.
Users can trigger random vocabulary(from generated text) through the change of their geolocations.(ideally , whenever you move, the text will change)
 Subjectivity,agency & change, Sense of precariousness.
Source data: Proust, Joyce, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche…poetic works…etc.
Interface/Categories :
I am _______(agency, subjectivity, identity)
I love______(value, sth you care)
I want______(desire, need, force)

Concepts:
* Changes in geolocation can cause changes in text: words give action meaning, action also gives meaning to words.
* broken language/unsharable experience(what you are , what you want and what you love)
* Irony: share the unsharable , speak the unspeakable with works express the idea of “meaning” processed by machine/algrarism ——A new “meaning” could possibly created/generated?
*  Subjectivity, change, Sense of precariousness.
