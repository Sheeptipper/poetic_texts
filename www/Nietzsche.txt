WHATEVER MAY BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS QUESTIONABLE BOOK, IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN EXCEPTIONALLY SIGNIFICANT AND FASCINATING QUESTION, AND DEEPLY PERSONAL AT THAT: THE TIME IN WHICH IT WAS WRITTEN, IN SPITE OF WHICH IT WAS WRITTEN, BEARS WITNESS TO THAT‚ÄÎTHE EXCITING TIME OF THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR OF 1870/71. AS THE THUNDER OF THE BATTLE OF W√∂RTH WAS ROLLING OVER EUROPE, THE MUSER AND RIDDLEFRIEND WHO WAS TO BE THE FATHER OF THIS BOOK SAT SOMEWHERE IN AN ALPINE NOOK, VERY BEMUSED AND BERIDDLED, HENCE VERY CONCERNED AND YET UNCONCERNED, AND WROTE DOWN HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT THE GREEKS‚ÄÎTHE CORE OF THE STRANGE AND ALMOST INACCESSIBLE BOOK TO WHICH THIS BELATED PREFACE (OR POSTSCRIPT) SHALL NOW BE ADDED. A FEW WEEKS LATER‚ÄÎAND HE HIMSELF WAS TO BE FOUND UNDER THE WALLS OF METZ, STILL WEDDED TO THE QUESTION MARKS THAT HE HAD PLACED AFTER THE ALLEGED ‚ÄÚCHEERFULNESS‚ÄÙ OF THE GREEKS AND OF GREEK ART. EVENTUALLY, IN THAT MONTH OF PROFOUNDEST SUSPENSE WHEN THE PEACE TREATY WAS BEING DEBATED AT VERSAILLES, HE, TOO, ATTAINED PEACE WITH HIMSELF AND, SLOWLY CONVALESCING FROM AN ILLNESS CONTRACTED AT THE FRONT, COMPLETED THE FINAL DRAFT OF THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY OUT OF THE SPIRIT OF MUSIC.‚ÄÎOUT OF MUSIC? MUSIC AND TRAGEDY? GREEKS AND THE MUSIC OF TRAGEDY? GREEKS AND THE ART FORM OF PESSIMISM? THE BEST TURNED OUT, MOST BEAUTIFUL, MOST ENVIED TYPE OF HUMANITY TO DATE, THOSE MOST APT TO SEDUCE US TO LIFE, THE GREEKS‚ÄÎHOW NOW? THEY OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE NEEDED TRAGEDY? EVEN MORE‚ÄÎART? FOR WHAT‚ÄÎGREEK ART?YOU WILL GUESS WHERE THE BIG QUESTION MARK CONCERNING THE VALUE OF EXISTENCE HAD THUS BEEN RAISED. IS PESSIMISM NECESSARILY A SIGN OF DECLINE, DECAY, DEGENERATION, WEARY AND WEAK INSTINCTS‚ÄÎAS IT ONCE WAS IN INDIA AND NOW IS, TO ALL APPEARANCES, AMONG US, ‚ÄÚMODERN‚ÄÙ MEN AND EUROPEANS? IS THERE A PESSIMISM OF STRENGTH? AN INTELLECTUAL PREDILECTION FOR THE HARD, GRUESOME, EVIL, PROBLEMATIC ASPECT OF EXISTENCE, PROMPTED BY WELL-BEING, BY OVERFLOWING HEALTH, BY THE FULLNESS OF EXISTENCE? IS IT PERHAPS POSSIBLE TO SUFFER PRECISELY FROM OVERFULLNESS? THE SHARP-EYED COURAGE THAT TEMPTS AND ATTEMPTS, THAT CRAVES THE FRIGHTFUL AS THE ENEMY, THE WORTHY ENEMY, AGAINST WHOM ONE CAN TEST ONE‚ÄÔS STRENGTH? FROM WHOM ONE CAN LEARN WHAT IT MEANS ‚ÄÚTO BE FRIGHTENED‚ÄÙ? WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TRAGIC MYTH AMONG THE GREEKS OF THE BEST, THE STRONGEST, THE MOST COURAGEOUS PERIOD? AND THE TREMENDOUS PHENOMENON OF THE DIONYSIAN‚ÄÎAND, BORN FROM IT, TRAGEDY‚ÄÎWHAT MIGHT THEY SIGNIFY?‚ÄÎ AND AGAIN: THAT OF WHICH TRAGEDY DIED, THE SOCRATISM OF MORALITY, THE DIALECTICS, FRUGALITY, AND CHEERFULNESS OF THE THEORETICAL MAN‚ÄÎHOW NOW? MIGHT NOT THIS VERY SOCRATISM BE A SIGN OF DECLINE, OF WEARINESS, OF INFECTION, OF THE ANARCHICAL DISSOLUTION OF THE INSTINCTS? AND THE ‚ÄÚGREEK CHEERFULNESS‚ÄÙ OF THE LATER GREEKS‚ÄÎMERELY THE AFTERGLOW OF THE SUNSET? THE EPICUREANS‚ÄÔ RESOLVE AGAINST PESSIMISM‚ÄÎA MERE PRECAUTION OF THE AFFLICTED? AND SCIENCE ITSELF, OUR SCIENCE‚ÄÎINDEED, WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ALL SCIENCE, VIEWED AS A SYMPTOM OF LIFE? FOR WHAT‚ÄÎWORSE YET, WHENCE‚ÄÎALL SCIENCE? HOW NOW? IS THE RESOLVE TO BE SO SCIENTIFIC ABOUT EVERYTHING PERHAPS A KIND OF FEAR OF, AN ESCAPE FROM, PESSIMISM? A SUBTLE LAST RESORT AGAINST‚ÄÎTRUTH? AND, MORALLY SPEAKING, A SORT OF COWARDICE AND FALSENESS? AMORALLY SPEAKING, A RUSE? O SOCRATES, SOCRATES, WAS THAT PERHAPS YOUR SECRET? O ENIGMATIC IRONIST, WAS THAT PERHAPS YOUR‚ÄÎIRONY?WHAT I THEN GOT HOLD OF, SOMETHING FRIGHTFUL AND DANGEROUS, A PROBLEM WITH HORNS BUT NOT NECESSARILY A BULL, IN ANY CASE A NEW PROBLEM‚ÄÎTODAY I SHOULD SAY THAT IT WAS THE PROBLEM OF SCIENCE ITSELF, SCIENCE CONSIDERED FOR THE FIRST TIME AS PROBLEMATIC, AS QUESTIONABLE. BUT THE BOOK IN WHICH MY YOUTHFUL COURAGE AND SUSPICION FOUND AN OUTLET‚ÄÎWHAT AN IMPOSSIBLE BOOK HAD TO RESULT FROM A TASK SO UNCONGENIAL TO YOUTH! CONSTRUCTED FROM A LOT OF IMMATURE, OVERGREEN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES, ALL OF THEM CLOSE TO THE LIMITS OF COMMUNICATION, PRESENTED IN THE CONTEXT OF ART‚ÄÎFOR THE PROBLEM OF SCIENCE CANNOT BE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONTEXT OF SCIENCE‚ÄÎA BOOK PERHAPS FOR ARTISTS WHO ALSO HAVE AN ANALYTIC AND RETROSPECTIVE PENCHANT (IN OTHER WORDS, AN EXCEPTIONAL TYPE OF ARTIST FOR WHOM ONE MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK FAR AND WIDE AND REALLY WOULD NOT CARE TO LOOK); A BOOK FULL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS AND ARTISTS‚ÄÔ SECRETS, WITH AN ARTISTS‚ÄÔ METAPHYSICS IN THE BACKGROUND; A YOUTHFUL WORK FULL OF THE INTREPID MOOD OF YOUTH, THE MOODINESS OF YOUTH, INDEPENDENT, DEFIANTLY SELF-RELIANT EVEN WHERE IT SEEMS TO BOW BEFORE AN AUTHORITY AND PERSONAL REVERENCE; IN SUM, A FIRST BOOK, ALSO IN EVERY BAD SENSE OF THAT LABEL. IN SPITE OF THE PROBLEM WHICH SEEMS CONGENIAL TO OLD AGE, THE BOOK IS MARKED BY EVERY DEFECT OF YOUTH, WITH ITS ‚ÄÚLENGTH IN EXCESS‚ÄÙ AND ITS ‚ÄÚSTORM AND STRESS.‚ÄÙ ON THE OTHER HAND, CONSIDERING ITS SUCCESS (ESPECIALLY WITH THE GREAT ARTIST TO WHOM IT ADDRESSED ITSELF AS IN A DIALOGUE, RICHARD WAGNER), IT IS A PROVEN BOOK, I MEAN ONE THAT IN ANY CASE SATISFIED ‚ÄÚTHE BEST MINDS OF THE TIME.‚ÄÙ1 IN VIEW OF THAT, IT REALLY OUGHT TO BE TREATED WITH SOME CONSIDERATION AND TACITURNITY. STILL, I DO NOT WANT TO SUPPRESS ENTIRELY HOW DISAGREEABLE IT NOW SEEMS TO ME, HOW STRANGE IT APPEARS NOW, AFTER SIXTEEN YEARS‚ÄÎBEFORE A MUCH OLDER, A HUNDRED TIMES MORE DEMANDING, BUT BY NO MEANS COLDER EYE WHICH HAS NOT BECOME A STRANGER TO THE TASK WHICH THIS AUDACIOUS BOOK DARED TO TACKLE FOR THE FIRST TIME: TO LOOK AT SCIENCE IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ARTIST, BUT AT ART IN THAT OF LIFE.TO SAY IT ONCE MORE: TODAY I FIND IT AN IMPOSSIBLE BOOK: I CONSIDER IT BADLY WRITTEN, PONDEROUS, EMBARRASSING, IMAGE-MAD AND IMAGE-CONFUSED, SENTIMENTAL, IN PLACES SACCHARINE TO THE POINT OF EFFEMINACY, UNEVEN IN TEMPO, WITHOUT THE WILL TO LOGICAL CLEANLINESS, VERY CONVINCED AND THEREFORE DISDAINFUL OF PROOF, MISTRUSTFUL EVEN OF THE PROPRIETY OF PROOF, A BOOK FOR INITIATES, ‚ÄÚMUSIC‚ÄÙ FOR THOSE DEDICATED TO MUSIC, THOSE WHO ARE CLOSELY RELATED TO BEGIN WITH ON THE BASIS OF COMMON AND RARE AESTHETIC EXPERIENCES, ‚ÄÚMUSIC‚ÄÙ MEANT AS A SIGN OF RECOGNITION FOR CLOSE RELATIVES IN ARTIBUS2‚ÄÎAN ARROGANT AND RHAPSODIC BOOK THAT SOUGHT TO EXCLUDE RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING THE PROFANUM VULGUS3 OF ‚ÄÚTHE EDUCATED‚ÄÙ EVEN MORE THAN ‚ÄÚTHE MASS‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚFOLK.‚ÄÙ STILL, THE EFFECT OF THE BOOK PROVED AND PROVES THAT IT HAD A KNACK FOR SEEKING OUT FELLOW-RHAPSODIZERS AND FOR LURING THEM ON TO NEW SECRET PATHS AND DANCING PLACES. WHAT FOUND EXPRESSION HERE WAS ANYWAY‚ÄÎTHIS WAS ADMITTED WITH AS MUCH CURIOSITY AS ANTIPATHY‚ÄÎA STRANGE VOICE, THE DISCIPLE OF A STILL ‚ÄÚUNKNOWN GOD,‚ÄÙ ONE WHO CONCEALED HIMSELF FOR THE TIME BEING UNDER THE SCHOLAR‚ÄÔS HOOD, UNDER THE GRAVITY AND DIALECTICAL ILL HUMOR OF THE GERMAN, EVEN UNDER THE BAD MANNERS OF THE WAGNERIAN. HERE WAS A SPIRIT WITH STRANGE, STILL NAMELESS NEEDS, A MEMORY BURSTING WITH QUESTIONS, EXPERIENCES, CONCEALED THINGS AFTER WHICH THE NAME OF DIONYSUS WAS ADDED AS ONE MORE QUESTION MARK. WHAT SPOKE HERE‚ÄÎAS WAS ADMITTED, NOT WITHOUT SUSPICION‚ÄÎWAS SOMETHING LIKE A MYSTICAL, ALMOST MAENADIC SOUL THAT STAMMERED WITH DIFFICULTY, A FEAT OF THE WILL, AS IN A STRANGE TONGUE, ALMOST UNDECIDED WHETHER IT SHOULD COMMUNICATE OR CONCEAL ITSELF. IT SHOULD HAVE SUNG, THIS ‚ÄÚNEW SOUL‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND NOT SPOKEN!WHAT I HAD TO SAY THEN‚ÄÎTOO BAD THAT I DID NOT DARE SAY IT AS A POET: PERHAPS I HAD THE ABILITY. OR AT LEAST AS A PHILOLOGIST: AFTER ALL, EVEN TODAY PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING IN THIS FIELD REMAINS TO BE DISCOVERED AND DUG UP BY PHILOLOGISTS! ABOVE ALL, THE PROBLEM THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM HERE‚ÄÎAND THAT THE GREEKS, AS LONG AS WE LACK AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION ‚ÄÚWHAT IS DIONYSIAN?‚ÄÙ REMAIN AS TOTALLY UNCOMPREHENDED AND UNIMAGINABLE AS EVER.
INDEED, WHAT IS DIONYSIAN?‚ÄÎTHIS BOOK CONTAINS AN ANSWER: ONE ‚ÄÚWHO KNOWS‚ÄÙ IS TALKING, THE INITIATE AND DISCIPLE OF HIS GOD. NOW I SHOULD PERHAPS SPEAK MORE CAUTIOUSLY AND LESS ELOQUENTLY ABOUT SUCH A DIFFICULT PSYCHOLOGICAL QUESTION AS THAT CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF TRAGEDY AMONG THE GREEKS. THE QUESTION OF THE GREEK‚ÄÔS RELATION TO PAIN, HIS DEGREE OF SENSITIVITY, IS BASIC: DID THIS RELATION REMAIN CONSTANT? OR DID IT CHANGE RADICALLY? THE QUESTION IS WHETHER HIS EVER STRONGER CRAVING FOR BEAUTY, FOR FESTIVALS, PLEASURES, NEW CULTS WAS ROOTED IN SOME DEFICIENCY, PRIVATION, MELANCHOLY, PAIN? SUPPOSING THAT THIS WERE TRUE‚ÄÎAND PERICLES (OR THUCYDIDES) SUGGESTS AS MUCH IN THE GREAT FUNERAL ORATION‚ÄÎHOW SHOULD WE THEN HAVE TO EXPLAIN THE ORIGIN OF THE OPPOSITE CRAVING, WHICH DEVELOPED EARLIER IN TIME, THE CRAVING FOR THE UGLY; THE GOOD, SEVERE WILL OF THE OLDER GREEKS TO PESSIMISM, TO THE TRAGIC MYTH, TO THE IMAGE OF EVERYTHING UNDERLYING EXISTENCE THAT IS FRIGHTFUL, EVIL, A RIDDLE, DESTRUCTIVE, FATAL? WHAT, THEN, WOULD BE THE ORIGIN OF TRAGEDY? PERHAPS JOY, STRENGTH, OVERFLOWING HEALTH, OVERGREAT FULLNESS? AND WHAT, THEN, IS THE SIGNIFICANCE, PHYSIOLOGICALLY SPEAKING, OF THAT MADNESS OUT OF WHICH TRAGIC AND COMIC ART DEVELOPED‚ÄÎTHE DIONYSIAN MADNESS? HOW NOW? IS MADNESS PERHAPS NOT NECESSARILY THE SYMPTOM OF DEGENERATION, DECLINE, AND THE FINAL STAGE OF CULTURE? ARE THERE PERHAPS‚ÄÎA QUESTION FOR PSYCHIATRISTS‚ÄÎNEUROSES OF HEALTH? OF THE YOUTH AND YOUTHFULNESS OF A PEOPLE? WHERE DOES THAT SYNTHESIS OF GOD AND BILLY GOAT IN THE SATYR POINT? WHAT EXPERIENCE OF HIMSELF, WHAT URGE COMPELLED THE GREEK TO CONCEIVE THE DIONYSIAN ENTHUSIAST AND PRIMEVAL MAN AS A SATYR? AND REGARDING THE ORIGIN OF THE TRAGIC CHORUS: DID THOSE CENTURIES WHEN THE GREEK BODY FLOURISHED AND THE GREEK SOUL FOAMED OVER WITH HEALTH PERHAPS KNOW ENDEMIC ECSTASIES? VISIONS AND HALLUCINATIONS SHARED BY ENTIRE COMMUNITIES OR ASSEMBLIES AT A CULT? HOW NOW? SHOULD THE GREEKS, PRECISELY IN THE ABUNDANCE OF THEIR YOUTH, HAVE HAD THE WILL TO THE TRAGIC AND HAVE BEEN PESSIMISTS? SHOULD IT HAVE BEEN MADNESS, TO USE ONE OF PLATO‚ÄÔS PHRASES, THAT BROUGHT THE GREATEST BLESSINGS UPON GREECE? ON THE OTHER HAND, CONVERSELY, COULD IT BE THAT THE GREEKS BECAME MORE AND MORE OPTIMISTIC, SUPERFICIAL, AND HISTRIONIC PRECISELY IN THE PERIOD OF DISSOLUTION AND WEAKNESS‚ÄÎMORE AND MORE ARDENT FOR LOGIC AND LOGICIZING THE WORLD AND THUS MORE ‚ÄÚCHEERFUL‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚSCIENTIFIC‚ÄÙ? HOW NOW? COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT, IN SPITE OF ALL ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS‚ÄÙ AND THE PREJUDICES OF A DEMOCRATIC TASTE, THE TRIUMPH OF OPTIMISM, THE GRADUAL PREVALENCE OF RATIONALITY, PRACTICAL AND THEORETICAL UTILITARIANISM, NO LESS THAN DEMOCRACY ITSELF WHICH DEVELOPED AT THE SAME TIME, MIGHT ALL HAVE BEEN SYMPTOMS OF A DECLINE OF STRENGTH, OF IMPENDING OLD AGE, AND OF PHYSIOLOGICAL WEARINESS? THESE, AND NOT PESSIMISM? WAS EPICURUS AN OPTIMIST‚ÄÎPRECISELY BECAUSE HE WAS AFFLICTED?IT IS APPARENT THAT IT WAS A WHOLE CLUSTER OF GRAVE QUESTIONS WITH WHICH THIS BOOK BURDENED ITSELF. LET US ADD THE GRAVEST QUESTION OF ALL. WHAT, SEEN IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF LIFE, IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MORALITY?ALREADY IN THE PREFACE ADDRESSED TO RICHARD WAGNER, ART, AND NOT MORALITY, IS PRESENTED AS THE TRULY METAPHYSICAL ACTIVITY OF MAN. IN THE BOOK ITSELF THE SUGGESTIVE SENTENCE IS REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES, THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE WORLD IS JUSTIFIED ONLY AS AN AESTHETIC PHENOMENON. INDEED, THE WHOLE BOOK KNOWS ONLY AN ARTISTIC MEANING AND CRYPTO-MEANING BEHIND ALL EVENTS‚ÄÎA ‚ÄÚGOD,‚ÄÙ IF YOU PLEASE, BUT CERTAINLY ONLY AN ENTIRELY RECKLESS AND AMORAL ARTIST-GOD WHO WANTS TO EXPERIENCE, WHETHER HE IS BUILDING OR DESTROYING, IN THE GOOD AND IN THE BAD, HIS OWN JOY AND GLORY‚ÄÎONE WHO, CREATING WORLDS, FREES HIMSELF FROM THE DISTRESS OF FULLNESS AND OVERFULLNESS AND FROM THE AFFLICTION OF THE CONTRADICTIONS COMPRESSED IN HIS SOUL.6 THE WORLD‚ÄÎAT EVERY MOMENT THE ATTAINED SALVATION OF GOD, AS THE ETERNALLY CHANGING, ETERNALLY NEW VISION OF THE MOST DEEPLY AFFLICTED, DISCORDANT, AND CONTRADICTORY BEING WHO CAN FIND SALVATION ONLY IN APPEARANCE: YOU CAN CALL THIS WHOLE ARTISTS‚ÄÔ METAPHYSICS ARBITRARY, IDLE, FANTASTIC; WHAT MATTERS IS THAT IT BETRAYS A SPIRIT WHO WILL ONE DAY FIGHT AT ANY RISK WHATEVER THE MORAL INTERPRETATION AND SIGNIFICANCE OF EXISTENCE. HERE, PERHAPS FOR THE FIRST TIME, A PESSIMISM ‚ÄÚBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL‚ÄÙ7 IS SUGGESTED. HERE THAT ‚ÄÚPERVERSITY OF MIND‚ÄÙ GAINS SPEECH AND FORMULATION AGAINST WHICH SCHOPENHAUER NEVER WEARIED OF HURLING IN ADVANCE HIS MOST IRATE CURSES AND THUNDERBOLTS: A PHILOSOPHY THAT DARES TO MOVE, TO DEMOTE, MORALITY INTO THE REALM OF APPEARANCE‚ÄÎAND NOT MERELY AMONG ‚ÄÚAPPEARANCES‚ÄÙ OR PHENOMENA (IN THE SENSE ASSIGNED TO THESE WORDS BY IDEALISTIC PHILOSOPHERS), BUT AMONG ‚ÄÚDECEPTIONS,‚ÄÙ AS SEMBLANCE, DELUSION, ERROR, INTERPRETATION, CONTRIVANCE, ART.PERHAPS THE DEPTH OF THIS ANTIMORAL PROPENSITY IS BEST INFERRED FROM THE CAREFUL AND HOSTILE SILENCE WITH WHICH CHRISTIANITY IS TREATED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BOOK‚ÄÎCHRISTIANITY AS THE MOST PRODIGAL ELABORATION OF THE MORAL THEME TO WHICH HUMANITY HAS EVER BEEN SUBJECTED. IN TRUTH, NOTHING COULD BE MORE OPPOSED TO THE PURELY AESTHETIC INTERPRETATION AND JUSTIFICATION OF THE WORLD WHICH ARE TAUGHT IN THIS BOOK THAN THE CHRISTIAN TEACHING, WHICH IS, AND WANTS TO BE, ONLY MORAL AND WHICH RELEGATES ART, EVERY ART, TO THE REALM OF LIES; WITH ITS ABSOLUTE STANDARDS, BEGINNING WITH THE TRUTHFULNESS OF GOD, IT NEGATES, JUDGES, AND DAMNS ART. BEHIND THIS MODE OF THOUGHT AND VALUATION, WHICH MUST BE HOSTILE TO ART IF IT IS AT ALL GENUINE, I NEVER FAILED TO SENSE A HOSTILITY TO LIFE‚ÄÎA FURIOUS, VENGEFUL ANTIPATHY TO LIFE ITSELF: FOR ALL OF LIFE IS BASED ON SEMBLANCE, ART, DECEPTION, POINTS OF VIEW, AND THE NECESSITY OF PERSPECTIVES AND ERROR. CHRISTIANITY WAS FROM THE BEGINNING, ESSENTIALLY AND FUNDAMENTALLY, LIFE‚ÄÔS NAUSEA AND DISGUST WITH LIFE, MERELY CONCEALED BEHIND, MASKED BY, DRESSED UP AS, FAITH IN ‚ÄÚANOTHER‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚBETTER‚ÄÙ LIFE. HATRED OF ‚ÄÚTHE WORLD,‚ÄÙ CONDEMNATIONS OF THE PASSIONS, FEAR OF BEAUTY AND SENSUALITY, A BEYOND INVENTED THE BETTER TO SLANDER THIS LIFE, AT BOTTOM A CRAVING FOR THE NOTHING, FOR THE END, FOR RESPITE, FOR ‚ÄÚTHE SABBATH OF SABBATHS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎALL THIS ALWAYS STRUCK ME, NO LESS THAN THE UNCONDITIONAL WILL OF CHRISTIANITY TO RECOGNIZE ONLY MORAL VALUES, AS THE MOST DANGEROUS AND UNCANNY FORM OF ALL POSSIBLE FORMS OF A ‚ÄÚWILL TO DECLINE‚ÄÙ8‚ÄÎAT THE VERY LEAST A SIGN OF ABYSMAL SICKNESS, WEARINESS, DISCOURAGEMENT, EXHAUSTION, AND THE IMPOVERISHMENT OF LIFE. FOR, CONFRONTED WITH MORALITY (ESPECIALLY CHRISTIAN, OR UNCONDITIONAL, MORALITY), LIFE MUST CONTINUALLY AND INEVITABLY BE IN THE WRONG, BECAUSE LIFE IS SOMETHING ESSENTIALLY AMORAL‚ÄÎAND EVENTUALLY, CRUSHED BY THE WEIGHT OF CONTEMPT AND THE ETERNAL NO, LIFE MUST THEN BE FELT TO BE UNWORTHY OF DESIRE AND ALTOGETHER WORTHLESS. MORALITY ITSELF‚ÄÎHOW NOW? MIGHT NOT MORALITY BE ‚ÄÚA WILL TO NEGATE LIFE,‚ÄÙ A SECRET INSTINCT OF ANNIHILATION, A PRINCIPLE OF DECAY, DIMINUTION, AND SLANDER‚ÄÎTHE BEGINNING OF THE END? HENCE, THE DANGER OF DANGERS?IT WAS AGAINST MORALITY THAT MY INSTINCT TURNED WITH THIS QUESTIONABLE BOOK, LONG AGO; IT WAS AN INSTINCT THAT ALIGNED ITSELF WITH LIFE AND THAT DISCOVERED, FOR ITSELF A FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSITE DOCTRINE AND VALUATION OF LIFE‚ÄÎPURELY ARTISTIC AND ANTI-CHRISTIAN. WHAT TO CALL IT? AS A PHILOLOGIST AND MAN OF WORDS I BAPTIZED IT, NOT WITHOUT TAKING SOME LIBERTY‚ÄÎFOR WHO COULD CLAIM TO KNOW THE RIGHTFUL NAME OF THE ANTICHRIST?‚ÄÎIN THE NAME OF A GREEK GOD: I CALLED IT DIONYSIAN.IT IS CLEAR WHAT TASK I FIRST DARED TO TOUCH WITH THIS BOOK? HOW I REGRET NOW THAT IN THOSE DAYS I STILL LACKED THE COURAGE (OR IMMODESTY?) TO PERMIT MYSELF IN EVERY WAY AN INDIVIDUAL LANGUAGE OF MY OWN FOR SUCH INDIVIDUAL VIEWS AND HAZARDS‚ÄÎAND THAT INSTEAD I TRIED LABORIOUSLY TO EXPRESS BY MEANS OF SCHOPENHAUERIAN AND KANTIAN FORMULAS STRANGE AND NEW VALUATIONS WHICH WERE BASICALLY AT ODDS WITH KANT‚ÄÔS AND SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS SPIRIT AND TASTE! WHAT, AFTER ALL, DID SCHOPENHAUER THINK OF TRAGEDY?‚ÄÚTHAT WHICH BESTOWS ON EVERYTHING TRAGIC ITS PECULIAR ELEVATING FORCE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHE SAYS IN THE WORLD AS WILL AND REPRESENTATION,9 VOLUME II‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚIS THE DISCOVERY THAT THE WORLD, THAT LIFE, CAN NEVER GIVE REAL SATISFACTION AND HENCE IS NOT WORTHY OF OUR AFFECTION: THIS CONSTITUTES THE TRAGIC SPIRIT‚ÄÎIT LEADS TO RESIGNATION.‚ÄÙHOW DIFFERENTLY DIONYSUS SPOKE TO ME! HOW FAR REMOVED I WAS FROM ALL THIS RESIGNATIONISM!‚ÄÎ10 BUT THERE IS SOMETHING FAR WORSE IN THIS BOOK, SOMETHING I NOW REGRET STILL MORE THAN THAT I OBSCURED AND SPOILED DIONYSIAN PREMONITIONS WITH SCHOPENHAUERIAN FORMULATIONS: NAMELY, THAT I SPOILED THE GRANDIOSE GREEK PROBLEM, AS IT HAD ARISEN BEFORE MY EYES, BY INTRODUCING THE MOST MODERN PROBLEMS! THAT I APPENDED HOPES WHERE THERE WAS NO GROUND FOR HOPE, WHERE EVERYTHING POINTED ALL TOO PLAINLY TO AN END! THAT ON THE BASIS OF THE LATEST GERMAN MUSIC I BEGAN TO RAVE ABOUT ‚ÄÚTHE GERMAN SPIRIT‚ÄÙ AS IF THAT WERE IN THE PROCESS EVEN THEN OF DISCOVERING AND FINDING ITSELF AGAIN‚ÄÎAT A TIME WHEN THE GERMAN SPIRIT, WHICH NOT LONG BEFORE HAD STILL HAD THE WILL TO DOMINATE EUROPE AND THE STRENGTH TO LEAD EUROPE,11 WAS JUST MAKING ITS TESTAMENT AND ABDICATING FOREVER, MAKING ITS TRANSITION, UNDER THE POMPOUS PRETENSE OF FOUNDING A REICH, TO A LEVELING MEDIOCRITY, DEMOCRACY, AND ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS‚ÄÙ!INDEED, MEANWHILE I HAVE LEARNED TO CONSIDER THIS ‚ÄÚGERMAN SPIRIT‚ÄÙ WITH A SUFFICIENT LACK OF HOPE OR MERCY; ALSO, CONTEMPORARY GERMAN MUSIC, WHICH IS ROMANTICISM THROUGH AND THROUGH AND MOST UN-GREEK OF ALL POSSIBLE ART FORMS‚ÄÎMOREOVER, A FIRST-RATE POISON FOR THE NERVES, DOUBLY DANGEROUS AMONG A PEOPLE WHO LOVE DRINK AND WHO HONOR LACK OF CLARITY AS A VIRTUE, FOR IT HAS THE DOUBLE QUALITY OF A NARCOTIC THAT BOTH INTOXICATES AND SPREADS A FOG.TO BE SURE, APART FROM ALL THE HASTY HOPES AND FAULTY APPLICATIONS TO THE PRESENT WITH WHICH I SPOILED MY FIRST BOOK, THERE STILL REMAINS THE GREAT DIONYSIAN QUESTION MARK I RAISED‚ÄÎREGARDING MUSIC AS WELL: WHAT WOULD A MUSIC HAVE TO BE LIKE THAT WOULD NO LONGER BE OF ROMANTIC ORIGIN, LIKE GERMAN MUSIC‚ÄÎBUT DIONYSIAN?BUT, MY DEAR SIR, WHAT IN THE WORLD IS ROMANTIC IF YOUR BOOK ISN‚ÄÔT? CAN DEEP HATRED AGAINST ‚ÄÚTHE NOW,‚ÄÙ AGAINST ‚ÄÚREALITY‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS‚ÄÙ BE PUSHED FURTHER THAN YOU PUSHED IT IN YOUR ARTISTS‚ÄÔ METAPHYSICS? BELIEVING SOONER IN THE NOTHING, SOONER IN THE DEVIL THAN IN ‚ÄÚTHE NOW‚ÄÙ? IS IT NOT A DEEP BASS OF WRATH AND THE LUST FOR DESTRUCTION THAT WE HEAR HUMMING UNDERNEATH ALL OF YOUR CONTRAPUNTAL VOCAL ART AND SEDUCTION OF THE EAR, A FURIOUS RESOLVE AGAINST EVERYTHING THAT IS ‚ÄÚNOW,‚ÄÙ A WILL THAT IS NOT TOO FAR REMOVED FROM PRACTICAL NIHILISM AND SEEMS TO SAY: ‚ÄÚSOONER LET NOTHING BE TRUE THAN THAT YOU SHOULD BE RIGHT, THAN THAT YOUR TRUTH SHOULD BE PROVED RIGHT!‚ÄÙLISTEN YOURSELF, MY DEAR PESSIMIST AND ART-DEIFIER, BUT WITH OPEN EARS, TO A SINGLE PASSAGE CHOSEN FROM YOUR BOOK‚ÄÎTO THE NOT INELOQUENT DRAGON-SLAYER PASSAGE WHICH MAY HAVE AN INSIDIOUS PIED-PIPER SOUND FOR YOUNG EARS AND HEARTS. HOW NOW? ISN‚ÄÔT THIS THE TYPICAL CREED OF THE ROMANTIC OF 1830, MASKED BY THE PESSIMISM OF 1850? EVEN THE USUAL ROMANTIC FINALE IS SOUNDED‚ÄÎBREAK, BREAKDOWN, RETURN AND COLLAPSE BEFORE AN OLD FAITH, BEFORE THE OLD GOD. HOW NOW? IS YOUR PESSIMISTS‚ÄÔ BOOK NOT ITSELF A PIECE OF ANTI-HELLENISM AND ROMANTICISM? IS IT NOT ITSELF SOMETHING ‚ÄÚEQUALLY INTOXICATING AND BEFOGGING,‚ÄÙ IN ANY CASE A NARCOTIC, EVEN A PIECE OF MUSIC, GERMAN MUSIC? BUT LISTEN:‚ÄÚLET US IMAGINE A COMING GENERATION WITH SUCH INTREPIDITY OF VISION, WITH SUCH A HEROIC PENCHANT FOR THE TREMENDOUS; LET US IMAGINE THE BOLD STRIDE OF THESE DRAGON-SLAYERS, THE PROUD AUDACITY WITH WHICH THEY TURN THEIR BACK ON ALL THE WEAKLING‚ÄÔS DOCTRINES OF OPTIMISM IN ORDER TO ‚ÄÒLIVE RESOLUTELY‚ÄÔ IN WHOLENESS AND FULLNESS: WOULD IT NOT BE NECESSARY FOR THE TRAGIC MAN OF SUCH A CULTURE, IN VIEW OF HIS SELF-EDUCATION FOR SERIOUSNESS AND TERROR, TO DESIRE A NEW ART, THE ART OF METAPHYSICAL COMFORT, TO DESIRE TRAGEDY AS HIS OWN PROPER HELEN, AND TO EXCLAIM WITH FAUST:SHOULD NOT MY LONGING OVERLEAP THE DISTANCEAND DRAW THE FAIREST FORM INTO EXISTENCE?‚ÄÙ‚ÄÚWOULD IT NOT BE NECESSARY?‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎNO, THRICE NO! O YOU YOUNG ROMANTICS: IT WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY! BUT IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT IT WILL END THAT WAY, THAT YOU END THAT WAY‚ÄÎNAMELY, ‚ÄÚCOMFORTED,‚ÄÙ AS IT IS WRITTEN, IN SPITE OF ALL SELF-EDUCATION FOR SERIOUSNESS AND TERROR, ‚ÄÚCOMFORTED METAPHYSICALLY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎIN SUM, AS ROMANTICS END, AS CHRISTIANS.NO! YOU OUGHT TO LEARN THE ART OF THIS-WORLDLY COMFORT FIRST; YOU OUGHT TO LEARN TO LAUGH, MY YOUNG FRIENDS, IF YOU ARE HELL-BENT ON REMAINING PESSIMISTS. THEN PERHAPS, AS LAUGHERS, YOU MAY SOME DAY DISPATCH ALL METAPHYSICAL COMFORTS TO THE DEVIL‚ÄÎMETAPHYSICS IN FRONT. OR, TO SAY IT IN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT DIONYSIAN MONSTER WHO BEARS THE NAME OF ZARATHUSTRA:‚ÄÚRAISE UP YOUR HEARTS, MY BROTHERS, HIGH, HIGHER! AND DON‚ÄÔT FORGET YOUR LEGS! RAISE UP YOUR LEGS, TOO, GOOD DANCERS; AND STILL BETTER: STAND ON YOUR HEADS!‚ÄÚTHIS CROWN OF THE LAUGHER, THE ROSE-WREATH CROWN: I CROWN MYSELF WITH THIS CROWN; I MYSELF PRONOUNCED HOLY MY LAUGHTER. I DID NOT FIND ANYONE ELSE TODAY STRONG ENOUGH FOR THAT.‚ÄÚZARATHUSTRA, THE DANCER; ZARATHUSTRA, THE LIGHT ONE WHO BECKONS WITH HIS WINGS, PREPARING FOR A FLIGHT, BECKONING TO ALL BIRDS, READY AND HEADY, BLISSFULLY LIGHTHEADED;‚ÄÚZARATHUSTRA, THE SOOTHSAYER; ZARATHUSTRA, THE SOOTH-LAUGHER; NOT IMPATIENT; NOT UNCONDITIONAL; ONE WHO LOVES LEAPS AND SIDE-LEAPS: I CROWN MYSELF WITH THIS CROWN.‚ÄÚTHIS CROWN OF THE LAUGHER, THE ROSE-WREATH CROWN: TO YOU, MY BROTHERS, I THROW THIS CROWN.

IN THE FIRST EDITION OF 1872 THE TITLE WAS THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY OUT OF THE SPIRIT OF MUSIC. A SECOND EDITION WITH VERY SLIGHT TEXTUAL CHANGES WAS PRINTED IN 1874 AND APPEARED IN 1878. IN 1886, THE SAME YEAR THAT SAW THE PUBLICATION OF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, THE REMAINING COPIES OF BOTH EDITIONS WERE REISSUED WITH THE NEW TITLE PAGE, ABOVE.

HE ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED THE TERM TO SYMBOLIZE THE TENDENCIES THAT FOUND EXPRESSION IN THE FESTIVALS OF DIONYSUS, AND CONTRASTED THE DIONYSIAN WITH THE APOLLINIAN; BUT IN HIS LATER THOUGHT THE DIONYSIAN STANDS FOR THE CREATIVE EMPLOYMENT OF THE PASSIONS AND THE AFFIRMATION OF LIFE IN SPITE OF SUFFERING‚ÄÎAS IT WERE, FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF THE DIONYSIAN, AS ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED, WITH THE APOLLINIAN‚ÄÎAND IT IS CONTRASTED WITH THE CHRISTIAN NEGATION OF LIFE AND EXTIRPATION OF THE PASSIONS. IN THE TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS, WRITTEN IN 1888, THE OUTLOOK OF THE OLD GOETHE CAN THUS BE CALLED DIONYSIAN (SECTION 49).THE WORDS WHICH HEINE, IN HIS SCH√∂PFUNGSLIEDER, ATTRIBUTES TO GOD: ‚ÄÚDISEASE WAS THE MOST BASIC GROUND/OF MY CREATIVE URGE AND STRESS;/CREATING, I COULD CONVALESCE,/CREATING, I AGAIN GREW SOUND.‚ÄÙTHE BOOK WITH THAT TITLE WAS PUBLISHED IN 1886, THE SAME YEAR THAT THE NEW EDITION OF THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY APPEARED, WITH THIS PREFACE.UNTERGANG, AS IN THE TITLE OF SPENGLER‚ÄÔS DECLINE OF THE WEST, WHICH WAS INFLUENCED DECISIVELY BY THIS DISCUSSION.

THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY.OUT OF THE SPIRIT OF MUSIC.PREFACE TO RICHARD WAGNER.TO KEEP AT A DISTANCE ALL THE POSSIBLE SCRUPLES, EXCITEMENTS, AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS THAT THE THOUGHTS UNITED IN THIS ESSAY WILL OCCASION, IN VIEW OF THE PECULIAR CHARACTER OF OUR AESTHETIC PUBLIC, AND TO BE ABLE TO WRITE THESE INTRODUCTORY REMARKS, TOO, WITH THE SAME CONTEMPLATIVE DELIGHT WHOSE REFLECTION‚ÄÎTHE DISTILLATION OF GOOD AND ELEVATING HOURS‚ÄÎIS EVIDENT ON EVERY PAGE, I PICTURE THE MOMENT WHEN YOU, MY HIGHLY RESPECTED FRIEND, WILL RECEIVE THIS ESSAY. PERHAPS AFTER AN EVENING WALK IN THE WINTER SNOW, YOU WILL BEHOLD PROMETHEUS UNBOUND ON THE TITLE PAGE, READ MY NAME, AND BE CONVINCED AT ONCE THAT, WHATEVER THIS ESSAY SHOULD CONTAIN, THE AUTHOR CERTAINLY HAS SOMETHING SERIOUS AND URGENT TO SAY; ALSO THAT, AS HE HATCHED THESE IDEAS, HE WAS COMMUNICATING WITH YOU AS IF YOU WERE PRESENT, AND HENCE COULD WRITE DOWN ONLY WHAT WAS IN KEEPING WITH THAT PRESENCE. YOU WILL RECALL THAT IT WAS DURING THE SAME PERIOD WHEN YOUR SPLENDID FESTSCHRIFT ON BEETHOVEN CAME INTO BEING, AMID THE TERRORS AND SUBLIMITIES OF THE WAR THAT HAD JUST BROKEN OUT, THAT I COLLECTED MYSELF FOR THESE REFLECTIONS. YET ANYONE WOULD BE MISTAKEN IF HE ASSOCIATED MY REFLECTIONS WITH THE CONTRAST BETWEEN PATRIOTIC EXCITEMENT AND AESTHETIC ENTHUSIASM, OF COURAGEOUS SERIOUSNESS AND A CHEERFUL GAME: IF HE REALLY READ THIS ESSAY, IT WOULD DAWN ON HIM, TO HIS SURPRISE, WHAT A SERIOUSLY GERMAN PROBLEM IS FACED HERE AND PLACED RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF GERMAN HOPES, AS A VORTEX AND TURNING POINT.1 BUT PERHAPS SUCH READERS WILL FIND IT OFFENSIVE THAT AN AESTHETIC PROBLEM SHOULD BE TAKEN SO SERIOUSLY‚ÄÎASSUMING THEY ARE UNABLE TO CONSIDER ART MORE THAN A PLEASANT SIDELINE, A READILY DISPENSABLE TINKLING OF BELLS THAT ACCOMPANIES THE ‚ÄÚSERIOUSNESS OF LIFE,‚ÄÙ JUST AS IF NOBODY KNEW WHAT WAS INVOLVED IN SUCH A CONTRAST WITH THE ‚ÄÚSERIOUSNESS OF LIFE.‚ÄÙ LET SUCH ‚ÄÚSERIOUS‚ÄÙ READERS LEARN SOMETHING FROM THE FACT THAT I AM CONVINCED THAT ART REPRESENTS THE HIGHEST TASK AND THE TRULY METAPHYSICAL ACTIVITY OF THIS LIFE, IN THE SENSE OF THAT MAN TO WHOM, AS MY SUBLIME PREDECESSOR ON THIS PATH, I WISH TO DEDICATE THIS ESSAY.BASEL, END OF THE YEAR 1871.WE SHALL HAVE GAINED MUCH FOR THE SCIENCE OF AESTHETICS, ONCE WE PERCEIVE NOT MERELY BY LOGICAL INFERENCE, BUT WITH THE IMMEDIATE CERTAINTY OF VISION, THAT THE CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT OF ART IS BOUND UP WITH THE APOLLINIAN AND DIONYSIAN DUALITY‚ÄÎJUST AS PROCREATION DEPENDS ON THE DUALITY OF THE SEXES, INVOLVING PERPETUAL STRIFE WITH ONLY PERIODICALLY INTERVENING RECONCILIATIONS. THE TERMS DIONYSIAN AND APOLLINIAN WE BORROW FROM THE GREEKS, WHO DISCLOSE TO THE DISCERNING MIND THE PROFOUND MYSTERIES OF THEIR VIEW OF ART, NOT, TO BE SURE, IN CONCEPTS, BUT IN THE INTENSELY CLEAR FIGURES OF THEIR GODS. THROUGH APOLLO AND DIONYSUS, THE TWO ART DEITIES OF THE GREEKS, WE COME TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN THE GREEK WORLD THERE EXISTED A TREMENDOUS OPPOSITION, IN ORIGIN AND AIMS,1 BETWEEN THE APOLLINIAN ART OF SCULPTURE, AND THE NONIMAGISTIC, DIONYSIAN ART OF MUSIC. THESE TWO DIFFERENT TENDENCIES RUN PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER, FOR THE MOST PART OPENLY AT VARIANCE; AND THEY CONTINUALLY INCITE EACH OTHER TO NEW AND MORE POWERFUL BIRTHS, WHICH PERPETUATE AN ANTAGONISM, ONLY SUPERFICIALLY RECONCILED BY THE COMMON TERM ‚ÄÚART;‚ÄÙ TILL EVENTUALLY,2 BY A METAPHYSICAL MIRACLE OF THE HELLENIC ‚ÄÚWILL,‚ÄÙ THEY APPEAR COUPLED WITH EACH OTHER, AND THROUGH THIS COUPLING ULTIMATELY GENERATE AN EQUALLY DIONYSIAN AND APOLLINIAN FORM OF ART‚ÄÎATTIC TRAGEDY.IN ORDER TO GRASP THESE TWO TENDENCIES, LET US FIRST CONCEIVE OF THEM AS THE SEPARATE ART WORLDS OF DREAMS AND INTOXICATION. THESE PHYSIOLOGICAL PHENOMENA PRESENT A CONTRAST ANALOGOUS TO THAT EXISTING BETWEEN THE APOLLINIAN AND THE DIONYSIAN. IT WAS IN DREAMS, SAYS LUCRETIUS, THAT THE GLORIOUS DIVINE FIGURES FIRST APPEARED TO THE SOULS OF MEN; IN DREAMS THE GREAT SHAPER BEHELD THE SPLENDID BODIES OF SUPERHUMAN BEINGS; AND THE HELLENIC POET, IF QUESTIONED ABOUT THE MYSTERIES OF POETIC INSPIRATION, WOULD LIKEWISE HAVE SUGGESTED DREAMS AND HE MIGHT HAVE GIVEN AN EXPLANATION LIKE THAT OF HANS SACHS IN THE MEISTERSINGER:THE POET‚ÄÔS TASK IS THIS, MY FRIEND,TO READ HIS DREAMS AND COMPREHEND.THE TRUEST HUMAN FANCY SEEMS TO BE REVEALED TO US IN DREAMS:
ALL POEMS AND VERSIFICATION ARE BUT TRUE DREAMS‚ÄÔ INTERPRETATION.THE BEAUTIFUL ILLUSION4 OF THE DREAM WORLDS, IN THE CREATION OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS TRULY AN ARTIST, IS THE PREREQUISITE OF ALL PLASTIC ART, AND, AS WE SHALL SEE, OF AN IMPORTANT PART OF POETRY ALSO. IN OUR DREAMS WE DELIGHT IN THE IMMEDIATE UNDERSTANDING OF FIGURES; ALL FORMS SPEAK TO US; THERE IS NOTHING UNIMPORTANT OR SUPERFLUOUS. BUT EVEN WHEN THIS DREAM REALITY IS MOST INTENSE, WE STILL HAVE, GLIMMERING THROUGH IT, THE SENSATION THAT IT IS MERE APPEARANCE: AT LEAST THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE, AND FOR ITS FREQUENCY‚ÄÎINDEED, NORMALITY‚ÄÎI COULD ADDUCE MANY PROOFS, INCLUDING THE SAYINGS OF THE POETS.PHILOSOPHICAL MEN EVEN HAVE A PRESENTIMENT THAT THE REALITY IN WHICH WE LIVE AND HAVE OUR BEING IS ALSO MERE APPEARANCE, AND THAT ANOTHER, QUITE DIFFERENT REALITY LIES BENEATH IT. SCHOPENHAUER ACTUALLY INDICATES AS THE CRITERION OF PHILOSOPHICAL ABILITY THE OCCASIONAL ABILITY TO VIEW MEN AND THINGS AS MERE PHANTOMS OR DREAM IMAGES. THUS THE AESTHETICALLY SENSITIVE MAN STANDS IN THE SAME RELATION TO THE REALITY OF DREAMS AS THE PHILOSOPHER DOES TO THE REALITY OF EXISTENCE; HE IS A CLOSE AND WILLING OBSERVER, FOR THESE IMAGES AFFORD HIM AN INTERPRETATION OF LIFE, AND BY REFLECTING ON THESE PROCESSES HE TRAINS HIMSELF FOR LIFE.IT IS NOT ONLY THE AGREEABLE AND FRIENDLY IMAGES THAT HE EXPERIENCES AS SOMETHING UNIVERSALLY INTELLIGIBLE: THE SERIOUS, THE TROUBLED, THE SAD, THE GLOOMY, THE SUDDEN RESTRAINTS, THE TRICKS OF ACCIDENT, ANXIOUS EXPECTATIONS, IN SHORT, THE WHOLE DIVINE COMEDY OF LIFE, INCLUDING THE INFERNO, ALSO PASS BEFORE HIM, NOT LIKE MERE SHADOWS ON A WALL‚ÄÎFOR HE LIVES AND SUFFERS WITH THESE SCENES‚ÄÎAND YET NOT WITHOUT THAT FLEETING SENSATION OF ILLUSION. AND PERHAPS MANY WILL, LIKE MYSELF, RECALL HOW AMID THE DANGERS AND TERRORS OF DREAMS THEY HAVE OCCASIONALLY SAID TO THEMSELVES IN SELF-ENCOURAGEMENT, AND NOT WITHOUT SUCCESS: ‚ÄÚIT IS A DREAM! I WILL DREAM ON!‚ÄÙ I HAVE LIKEWISE HEARD OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE ONE AND THE SAME DREAM FOR THREE AND EVEN MORE SUCCESSIVE NIGHTS‚ÄÎFACTS WHICH INDICATE CLEARLY HOW OUR INNERMOST BEING, OUR COMMON GROUND, EXPERIENCES DREAMS WITH PROFOUND DELIGHT AND A JOYOUS NECESSITY.THIS JOYOUS NECESSITY OF THE DREAM EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN EMBODIED BY THE GREEKS IN THEIR APOLLO: APOLLO, THE GOD OF ALL PLASTIC ENERGIES, IS AT THE SAME TIME THE SOOTHSAYING GOD. HE, WHO (AS THE ETYMOLOGY OF THE NAME INDICATES) IS THE ‚ÄÚSHINING ONE,‚ÄÙ5 THE DEITY OF LIGHT, IS ALSO RULER OVER THE BEAUTIFUL ILLUSION OF THE INNER WORLD OF FANTASY. THE HIGHER TRUTH, THE PERFECTION OF THESE STATES IN CONTRAST TO THE INCOMPLETELY INTELLIGIBLE EVERYDAY WORLD, THIS DEEP CONSCIOUSNESS OF NATURE, HEALING AND HELPING IN SLEEP AND DREAMS, IS AT THE SAME TIME THE SYMBOLICAL ANALOGUE OF THE SOOTHSAYING FACULTY AND OF THE ARTS GENERALLY, WHICH MAKE LIFE POSSIBLE AND WORTH LIVING. BUT WE MUST ALSO INCLUDE IN OUR IMAGE OF APOLLO THAT DELICATE BOUNDARY WHICH THE DREAM IMAGE MUST NOT OVERSTEP LEST IT HAVE A PATHOLOGICAL EFFECT (IN WHICH CASE MERE APPEARANCE WOULD DECEIVE US AS IF IT WERE CRUDE REALITY). WE MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT MEASURED RESTRAINT, THAT FREEDOM FROM THE WILDER EMOTIONS, THAT CALM OF THE SCULPTOR GOD. HIS EYE MUST BE ‚ÄÚSUNLIKE,‚ÄÙ AS BEFITS HIS ORIGIN; EVEN WHEN IT IS ANGRY AND DISTEMPERED IT IS STILL HALLOWED BY BEAUTIFUL ILLUSION. AND SO, IN ONE SENSE, WE MIGHT APPLY TO APOLLO THE WORDS OF SCHOPENHAUER WHEN HE SPEAKS OF THE MAN WRAPPED IN THE VEIL OF MƑÅYƑÅ6 (WELT ALS WILLE UND VORSTELLUNG, I7): ‚ÄÚJUST AS IN A STORMY SEA THAT, UNBOUNDED IN ALL DIRECTIONS, RAISES AND DROPS MOUNTAINOUS WAVES, HOWLING, A SAILOR SITS IN A BOAT AND TRUSTS IN HIS FRAIL BARK: SO IN THE MIDST OF A WORLD OF TORMENTS THE INDIVIDUAL HUMAN BEING SITS QUIETLY, SUPPORTED BY AND TRUSTING IN THE PRINCIPIUM INDIVIDUATIONIS.‚ÄÙ8 IN FACT, WE MIGHT SAY OF APOLLO THAT IN HIM THE UNSHAKEN FAITH IN THIS PRINCIPIUM AND THE CALM REPOSE OF THE MAN WRAPPED UP IN IT RECEIVE THEIR MOST SUBLIME EXPRESSION; AND WE MIGHT CALL APOLLO HIMSELF THE GLORIOUS DIVINE IMAGE OF THE PRINCIPIUM INDIVIDUATIONIS, THROUGH WHOSE GESTURES AND EYES ALL THE JOY AND WISDOM OF ‚ÄÚILLUSION,‚ÄÙ TOGETHER WITH ITS BEAUTY, SPEAK TO US.IN THE SAME WORK SCHOPENHAUER HAS DEPICTED FOR US THE TREMENDOUS TERROR WHICH SEIZES MAN WHEN HE IS SUDDENLY DUMFOUNDED BY THE COGNITIVE FORM OF PHENOMENA BECAUSE THE PRINCIPLE OF SUFFICIENT REASON, IN SOME ONE OF ITS MANIFESTATIONS, SEEMS TO SUFFER AN EXCEPTION. IF WE ADD TO THIS TERROR THE BLISSFUL ECSTASY THAT WELLS FROM THE INNERMOST DEPTHS OF MAN, INDEED OF NATURE, AT THIS COLLAPSE OF THE PRINCIPIUM INDIVIDUATIONIS, WE STEAL A GLIMPSE INTO THE NATURE OF THE DIONYSIAN, WHICH IS BROUGHT HOME TO US MOST INTIMATELY BY THE ANALOGY OF INTOXICATION.EITHER UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE NARCOTIC DRAUGHT, OF WHICH THE SONGS OF ALL PRIMITIVE MEN AND PEOPLES SPEAK, OR WITH THE POTENT COMING OF SPRING THAT PENETRATES ALL NATURE WITH JOY, THESE DIONYSIAN EMOTIONS AWAKE, AND AS THEY GROW IN INTENSITY EVERYTHING SUBJECTIVE VANISHES INTO COMPLETE SELF-FORGETFULNESS. IN THE GERMAN MIDDLE AGES, TOO, SINGING AND DANCING CROWDS, EVER INCREASING IN NUMBER, WHIRLED THEMSELVES FROM PLACE TO PLACE UNDER THIS SAME DIONYSIAN IMPULSE. IN THESE DANCERS OF ST. JOHN AND ST. VITUS, WE REDISCOVER THE BACCHIC CHORUSES OF THE GREEKS, WITH THEIR PREHISTORY IN ASIA MINOR, AS FAR BACK AS BABYLON AND THE ORGIASTIC SACAEA.9 THERE ARE SOME WHO, FROM OBTUSENESS OR LACK OF EXPERIENCE, TURN AWAY FROM SUCH PHENOMENA AS FROM ‚ÄÚFOLK-DISEASES,‚ÄÙ WITH CONTEMPT OR PITY BORN OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THEIR OWN ‚ÄÚHEALTHY-MINDEDNESS.‚ÄÙ BUT OF COURSE SUCH POOR WRETCHES HAVE NO IDEA HOW CORPSELIKE AND GHOSTLY THEIR SO-CALLED ‚ÄÚHEALTHY-MINDEDNESS‚ÄÙ LOOKS WHEN THE GLOWING LIFE OF THE DIONYSIAN REVELERS ROARS PAST THEM.UNDER THE CHARM OF THE DIONYSIAN NOT ONLY IS THE UNION BETWEEN MAN AND MAN REAFFIRMED, BUT NATURE WHICH HAS BECOME ALIENATED, HOSTILE, OR SUBJUGATED, CELEBRATES ONCE MORE HER RECONCILIATION WITH HER LOST SON,10 MAN. FREELY, EARTH PROFFERS HER GIFTS, AND PEACEFULLY THE BEASTS OF PREY OF THE ROCKS AND DESERT APPROACH. THE CHARIOT OF DIONYSUS IS COVERED WITH FLOWERS AND GARLANDS; PANTHERS AND TIGERS WALK UNDER ITS YOKE. TRANSFORM BEETHOVEN‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚHYMN TO JOY‚ÄÙ INTO A PAINTING; LET YOUR IMAGINATION CONCEIVE THE MULTITUDES BOWING TO THE DUST, AWESTRUCK‚ÄÎTHEN YOU WILL APPROACH THE DIONYSIAN. NOW THE SLAVE IS A FREE MAN; NOW ALL THE RIGID, HOSTILE BARRIERS THAT NECESSITY, CAPRICE, OR ‚ÄÚIMPUDENT CONVENTION‚ÄÙ11 HAVE FIXED BETWEEN MAN AND MAN ARE BROKEN. NOW, WITH THE GOSPEL OF UNIVERSAL HARMONY, EACH ONE FEELS HIMSELF NOT ONLY UNITED, RECONCILED, AND FUSED WITH HIS NEIGHBOR, BUT AS ONE WITH HIM, AS IF THE VEIL OF MƑÅYƑÅ HAD BEEN TORN ASIDE AND WERE NOW MERELY FLUTTERING IN TATTERS BEFORE THE MYSTERIOUS PRIMORDIAL UNITY.IN SONG AND IN DANCE MAN EXPRESSES HIMSELF AS A MEMBER OF A HIGHER COMMUNITY; HE HAS FORGOTTEN HOW TO WALK AND SPEAK AND IS ON THE WAY TOWARD FLYING INTO THE AIR, DANCING. HIS VERY GESTURES EXPRESS ENCHANTMENT. JUST AS THE ANIMALS NOW TALK, AND THE EARTH YIELDS MILK AND HONEY, SUPERNATURAL SOUNDS EMANATE FROM HIM, TOO: HE FEELS HIMSELF A GOD, HE HIMSELF NOW WALKS ABOUT ENCHANTED, IN ECSTASY, LIKE THE GODS HE SAW WALKING IN HIS DREAMS. HE IS NO LONGER AN ARTIST, HE HAS BECOME A WORK OF ART: IN THESE PAROXYSMS OF INTOXICATION THE ARTISTIC POWER OF ALL NATURE REVEALS ITSELF TO THE HIGHEST GRATIFICATION OF THE PRIMORDIAL UNITY. THE NOBLEST CLAY, THE MOST COSTLY MARBLE, MAN, IS HERE KNEADED AND CUT, AND TO THE SOUND OF THE CHISEL STROKES OF THE DIONYSIAN WORLD-ARTIST RINGS OUT THE CRY OF THE ELEUSINIAN MYSTERIES: ‚ÄÚDO YOU PROSTRATE YOURSELVES, MILLIONS? DO YOU SENSE YOUR MAKER, WORLD?‚ÄÙTHUS FAR WE HAVE CONSIDERED THE APOLLINIAN AND ITS OPPOSITE, THE DIONYSIAN, AS ARTISTIC ENERGIES WHICH BURST FORTH FROM NATURE HERSELF, WITHOUT THE MEDIATION OF THE HUMAN ARTIST‚ÄÎENERGIES IN WHICH NATURE‚ÄÔS ART IMPULSES ARE SATISFIED IN THE MOST IMMEDIATE AND DIRECT WAY‚ÄÎFIRST IN THE IMAGE WORLD OF DREAMS, WHOSE COMPLETENESS IS NOT DEPENDENT UPON THE INTELLECTUAL ATTITUDE OR THE ARTISTIC CULTURE OF ANY SINGLE BEING; AND THEN AS INTOXICATED REALITY, WHICH LIKEWISE DOES NOT HEED THE SINGLE UNIT, BUT EVEN SEEKS TO DESTROY THE INDIVIDUAL AND REDEEM HIM BY A MYSTIC FEELING OF ONENESS. WITH REFERENCE TO THESE IMMEDIATE ART-STATES OF NATURE, EVERY ARTIST IS AN ‚ÄÚIMITATOR,‚ÄÙ THAT IS TO SAY, EITHER AN APOLLINIAN ARTIST IN DREAMS, OR A DIONYSIAN ARTIST IN ECSTASIES, OR FINALLY‚ÄÎAS FOR EXAMPLE IN GREEK TRAGEDY‚ÄÎAT ONCE ARTIST IN BOTH DREAMS AND ECSTASIES; SO WE MAY PERHAPS PICTURE HIM SINKING DOWN IN HIS DIONYSIAN INTOXICATION AND MYSTICAL SELF-ABNEGATION, ALONE AND APART FROM THE SINGING REVELERS, AND WE MAY IMAGINE HOW, THROUGH APOLLINIAN DREAM-INSPIRATION, HIS OWN STATE, I.E., HIS ONENESS WITH THE INMOST GROUND OF THE WORLD, IS REVEALED TO HIM IN A SYMBOLICAL DREAM IMAGE.SO MUCH FOR THESE GENERAL PREMISES AND CONTRASTS. LET US NOW APPROACH THE GREEKS IN ORDER TO LEARN HOW HIGHLY THESE ART IMPULSES OF NATURE WERE DEVELOPED IN THEM. THUS WE SHALL BE IN A POSITION TO UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE MORE DEEPLY THAT RELATION OF THE GREEK ARTIST TO HIS ARCHETYPES WHICH IS, ACCORDING TO THE ARISTOTELIAN EXPRESSION, ‚ÄÚTHE IMITATION OF NATURE.‚ÄÙ IN SPITE OF ALL THE DREAM LITERATURE AND THE NUMEROUS DREAM ANECDOTES OF THE GREEKS, WE CAN SPEAK OF THEIR DREAMS ONLY CONJECTURALLY, THOUGH WITH REASONABLE ASSURANCE. IF WE CONSIDER THE INCREDIBLY PRECISE AND UNERRING PLASTIC POWER OF THEIR EYES, TOGETHER WITH THEIR VIVID, FRANK DELIGHT IN COLORS, WE CAN HARDLY REFRAIN FROM ASSUMING EVEN FOR THEIR DREAMS (TO THE SHAME OF ALL THOSE BORN LATER) A CERTAIN LOGIC OF LINE AND CONTOUR, COLORS AND GROUPS, A CERTAIN PICTORIAL SEQUENCE REMINDING US OF THEIR FINEST BAS-RELIEFS WHOSE PERFECTION WOULD CERTAINLY JUSTIFY US, IF A COMPARISON WERE POSSIBLE, IN DESIGNATING THE DREAMING GREEKS AS HOMERS AND HOMER AS A DREAMING GREEK‚ÄÎIN A DEEPER SENSE THAN THAT IN WHICH MODERN MAN, SPEAKING OF HIS DREAMS, VENTURES TO COMPARE HIMSELF WITH SHAKESPEARE.ON THE OTHER HAND, WE NEED NOT CONJECTURE REGARDING THE IMMENSE GAP WHICH SEPARATES THE DIONYSIAN GREEK FROM THE DIONYSIAN BARBARIAN. FROM ALL QUARTERS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD‚ÄÎTO SAY NOTHING HERE OF THE MODERN‚ÄÎFROM ROME TO BABYLON, WE CAN POINT TO THE EXISTENCE OF DIONYSIAN FESTIVALS, TYPES WHICH BEAR, AT BEST, THE SAME RELATION TO THE GREEK FESTIVALS WHICH THE BEARDED SATYR, WHO BORROWED HIS NAME AND ATTRIBUTES FROM THE GOAT, BEARS TO DIONYSUS HIMSELF. IN NEARLY EVERY CASE THESE FESTIVALS CENTERED IN EXTRAVAGANT SEXUAL LICENTIOUSNESS, WHOSE WAVES OVERWHELMED ALL FAMILY LIFE AND ITS VENERABLE TRADITIONS; THE MOST SAVAGE NATURAL INSTINCTS WERE UNLEASHED, INCLUDING EVEN THAT HORRIBLE MIXTURE OF SENSUALITY AND CRUELTY WHICH HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME TO BE THE REAL ‚ÄÚWITCHES‚ÄÔ BREW.‚ÄÙ FOR SOME TIME, HOWEVER, THE GREEKS WERE APPARENTLY PERFECTLY INSULATED AND GUARDED AGAINST THE FEVERISH EXCITEMENTS OF THESE FESTIVALS, THOUGH KNOWLEDGE OF THEM MUST HAVE COME TO GREECE ON ALL THE ROUTES OF LAND AND SEA; FOR THE FIGURE OF APOLLO, RISING FULL OF PRIDE, HELD OUT THE GORGON‚ÄÔS HEAD TO THIS GROTESQUELY UNCOUTH DIONYSIAN POWER‚ÄÎAND REALLY COULD NOT HAVE COUNTERED ANY MORE DANGEROUS FORCE. IT IS IN DORIC ART THAT THIS MAJESTICALLY REJECTING ATTITUDE OF APOLLO IS IMMORTALIZED.THE OPPOSITION BETWEEN APOLLO AND DIONYSUS BECAME MORE HAZARDOUS AND EVEN IMPOSSIBLE, WHEN SIMILAR IMPULSES FINALLY BURST FORTH FROM THE DEEPEST ROOTS OF THE HELLENIC NATURE AND MADE A PATH FOR THEMSELVES: THE DELPHIC GOD, BY A SEASONABLY EFFECTED RECONCILIATION, NOW CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH TAKING THE DESTRUCTIVE WEAPONS FROM THE HANDS OF HIS POWERFUL ANTAGONIST. THIS RECONCILIATION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE GREEK CULT: WHEREVER WE TURN WE NOTE THE REVOLUTIONS RESULTING FROM THIS EVENT. THE TWO ANTAGONISTS WERE RECONCILED; THE BOUNDARY LINES TO BE OBSERVED HENCEFORTH BY EACH WERE SHARPLY DEFINED, AND THERE WAS TO BE A PERIODICAL EXCHANGE OF GIFTS OF ESTEEM. AT BOTTOM, HOWEVER, THE CHASM WAS NOT BRIDGED OVER. BUT IF WE OBSERVE HOW, UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THIS TREATY OF PEACE, THE DIONYSIAN POWER REVEALED ITSELF, WE SHALL NOW RECOGNIZE IN THE DIONYSIAN ORGIES OF THE GREEKS, AS COMPARED WITH THE BABYLONIAN SACAEA WITH THEIR REVERSION OF MAN TO THE TIGER AND THE APE, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FESTIVALS OF WORLD REDEMPTION AND DAYS OF TRANSFIGURATION. IT IS WITH THEM THAT NATURE FOR THE FIRST TIME ATTAINS HER ARTISTIC JUBILEE; IT IS WITH THEM THAT THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PRINCIPIUM INDIVIDUATIONIS FOR THE FIRST TIME BECOMES AN ARTISTIC PHENOMENON.THE HORRIBLE ‚ÄÚWITCHES‚ÄÔ BREW‚ÄÙ OF SENSUALITY AND CRUELTY BECOMES INEFFECTIVE; ONLY THE CURIOUS BLENDING AND DUALITY IN THE EMOTIONS OF THE DIONYSIAN REVELERS REMIND US‚ÄÎAS MEDICINES REMIND US OF DEADLY POISONS‚ÄÎOF THE PHENOMENON THAT PAIN BEGETS JOY, THAT ECSTASY MAY WRING SOUNDS OF AGONY FROM US. AT THE VERY CLIMAX OF JOY THERE SOUNDS A CRY OF HORROR OR A YEARNING LAMENTATION FOR AN IRRETRIEVABLE LOSS. IN THESE GREEK FESTIVALS, NATURE SEEMS TO REVEAL A SENTIMENTAL1 TRAIT; IT IS AS IF SHE WERE HEAVING A SIGH AT HER DISMENBERMENT INTO INDIVIDUALS. THE SONG AND PANTOMIME OF SUCH DUALLY-MINDED REVELERS WAS SOMETHING NEW AND UNHEARD-OF IN THE HOMERIC-GREEK WORLD; AND THE DIONYSIAN MUSIC IN PARTICULAR EXCITED AWE AND TERROR. IF MUSIC, AS IT WOULD SEEM, HAD BEEN KNOWN PREVIOUSLY AS AN APOLLINIAN ART, IT WAS SO, STRICTLY SPEAKING, ONLY AS THE WAVE BEAT OF RHYTHM, WHOSE FORMATIVE POWER WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE REPRESENTATION OF APOLLINIAN STATES. THE MUSIC OF APOLLO WAS DORIC ARCHITECTONICS IN TONES, BUT IN TONES THAT WERE MERELY SUGGESTIVE, SUCH AS THOSE OF THE CITHARA. THE VERY ELEMENT WHICH FORMS THE ESSENCE OF DIONYSIAN MUSIC (AND HENCE OF MUSIC IN GENERAL) IS CAREFULLY EXCLUDED AS UN-APOLLINIAN‚ÄÎNAMELY, THE EMOTIONAL POWER OF THE TONE, THE UNIFORM FLOW OF THE MELODY, AND THE UTTERLY INCOMPARABLE WORLD OF HARMONY. IN THE DIONYSIAN DITHYRAMB MAN IS INCITED TO THE GREATEST EXALTATION OF ALL HIS SYMBOLIC FACULTIES; SOMETHING NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED STRUGGLES FOR UTTERANCE‚ÄÎTHE ANNIHILATION OF THE VEIL OF MƑÅYƑÅ, ONENESS AS THE SOUL OF THE RACE AND OF NATURE ITSELF. THE ESSENCE OF NATURE IS NOW TO BE EXPRESSED SYMBOLICALLY; WE NEED A NEW WORLD OF SYMBOLS; AND THE ENTIRE SYMBOLISM OF THE BODY IS CALLED INTO PLAY, NOT THE MERE SYMBOLISM OF THE LIPS, FACE, AND SPEECH BUT THE WHOLE PANTOMIME OF DANCING, FORCING EVERY MEMBER INTO RHYTHMIC MOVEMENT. THEN THE OTHER SYMBOLIC POWERS SUDDENLY PRESS FORWARD, PARTICULARLY THOSE OF MUSIC, IN RHYTHMICS, DYNAMICS, AND HARMONY. TO GRASP THIS COLLECTIVE RELEASE OF ALL THE SYMBOLIC POWERS, MAN MUST HAVE ALREADY ATTAINED THAT HEIGHT OF SELF-ABNEGATION WHICH SEEKS TO EXPRESS ITSELF SYMBOLICALLY THROUGH ALL THESE POWERS‚ÄÎAND SO THE DITHYRAMBIC VOTARY OF DIONYSUS IS UNDERSTOOD ONLY BY HIS PEERS. WITH WHAT ASTONISHMENT MUST THE APOLLINIAN GREEK HAVE BEHELD HIM! WITH AN ASTONISHMENT THAT WAS ALL THE GREATER THE MORE IT WAS MINGLED WITH THE SHUDDERING SUSPICION THAT ALL THIS WAS ACTUALLY NOT SO VERY ALIEN TO HIM AFTER ALL, IN FACT, THAT IT WAS ONLY HIS APOLLINIAN CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH, LIKE A VEIL, HID THIS DIONYSIAN WORLD FROM HIS VISION.TO UNDERSTAND THIS, IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO LEVEL THE ARTISTIC STRUCTURE OF THE APOLLINIAN CULTURE, AS IT WERE, STONE BY STONE, TILL THE FOUNDATIONS ON WHICH IT RESTS BECOME VISIBLE. FIRST OF ALL WE SEE THE GLORIOUS OLYMPIAN FIGURES OF THE GODS, STANDING ON THE GABLES OF THIS STRUCTURE. THEIR DEEDS, PICTURED IN BRILLIANT RELIEFS, ADORN ITS FRIEZES. WE MUST NOT BE MISLED BY THE FACT THAT APOLLO STANDS SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE OTHERS AS AN INDIVIDUAL DEITY, WITHOUT ANY CLAIM TO PRIORITY OF RANK. FOR THE SAME IMPULSE THAT EMBODIED ITSELF IN APOLLO GAVE BIRTH TO THIS ENTIRE OLYMPIAN WORLD, AND IN THIS SENSE APOLLO IS ITS FATHER. WHAT TERRIFIC NEED WAS IT THAT COULD PRODUCE SUCH AN ILLUSTRIOUS COMPANY OF OLYMPIAN BEINGS?WHOEVER APPROACHES THESE OLYMPIANS WITH ANOTHER RELIGION IN HIS HEART, SEARCHING AMONG THEM FOR MORAL ELEVATION, EVEN FOR SANCTITY, FOR DISINCARNATE SPIRITUALITY, FOR CHARITY AND BENEVOLENCE, WILL SOON BE FORCED TO TURN HIS BACK ON THEM, DISCOURAGED AND DISAPPOINTED. FOR THERE IS NOTHING HERE THAT SUGGESTS ASCETICISM, SPIRITUALITY, OR DUTY. WE HEAR NOTHING BUT THE ACCENTS OF AN EXUBERANT, TRIUMPHANT LIFE IN WHICH ALL THINGS, WHETHER GOOD OR EVIL, ARE DEIFIED.1 AND SO THE SPECTATOR MAY STAND QUITE BEWILDERED BEFORE THIS FANTASTIC EXCESS OF LIFE, ASKING HIMSELF BY VIRTUE OF WHAT MAGIC POTION THESE HIGH-SPIRITED MEN COULD HAVE FOUND LIFE SO ENJOYABLE THAT, WHEREVER THEY TURNED, THEIR EYES BEHELD THE SMILE OF HELEN, THE IDEAL PICTURE OF THEIR OWN EXISTENCE, ‚ÄÚFLOATING IN SWEET SENSUALITY.‚ÄÙ BUT TO THIS SPECTATOR, WHO HAS ALREADY TURNED HIS BACK, WE MUST SAY: ‚ÄÚDO NOT GO AWAY, BUT STAY AND HEAR WHAT GREEK FOLK WISDOM HAS TO SAY OF THIS VERY LIFE, WHICH WITH SUCH INEXPLICABLE GAIETY UNFOLDS ITSELF BEFORE YOUR EYES.‚ÄÚTHERE IS AN ANCIENT STORY THAT KING MIDAS HUNTED IN THE FOREST A LONG TIME FOR THE WISE SILENUS, THE COMPANION OF DIONYSUS, WITHOUT CAPTURING HIM. WHEN SILENUS AT LAST FELL INTO HIS HANDS, THE KING ASKED WHAT WAS THE BEST AND MOST DESIRABLE OF ALL THINGS FOR MAN. FIXED AND IMMOVABLE, THE DEMIGOD SAID NOT A WORD, TILL AT LAST, URGED BY THE KING, HE GAVE A SHRILL LAUGH AND BROKE OUT INTO THESE WORDS: ‚ÄÒOH, WRETCHED EPHEMERAL RACE, CHILDREN OF CHANCE AND MISERY, WHY DO YOU COMPEL ME TO TELL YOU WHAT IT WOULD BE MOST EXPEDIENT FOR YOU NOT TO HEAR? WHAT IS BEST OF ALL IS UTTERLY BEYOND YOUR REACH: NOT TO BE BORN, NOT TO BE, TO BE NOTHING. BUT THE SECOND BEST FOR YOU IS‚ÄÎTO DIE SOON.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙHOW IS THE WORLD OF THE OLYMPIAN GODS RELATED TO THIS FOLK WISDOM? EVEN AS THE RAPTUROUS VISION OF THE TORTURED MARTYR TO HIS SUFFERING.NOW IT IS AS IF THE OLYMPIAN MAGIC MOUNTAIN3 HAD OPENED BEFORE US AND REVEALED ITS ROOTS TO US. THE GREEK KNEW AND FELT THE TERROR AND HORROR OF EXISTENCE. THAT HE MIGHT ENDURE THIS TERROR AT ALL, HE HAD TO INTERPOSE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND LIFE THE RADIANT DREAM-BIRTH OF THE OLYMPIANS. THAT OVERWHELMING DISMAY IN THE FACE OF THE TITANIC POWERS OF NATURE, THE MOIRA4 ENTHRONED INEXORABLY OVER ALL KNOWLEDGE, THE VULTURE OF THE GREAT LOVER OF MANKIND, PROMETHEUS, THE TERRIBLE FATE OF THE WISE OEDIPUS, THE FAMILY CURSE OF THE ATRIDAE WHICH DROVE ORESTES TO MATRICIDE: IN SHORT, THAT ENTIRE PHILOSOPHY OF THE SYLVAN GOD, WITH ITS MYTHICAL EXEMPLARS, WHICH CAUSED THE DOWNFALL OF THE MELANCHOLY ETRUSCANS‚ÄÎALL THIS WAS AGAIN AND AGAIN OVERCOME BY THE GREEKS WITH THE AID OF THE OLYMPIAN MIDDLE WORLD OF ART; OR AT ANY RATE IT WAS VEILED AND WITHDRAWN FROM SIGHT. IT WAS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO LIVE THAT THE GREEKS HAD TO CREATE THESE GODS FROM A MOST PROFOUND NEED. PERHAPS WE MAY PICTURE THE PROCESS TO OURSELVES SOMEWHAT AS FOLLOWS: OUT OF THE ORIGINAL TITANIC DIVINE ORDER OF TERROR, THE OLYMPIAN DIVINE ORDER OF JOY GRADUALLY EVOLVED THROUGH THE APOLLINIAN IMPULSE TOWARD BEAUTY, JUST AS ROSES BURST FROM THORNY BUSHES. HOW ELSE COULD THIS PEOPLE, SO SENSITIVE, SO VEHEMENT IN ITS DESIRES, SO SINGULARLY CAPABLE OF S√ΠFFERING, HAVE ENDURED EXISTENCE, IF IT HAD NOT BEEN REVEALED TO THEM IN THEIR GODS, SURROUNDED WITH A HIGHER GLORY?THE SAME IMPULSE WHICH CALLS ART INTO BEING, AS THE COMPLEMENT AND CONSUMMATION, OF EXISTENCE, SEDUCING ONE TO A CONTINUATION OF LIFE, WAS ALSO THE CAUSE OF THE OLYMPIAN WORLD WHICH THE HELLENIC ‚ÄÚWILL‚ÄÙ MADE USE OF AS A TRANSFIGURING MIRROR. THUS DO THE GODS JUSTIFY THE LIFE OF MAN: THEY THEMSELVES LIVE IT‚ÄÎTHE ONLY SATISFACTORY THEODICY! EXISTENCE UNDER THE BRIGHT SUNSHINE OF SUCH GODS IS REGARDED AS DESIRABLE IN ITSELF, AND THE REAL PAIN OF HOMERIC MEN IS CAUSED BY PARTING FROM IT, ESPECIALLY BY EARLY PARTING: SO THAT NOW, REVERSING THE WISDOM OF SILENUS, WE MIGHT SAY OF THE GREEKS THAT ‚ÄÚTO DIE SOON IS WORST OF ALL FOR THEM, THE NEXT WORST‚ÄÎTO DIE AT ALL.‚ÄÙ ONCE HEARD, IT WILL RING OUT AGAIN; DO NOT FORGET THE LAMENT OF THE SHORT-LIVED ACHILLES, MOURNING THE LEAFLIKE CHANGE AND VICISSITUDES OF THE RACE OF MEN AND THE DECLINE OF THE HEROIC AGE. IT IS NOT UNWORTHY OF THE GREATEST HERO TO LONG FOR A CONTINUATION OF LIFE, EVEN THOUGH HE LIVE AS A DAY LABORER.5 AT THE APOLLINIAN STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, THE ‚ÄÚWILL‚ÄÙ LONGS SO VEHEMENTLY FOR THIS EXISTENCE, THE HOMERIC MAN FEELS HIMSELF SO COMPLETELY AT ONE WITH IT, THAT LAMENTATION ITSELF BECOMES A SONG OF PRAISE.HERE WE SHOULD NOTE THAT THIS HARMONY WHICH IS CONTEMPLATED WITH SUCH LONGING BY MODERN MAN, IN FACT, THIS ONENESS OF MAN WITH NATURE (FOR WHICH SCHILLER INTRODUCED THE TECHNICAL TERM ‚ÄÚNA√ØVE‚ÄÙ), IS BY NO MEANS A SIMPLE CONDITION THAT COMES INTO BEING NATURALLY AND AS IF INEVITABLY. IT IS NOT A CONDITION THAT, LIKE A TERRESTRIAL PARADISE, MUST NECESSARILY BE FOUND AT THE GATE OF EVERY CULTURE. ONLY A ROMANTIC AGE COULD BELIEVE THIS, AN AGE WHICH CONCEIVED OF THE ARTIST IN TERMS OF ROUSSEAU‚ÄÔS EMILE AND IMAGINED THAT IN HOMER IT HAD FOUND SUCH AN ARTIST EMILE, REARED AT THE BOSOM OF NATURE. WHERE WE ENCOUNTER THE ‚ÄÚNA√ØVE‚ÄÙ IN ART, WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE HIGHEST EFFECT OF APOLLINIAN CULTURE‚ÄÎWHICH ALWAYS MUST FIRST OVERTHROW AN EMPIRE OF TITANS AND SLAY MONSTERS, AND WHICH MUST HAVE TRIUMPHED OVER AN ABYSMAL AND TERRIFYING VIEW OF THE WORLD AND THE KEENEST SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SUFFERING THROUGH RECOURSE TO THE MOST FORCEFUL AND PLEASURABLE ILLUSIONS. BUT HOW RARELY IS THE NA√ØVE ATTAINED‚ÄÎTHAT CONSUMMATE IMMERSION IN THE BEAUTY OF MERE APPEARANCE! HOW UNUTTERABLY SUBLIME IS HOMER THEREFORE, WHO, AS AN INDIVIDUAL BEING, BEARS THE SAME RELATION TO THIS APOLLINIAN FOLK CULTURE AS THE INDIVIDUAL DREAM ARTIST DOES TO THE DREAM FACULTY OF THE PEOPLE AND OF NATURE IN GENERAL.
THE HOMERIC ‚ÄÚNA√ØVET√©‚ÄÙ CAN BE UNDERSTOOD ONLY AS THE COMPLETE VICTORY OF APOLLINIAN ILLUSION: THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ILLUSIONS WHICH NATURE SO FREQUENTLY EMPLOYS TO ACHIEVE HER OWN ENDS. THE TRUE GOAL IS VEILED BY A PHANTASM: AND WHILE WE STRETCH OUT OUR HANDS FOR THE LATTER, NATURE ATTAINS THE FORMER BY MEANS OF OUR ILLUSION. IN THE GREEKS THE ‚ÄÚWILL‚ÄÙ WISHED TO CONTEMPLATE ITSELF IN THE TRANSFIGURATION OF GENIUS AND THE WORLD OF ART; IN ORDER TO GLORIFY THEMSELVES, ITS CREATURES HAD TO FEEL THEMSELVES WORTHY OF GLORY; THEY HAD TO BEHOLD THEMSELVES AGAIN IN A HIGHER SPHERE, WITHOUT THIS PERFECT WORLD OF CONTEMPLATION ACTING AS A COMMAND OR A REPROACH. THIS IS THE SPHERE OF BEAUTY, IN WHICH THEY SAW THEIR MIRROR IMAGES, THE OLYMPIANS. WITH THIS MIRRORING OF BEAUTY THE HELLENIC WILL COMBATED ITS ARTISTICALLY CORRELATIVE TALENT FOR SUFFERING AND FOR THE WISDOM OF SUFFERING‚ÄÎAND, AS A MONUMENT OF ITS VICTORY, WE HAVE HOMER, THE NA√ØVE ARTIST.NOW THE DREAM ANALOGY MAY THROW SOME LIGHT ON THE NA√ØVE ARTIST. LET US IMAGINE THE DREAMER: IN THE MIDST OF THE ILLUSION OF THE DREAM WORLD AND WITHOUT DISTURBING IT, HE CALLS OUT TO HIMSELF: ‚ÄÚIT IS A DREAM, I WILL DREAM ON.‚ÄÙ WHAT MUST WE INFER? THAT HE EXPERIENCES A DEEP INNER JOY IN DREAM CONTEMPLATION; ON THE OTHER HAND, TO BE AT ALL ABLE TO DREAM WITH THIS INNER JOY IN CONTEMPLATION, HE MUST HAVE COMPLETELY LOST SIGHT OF THE WAKING REALITY AND ITS OMINOUS OBTRUSIVENESS. GUIDED BY THE DREAM-READING APOLLO, WE MAY INTERPRET ALL THESE PHENOMENA IN ROUGHLY THIS WAY.
THOUGH IT IS CERTAIN THAT OF THE TWO HALVES OF OUR EXISTENCE, THE WAKING AND THE DREAMING STATES, THE FORMER APPEALS TO US AS INFINITELY PREFERABLE, MORE IMPORTANT, EXCELLENT, AND WORTHY OF BEING LIVED, INDEED, AS THAT WHICH ALONE IS LIVED‚ÄÎYET IN RELATION TO THAT MYSTERIOUS GROUND OF OUR BEING OF WHICH WE ARE THE PHENOMENA, I SHOULD, PARADOXICAL AS IT MAY SEEM, MAINTAIN THE VERY OPPOSITE ESTIMATE OF THE VALUE OF DREAMS. FOR THE MORE CLEARLY I PERCEIVE IN NATURE THOSE OMNIPOTENT ART IMPULSES, AND IN THEM AN ARDENT LONGING FOR ILLUSION, FOR REDEMPTION THROUGH ILLUSION, THE MORE I FEEL MYSELF IMPELLED TO THE METAPHYSICAL ASSUMPTION THAT THE TRULY EXISTENT PRIMAL UNITY, ETERNALLY SUFFERING AND CONTRADICTORY, ALSO NEEDS THE RAPTUROUS VISION, THE PLEASURABLE ILLUSION, FOR ITS CONTINUOUS REDEMPTION. AND WE, COMPLETELY WRAPPED UP IN THIS ILLUSION AND COMPOSED OF IT, ARE COMPELLED TO CONSIDER THIS ILLUSION AS THE TRULY NONEXISTENT‚ÄÎI.E., AS A PERPETUAL BECOMING IN TIME, SPACE, AND CAUSALITY‚ÄÎIN OTHER WORDS, AS EMPIRICAL REALITY. IF, FOR THE MOMENT, WE DO NOT CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF OUR OWN ‚ÄÚREALITY,‚ÄÙ IF WE CONCEIVE OF OUR EMPIRICAL EXISTENCE, AND OF THAT OF THE WORLD IN GENERAL, AS A CONTINUOUSLY MANIFESTED REPRESENTATION OF THE PRIMAL UNITY, WE SHALL THEN HAVE TO LOOK UPON THE DREAM AS A MERE APPEARANCE OF MERE APPEARANCE, HENCE AS A STILL HIGHER APPEASEMENT OF THE PRIMORDIAL DESIRE FOR MERE APPEARANCE. AND THAT IS WHY THE INNERMOST HEART OF NATURE FEELS THAT INEFFABLE JOY IN THE NA√ØVE ARTIST AND THE NA√ØVE WORK OF ART, WHICH IS LIKEWISE ONLY ‚ÄÚMERE APPEARANCE OF MERE APPEARANCE.‚ÄÙIN A SYMBOLIC PAINTING, RAPHAEL, HIMSELF ONE OF THESE IMMORTAL ‚ÄÚNA√ØVE‚ÄÙ ONES, HAS REPRESENTED FOR US THIS DEMOTION OF APPEARANCE TO THE LEVEL OF MERE APPEARANCE, THE PRIMITIVE PROCESS OF THE NA√ØVE ARTIST AND OF APOLLINIAN CULTURE. IN HIS TRANSFIGURATION, THE LOWER HALF OF THE PICTURE, WITH THE POSSESSED BOY, THE DESPAIRING BEARERS, THE BEWILDERED, TERRIFIED DISCIPLES, SHOWS US THE REFLECTION OF SUFFERING, PRIMAL AND ETERNAL, THE SOLE GROUND OF THE WORLD: THE ‚ÄÚMERE APPEARANCE‚ÄÙ HERE IS THE REFLECTION OF ETERNAL CONTRADICTION, THE FATHER OF THINGS. FROM THIS MERE APPEARANCE ARISES, LIKE AMBROSIAL VAPOR, A NEW VISIONARY WORLD OF MERE APPEARANCES, INVISIBLE TO THOSE WRAPPED IN THE FIRST APPEARANCE‚ÄÎA RADIANT FLOATING IN PUREST BLISS, A SERENE CONTEMPLATION BEAMING FROM WIDE-OPEN EYES. HERE WE HAVE PRESENTED, IN THE MOST SUBLIME ARTISTIC SYMBOLISM, THAT APOLLINIAN WORLD OF BEAUTY AND ITS SUBSTRATUM, THE TERRIBLE WISDOM OF SILENUS; AND INTUITIVELY WE COMPREHEND THEIR NECESSARY INTERDEPENDENCE. APOLLO, HOWEVER, AGAIN APPEARS TO US AS THE APOTHEOSIS OF THE PRINCIPIUM INDIVIDUATIONIS, IN WHICH ALONE IS CONSUMMATED THE PERPETUALLY ATTAINED GOAL OF THE PRIMAL UNITY, ITS REDEMPTION THROUGH MERE APPEARANCE. WITH HIS SUBLIME GESTURES, HE SHOWS US HOW NECESSARY IS THE ENTIRE WORLD OF SUFFERING, THAT BY MEANS OF IT THE INDIVIDUAL MAY BE IMPELLED TO REALIZE THE REDEEMING VISION, AND THEN, SUNK IN CONTEMPLATION OF IT, SIT QUIETLY IN HIS TOSSING BARK, AMID THE WAVES.IF WE CONCEIVE OF IT AT ALL AS IMPERATIVE AND MANDATORY, THIS APOTHEOSIS OF INDIVIDUATION KNOWS BUT ONE LAW‚ÄÎTHE INDIVIDUAL, I.E., THE DELIMITING OF THE BOUNDARIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL, MEASURE IN THE HELLENIC SENSE. APOLLO, AS ETHICAL DEITY, EXACTS MEASURE OF HIS DISCIPLES, AND, TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN IT, HE REQUIRES SELF-KNOWLEDGE. AND SO, SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE AESTHETIC NECESSITY FOR BEAUTY, THERE OCCUR THE DEMANDS ‚ÄÚKNOW THYSELF‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚNOTHING IN EXCESS;‚ÄÙ CONSEQUENTLY OVERWEENING PRIDE AND EXCESS ARE REGARDED AS THE TRULY HOSTILE DEMONS OF THE NON-APOLLINIAN SPHERE, HENCE AS CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PRE-APOLLINIAN AGE‚ÄÎTHAT OF THE TITANS; AND OF THE EXTRA-APOLLINIAN WORLD‚ÄÎTHAT OF THE BARBARIANS. BECAUSE OF HIS TITANIC LOVE FOR MAN, PROMETHEUS MUST BE TORN TO PIECES BY VULTURES; BECAUSE OF HIS EXCESSIVE WISDOM, WHICH COULD SOLVE THE RIDDLE OF THE SPHINX, OEDIPUS MUST BE PLUNGED INTO A BEWILDERING VORTEX OF CRIME. THUS DID THE DELPHIC GOD INTERPRET THE GREEK PAST.THE EFFECTS WROUGHT BY THE DIONYSIAN ALSO SEEMED ‚ÄÚTITANIC‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚBARBARIC‚ÄÙ TO THE APOLLINIAN GREEK; WHILE AT THE SAME TIME HE COULD NOT CONCEAL FROM HIMSELF THAT HE, TOO, WAS INWARDLY RELATED TO THESE OVERTHROWN TITANS AND HEROES. INDEED, HE HAD TO RECOGNIZE EVEN MORE THAN THIS: DESPITE ALL ITS BEAUTY AND MODERATION, HIS ENTIRE EXISTENCE RESTED ON A HIDDEN SUBSTRATUM OF SUFFERING AND OF KNOWLEDGE, REVEALED TO HIM BY THE DIONYSIAN. AND BEHOLD: APOLLO COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT DIONYSUS! THE ‚ÄÚTITANIC‚ÄÙ AND THE ‚ÄÚBARBARIC‚ÄÙ WERE IN THE LAST ANALYSIS AS NECESSARY AS THE APOLLINIAN.AND NOW LET US IMAGINE HOW INTO THIS WORLD, BUILT ON MERE APPEARANCE AND MODERATION AND ARTIFICIALLY DAMMED UP, THERE PENETRATED, IN TONES EVER MORE BEWITCHING AND ALLURING, THE ECSTATIC SOUND OF THE DIONYSIAN FESTIVAL; HOW IN THESE STRAINS ALL OF NATURE‚ÄÔS EXCESS IN PLEASURE, GRIEF, AND KNOWLEDGE BECAME AUDIBLE, EVEN IN PIERCING SHRIEKS; AND LET US ASK OURSELVES WHAT THE PSALMODIZING ARTIST OF APOLLO, WITH HIS PHANTOM HARP-SOUND, COULD MEAN IN THE FACE OF THIS DEMONIC FOLK-SONG! THE MUSES OF THE ARTS OF ‚ÄÚILLUSION‚ÄÙ PALED BEFORE AN ART THAT, IN ITS INTOXICATION, SPOKE THE TRUTH. THE WISDOM OF SILENUS CRIED ‚ÄÚWOE! WOE!‚ÄÙ TO THE SERENE OLYMPIANS. THE INDIVIDUAL, WITH ALL HIS RESTRAINT AND PROPORTION, SUCCUMBED TO THE SELF-OBLIVION OF THE DIONYSIAN STATES, FORGETTING THE PRECEPTS OF APOLLO. EXCESS REVEALED ITSELF AS TRUTH. CONTRADICTION, THE BLISS BORN OF PAIN, SPOKE OUT FROM THE VERY HEART OF NATURE. AND SO, WHEREVER THE DIONYSIAN PREVAILED, THE APOLLINIAN WAS CHECKED AND DESTROYED. BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS EQUALLY CERTAIN THAT, WHEREVER THE FIRST DIONYSIAN ONSLAUGHT WAS SUCCESSFULLY WITHSTOOD, THE AUTHORITY AND MAJESTY OF THE DELPHIC GOD EXHIBITED ITSELF AS MORE RIGID AND MENACING THAN EVER. FOR TO ME THE DORIC STATE1 AND DORIC ART ARE EXPLICABLE ONLY AS A PERMANENT MILITARY ENCAMPMENT OF THE APOLLINIAN. ONLY INCESSANT RESISTANCE TO THE TITANIC-BARBARIC NATURE OF THE DIONYSIAN COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE LONG SURVIVAL OF AN ART SO DEFIANTLY PRIM AND SO ENCOMPASSED WITH BULWARKS, A TRAINING SO WARLIKE AND RIGOROUS, AND A POLITICAL STRUCTURE SO CRUEL AND RELENTLESS.UP TO THIS POINT WE HAVE SIMPLY ENLARGED UPON THE OBSERVATION MADE AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS ESSAY: THAT THE DIONYSIAN AND THE APOLLINIAN, IN NEW BIRTHS EVER FOLLOWING AND MUTUALLY AUGMENTING ONE ANOTHER, CONTROLLED THE HELLENIC GENIUS; THAT OUT OF THE AGE OF ‚ÄÚBRONZE,‚ÄÙ WITH ITS WARS OF THE TITANS AND ITS RIGOROUS FOLK PHILOSOPHY, THE HOMERIC WORLD DEVELOPED UNDER THE SWAY OF THE APOLLINIAN IMPULSE TO BEAUTY; THAT THIS ‚ÄÚNA√ØVE‚ÄÙ SPLENDOR WAS AGAIN OVERWHELMED BY THE INFLUX OF THE DIONYSIAN; AND THAT AGAINST THIS NEW POWER THE APOLLINIAN ROSE TO THE AUSTERE MAJESTY OF DORIC ART AND THE DORIC VIEW OF THE WORLD. IF AMID THE STRIFE OF THESE TWO HOSTILE PRINCIPLES, THE OLDER HELLENIC HISTORY THUS FALLS INTO FOUR GREAT PERIODS OF ART, WE ARE NOW IMPELLED TO INQUIRE AFTER THE FINAL GOAL OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND PROCESSES, LEST PERCHANCE WE SHOULD REGARD THE LAST-ATTAINED PERIOD, THE PERIOD OF DORIC ART, AS THE CLIMAX AND AIM OF THESE ARTISTIC IMPULSES. AND HERE THE SUBLIME AND CELEBRATED ART OF ATTIC TRAGEDY AND THE DRAMATIC DITHYRAMB PRESENTS ITSELF AS THE COMMON GOAL OF BOTH THESE TENDENCIES WHOSE MYSTERIOUS UNION, AFTER MANY AND LONG PRECURSORY STRUGGLES, FOUND GLORIUS CONSUMMATION IN THIS CHILD‚ÄÎAT ONCE ANTIGONE AND CASSANDRA.WE NOW APPROACH THE REAL GOAL OF OUR INVESTIGATION, WHICH IS DIRECTED TOWARD KNOWLEDGE OF THE DIONYSIAN-APOLLINIAN GENIUS AND ITS ART PRODUCT, OR AT LEAST TOWARD SOME FEELING FOR AND UNDERSTANDING OF THIS MYSTERY OF UNION. HERE WE SHALL BEGIN BY SEEKING THE FIRST EVIDENCE IN GREECE OF THAT NEW GERM WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY DEVELOPED INTO TRAGEDY AND THE DRAMATIC DITHYRAMB. THE ANCIENTS THEMSELVES GIVE US A SYMBOLIC ANSWER, WHEN THEY PLACE THE FACES OF HOMER AND ARCHILOCHUS,1 AS THE FOREFATHERS AND TORCHBEARERS OF GREEK POETRY, SIDE BY SIDE ON GEMS, SCULPTURES, ETC., WITH A SURE FEELING THAT CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN ONLY TO THESE TWO, EQUALLY COMPLETELY ORIGINAL, FROM WHOM A STREAM OF FIRE FLOWS OVER THE WHOLE OF LATER GREEK HISTORY. HOMER, THE AGED SELF-ABSORBED DREAMER, THE TYPE OF THE APOLLINIAN NA√ØVE ARTIST, NOW BEHOLDS WITH ASTONISHMENT THE PASSIONATE HEAD OF THE WARLIKE VOTARY OF THE MUSES, ARCHILOCHUS, WHO WAS HUNTED SAVAGELY THROUGH LIFE. MODERN AESTHETICS, BY WAY OF INTERPRETATION, COULD ONLY ADD THAT HERE THE FIRST ‚ÄÚOBJECTIVE‚ÄÙ ARTIST CONFRONTS THE FIRST ‚ÄÚSUBJECTIVE‚ÄÙ ARTIST. BUT THIS INTERPRETATION HELPS US LITTLE, BECAUSE WE KNOW THE SUBJECTIVE ARTIST ONLY AS THE POOR ARTIST, AND THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE RANGE OF ART WE DEMAND FIRST OF ALL THE CONQUEST OF THE SUBJECTIVE, REDEMPTION FROM THE ‚ÄÚEGO,‚ÄÙ AND THE SILENCING OF THE INDIVIDUAL WILL AND DESIRE; INDEED, WE FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE IN ANY TRULY ARTISTIC PRODUCTION, HOWEVER INSIGNIFICANT, IF IT IS WITHOUT OBJECTIVITY, WITHOUT PURE CONTEMPLATION DEVOID OF INTEREST.2 HENCE OUR AESTHETICS MUST FIRST SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF HOW THE ‚ÄÚLYRIST‚ÄÙ IS POSSIBLE AS AN ARTIST‚ÄÎHE WHO, ACCORDING TO THE EXPERIENCE OF ALL AGES, IS CONTINUALLY SAYING ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÙ AND RUNNING THROUGH THE ENTIRE CHROMATIC SCALE OF HIS PASSIONS AND DESIRES. COMPARED WITH HOMER, ARCHILOCHUS APPALLS US BY HIS CRIES OF HATRED AND SCORN, BY HIS DRUNKEN OUTBURSTS OF DESIRE. THEREFORE IS NOT HE, WHO HAS BEEN CALLED THE FIRST SUBJECTIVE ARTIST, ESSENTIALLY THE NON-ARTIST? BUT IN THIS CASE, HOW EXPLAIN THE REVERENCE WHICH WAS SHOWN TO HIM‚ÄÎTHE POET‚ÄÎIN VERY REMARKABLE UTTERANCES BY THE DELPHIC ORACLE ITSELF, THE CENTER OF ‚ÄÚOBJECTIVE‚ÄÙ ART?SCHILLER HAS THROWN SOME LIGHT ON THE POETIC PROCESS BY A PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION, INEXPLICABLE BUT UNPROBLEMATIC TO HIS OWN MIND. HE CONFESSED THAT BEFORE THE ACT OF CREATION HE DID NOT HAVE BEFORE HIM OR WITHIN HIM ANY SERIES OF IMAGES IN A CAUSAL ARRANGEMENT, BUT RATHER A MUSICAL MOOD. (‚ÄÚWITH ME THE PERCEPTION HAS AT FIRST NO CLEAR AND DEFINITE OBJECT; THIS IS FORMED LATER. A CERTAIN MUSICAL MOOD COMES FIRST, AND THE POETICAL IDEA ONLY FOLLOWS LATER.‚ÄÙ) LET US ADD TO THIS THE MOST IMPORTANT PHENOMENON OF ALL ANCIENT LYRIC POETRY: THEY TOOK FOR GRANTED THE UNION, INDEED THE IDENTITY, OF THE LYRIST WITH THE MUSICIAN. COMPARED WITH THIS, OUR MODERN LYRIC POETRY SEEMS LIKE THE STATUE OF A GOD WITHOUT A HEAD. WITH THIS IN MIND WE MAY NOW, ON THE BASIS OF OUR AESTHETICAL METAPHYSICS SET FORTH ABOVE, EXPLAIN THE LYRIST TO OURSELVES IN THIS MANNER.IN THE FIRST PLACE, AS A DIONYSIAN ARTIST HE HAS IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH THE PRIMAL UNITY, ITS PAIN AND CONTRADICTION. ASSUMING THAT MUSIC HAS BEEN CORRECTLY TERMED A REPETITION AND A RECAST OF THE WORLD, WE MAY SAY THAT HE PRODUCES THE COPY OF THIS PRIMAL UNITY AS MUSIC. NOW, HOWEVER, UNDER THE APOLLINIAN DREAM INSPIRATION, THIS MUSIC REVEALS ITSELF TO HIM AGAIN AS A SYMBOLIC DREAM IMAGE. THE INCHOATE, INTANGIBLE REFLECTION OF THE PRIMORDIAL PAIN IN MUSIC, WITH ITS REDEMPTION IN MERE APPEARANCE, NOW PRODUCES A SECOND MIRRORING AS A SPECIFIC SYMBOL OR EXAMPLE. THE ARTIST HAS ALREADY SURRENDERED HIS SUBJECTIVITY IN THE DIONYSIAN PROCESS. THE IMAGE THAT NOW SHOWS HIM HIS IDENTITY WITH THE HEART OF THE WORLD IS A DREAM SCENE THAT EMBODIES THE PRIMORDIAL CONTRADICTION AND PRIMORDIAL PAIN, TOGETHER WITH THE PRIMORDIAL PLEASURE, OF MERE APPEARANCE. THE ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÙ OF THE LYRIST THEREFORE SOUNDS FROM THE DEPTH OF HIS BEING: ITS ‚ÄÚSUBJECTIVITY,‚ÄÙ IN THE SENSE OF MODERN AESTHETICIANS IS A FICTION. WHEN ARCHILOCHUS, THE FIRST GREEK LYRIST, PROCLAIMS TO THE DAUGHTERS OF LYCAMBES BOTH HIS MAD LOVE AND HIS CONTEMPT, IT IS NOT HIS PASSION ALONE THAT DANCES BEFORE US IN ORGIASTIC FRENZY; BUT WE SEE DIONYSUS AND THE MAENADS, WE SEE THE DRUNKEN REVELER ARCHILOCHUS SUNK DOWN IN SLUMBER‚ÄÎAS EURIPIDES DEPICTS IT IN THE BACCHAE,3 THE SLEEP ON THE HIGH MOUNTAIN PASTURE, IN THE NOONDAY SUN. AND NOW APOLLO APPROACHES AND TOUCHES HIM WITH THE LAUREL. THEN THE DIONYSIAN-MUSICAL ENCHANTMENT OF THE SLEEPER SEEMS TO EMIT IMAGE SPARKS, LYRICAL POEMS, WHICH IN THEIR HIGHEST DEVELOPMENT ARE CALLED TRAGEDIES AND DRAMATIC DITHYRAMBS.THE PLASTIC ARTIST, LIKE THE EPIC POET WHO IS RELATED TO HIM, IS ABSORBED IN THE PURE CONTEMPLATION OF IMAGES. THE DIONYSIAN MUSICIAN IS, WITHOUT ANY IMAGES, HIMSELF PURE PRIMORDIAL PAIN AND ITS PRIMORDIAL RE-ECHOING. THE LYRIC GENIUS IS CONSCIOUS OF A WORLD OF IMAGES AND SYMBOLS‚ÄÎGROWING OUT OF HIS STATE OF MYSTICAL SELF-ABNEGATION AND ONENESS. THIS WORLD HAS A COLORING, A CAUSALITY, AND A VELOCITY QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE WORLD OF THE PLASTIC ARTIST AND THE EPIC POET. FOR THE LATTER LIVES IN THESE IMAGES, AND ONLY IN THEM, WITH JOYOUS SATISFACTION. HE NEVER GROWS TIRED OF CONTEMPLATING LOVINGLY EVEN THEIR MINUTEST TRAITS. EVEN THE IMAGE OF THE ANGRY ACHILLES IS ONLY AN IMAGE TO HIM WHOSE ANGRY EXPRESSION HE ENJOYS WITH THE DREAMER‚ÄÔS PLEASURE IN ILLUSION. THUS, BY THIS MIRROR OF ILLUSION, HE IS PROTECTED AGAINST BECOMING ONE AND FUSED WITH HIS FIGURES. IN DIRECT CONTRAST TO THIS, THE IMAGES OF THE LYRIST ARE NOTHING BUT HIS VERY SELF AND, AS IT WERE, ONLY DIFFERENT PROJECTIONS OF HIMSELF, SO HE, AS THE MOVING CENTER OF THIS WORLD, MAY SAY ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÙ: OF COURSE, THIS SELF IS NOT THE SAME AS THAT OF THE WAKING, EMPIRICALLY REAL MAN, BUT THE ONLY TRULY EXISTENT AND ETERNAL SELF RESTING AT THE BASIS OF THINGS, THROUGH WHOSE IMAGES THE LYRIC GENIUS SEES THIS VERY BASIS.NOW LET US SUPPOSE THAT AMONG THESE IMAGES HE ALSO BEHOLDS HIMSELF AS NONGENIUS, I.E., HIS SUBJECT, THE WHOLE THRONG OF SUBJECTIVE PASSIONS AND AGITATIONS OF THE WILL DIRECTED TO A DEFINITE OBJECT WHICH APPEARS REAL TO HIM. IT MIGHT SEEM AS IF THE LYRIC GENIUS AND THE ALLIED NON-GENIUS WERE ONE, AS IF THE FORMER HAD OF ITS OWN ACCORD SPOKEN THAT LITTLE WORD ‚ÄÚI.‚ÄÙ BUT THIS MERE APPEARANCE WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO LEAD US ASTRAY, AS IT CERTAINLY LED ASTRAY THOSE WHO DESIGNATED THE LYRIST AS THE SUBJECTIVE POET. FOR, AS A MATTER OF FACT, ARCHILOCHUS, THE PASSIONATELY INFLAMED, LOVING, AND HATING MAN, IS BUT A VISION OF THE GENIUS, WHO BY THIS TIME IS NO LONGER MERELY ARCHILOCHUS, BUT A WORLD-GENIUS EXPRESSING HIS PRIMORDIAL PAIN SYMBOLICALLY IN THE SYMBOL OF THE MAN ARCHILOCHUS‚ÄÎWHILE THE SUBJECTIVELY WILLING AND DESIRING MAN, ARCHILOCHUS, CAN NEVER AT ANY TIME BE A POET. IT IS BY NO MEANS NECESSARY, HOWEVER, THAT THE LYRIST SHOULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE PHENOMENON OF THE MAN ARCHILOCHUS BEFORE HIM AS A REFLECTION OF ETERNAL BEING; AND TRAGEDY SHOWS HOW FAR THE VISIONARY WORLD OF THE LYRIST MAY BE REMOVED FROM THIS PHENOMENON WHICH, TO BE SURE, IS CLOSEST AT HAND.SCHOPENHAUER, WHO DID NOT CONCEAL FROM HIMSELF THE DIFFICULTY THE LYRIST PRESENTS IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL CONTEMPLATION OF ART, THOUGHT HE HAD FOUND A WAY OUT ON WHICH, HOWEVER, I CANNOT FOLLOW HIM. ACTUALLY, IT WAS IN HIS PROFOUND METAPHYSICS OF MUSIC THAT HE ALONE HELD IN HIS HANDS THE MEANS FOR A SOLUTION. I BELIEVE I HAVE REMOVED THE DIFFICULTY HERE IN HIS SPIRIT AND TO HIS HONOR. YET HE DESCRIBES THE PECULIAR NATURE OF SONG AS FOLLOWS (WELT ALS WILLE UND VORSTELLUNG, I):‚ÄÚIT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE WILL, I.E., HIS OWN VOLITION, WHICH FILLS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE SINGER, OFTEN AS A RELEASED AND SATISFIED DESIRE (JOY), BUT STILL OFTENER AS AN INHIBITED DESIRE (GRIEF), ALWAYS AS AN AFFECT, A PASSION, A MOVED STATE OF MIND. BESIDES THIS, HOWEVER, AND ALONG WITH IT, BY THE SIGHT OF SURROUNDING NATURE, THE SINGER BECOMES CONSCIOUS OF HIMSELF AS THE SUBJECT OF PURE WILL-LESS KNOWING, WHOSE UNBROKEN BLISSFUL PEACE NOW APPEARS, IN CONTRAST TO THE STRESS OF DESIRE, WHICH IS ALWAYS RESTRICTED AND ALWAYS NEEDY. THE FEELING OF THIS CONTRAST, THIS ALTERNATION, IS REALLY WHAT THE SONG AS A WHOLE EXPRESSES AND WHAT PRINCIPALLY CONSTITUTES THE LYRICAL STATE. IN IT PURE KNOWING COMES TO US AS IT WERE TO DELIVER US FROM WILLING AND ITS STRAIN; WE FOLLOW, BUT ONLY FOR MOMENTS; WILLING, THE REMEMBRANCE OF OUR OWN PERSONAL ENDS, TEARS US ANEW FROM PEACEFUL CONTEMPLATION; YET EVER AGAIN THE NEXT BEAUTIFUL ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PURE WILL-LESS KNOWLEDGE PRESENTS ITSELF TO US LURES US AWAY FROM WILLING. THEREFORE, IN THE SONG AND THE LYRICAL MOOD, WILLING (THE PERSONAL INTEREST OF THE ENDS) AND PURE PERCEPTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT ARE WONDERFULLY MINGLED; CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THEM ARE SOUGHT AND IMAGINED; THE SUBJECTIVE MOOD, THE AFFECTION OF THE WILL, IMPARTS ITS OWN HUE TO THE PERCEIVED ENVIRONMENT, AND VICE VERSA. GENUINE SONG IS THE EXPRESSION OF THE WHOLE OF THIS MINGLED AND DIVIDED STATE OF MIND.‚ÄÙWHO COULD FAIL TO RECOGNIZE IN THIS DESCRIPTION THAT LYRIC POETRY IS HERE CHARACTERIZED AS AN INCOMPLETELY ATTAINED ART THAT ARRIVES AT ITS GOAL INFREQUENTLY AND ONLY, AS IT WERE, BY LEAPS? INDEED, IT IS DESCRIBED AS A SEMI-ART WHOSE ESSENCE IS SAID TO CONSIST IN THIS, THAT WILLING AND PURE CONTEMPLATION, I.E., THE UNAESTHETIC AND THE AESTHETIC CONDITION, ARE WONDERFULLY MINGLED WITH EACH OTHER. WE CONTEND, ON THE CONTRARY, THAT THE WHOLE OPPOSITION BETWEEN THE SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE, WHICH SCHOPENHAUER STILL USES AS A MEASURE OF VALUE IN CLASSIFYING THE ARTS, IS ALTOGETHER IRRELEVANT IN AESTHETICS, SINCE THE SUBJECT, THE WILLING INDIVIDUAL THAT FURTHERS HIS OWN EGOISTIC ENDS, CAN BE CONCEIVED OF ONLY AS THE ANTAGONIST, NOT AS THE ORIGIN OF ART. INSOFAR AS THE SUBJECT IS THE ARTIST, HOWEVER, HE HAS ALREADY BEEN RELEASED FROM HIS INDIVIDUAL WILL, AND HAS BECOME, AS IT WERE, THE MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH THE ONE TRULY EXISTENT SUBJECT CELEBRATES HIS RELEASE IN APPEARANCE. FOR TO OUR HUMILIATION AND EXALTATION, ONE THING ABOVE ALL MUST BE CLEAR TO US. THE ENTIRE COMEDY OF ART IS NEITHER PERFORMED FOR OUR BETTERMENT OR EDUCATION NOR ARE WE THE TRUE AUTHORS OF THIS ART WORLD. ON THE CONTRARY, WE MAY ASSUME THAT WE ARE MERELY IMAGES AND ARTISTIC PROJECTIONS FOR THE TRUE AUTHOR, AND THAT WE HAVE OUR HIGHEST DIGNITY IN OUR SIGNIFICANCE AS WORKS OF ART‚ÄÎFOR IT IS ONLY AS AN AESTHETIC PHENOMENON THAT EXISTENCE AND THE WORLD ARE ETERNALLY JUSTIFIED5‚ÄÎWHILE OF COURSE OUR CONSCIOUSNESS OF OUR OWN SIGNIFICANCE HARDLY DIFFERS FROM THAT WHICH THE SOLDIERS PAINTED ON CANVAS HAVE OF THE BATTLE REPRESENTED ON IT. THUS ALL OUR KNOWLEDGE OF ART IS BASICALLY QUITE ILLUSORY, BECAUSE AS KNOWING BEINGS WE ARE NOT ONE AND IDENTICAL WITH THAT BEING WHICH, AS THE SOLE AUTHOR AND SPECTATOR OF THIS COMEDY OF ART, PREPARES A PERPETUAL ENTERTAINMENT FOR ITSELF. ONLY INSOFAR AS THE GENIUS IN THE ACT OF ARTISTIC CREATION COALESCES WITH THIS PRIMORDIAL ARTIST OF THE WORLD, DOES HE KNOW ANYTHING OF THE ETERNAL ESSENCE OF ART; FOR IN THIS STATE HE IS, IN A MARVELOUS MANNER, LIKE THE WEIRD IMAGE OF THE FAIRY TALE WHICH CAN TURN ITS EYES AT WILL AND BEHOLD ITSELF; HE IS AT ONCE SUBJECT AND OBJECT, AT ONCE POET, ACTOR, AND SPECTATOR.IN CONNECTION WITH ARCHILOCHUS, SCHOLARLY RESEARCH HAS DISCOVERED THAT HE INTRODUCED THE FOLK SONG INTO LITERATURE AND ON ACCOUNT OF THIS DESERVED, ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL ESTIMATE OF THE GREEKS, HIS UNIQUE POSITION BESIDE HOMER. BUT WHAT IS THE FOLK SONG IN CONTRAST TO THE WHOLLY APOLLINIAN EPOS? WHAT ELSE BUT THE PERPETUUM VESTIGIUM OF A UNION OF THE APOLLINIAN AND THE DIONYSIAN? ITS ENORMOUS DIFFUSION AMONG ALL PEOPLES, FURTHER RE-ENFORCED BY EVER-NEW BIRTHS, IS TESTIMONY TO THE POWER OF THIS ARTISTIC DUAL IMPULSE OF NATURE, WHICH LEAVES ITS VESTIGES IN THE FOLK SONG JUST AS THE ORGIASTIC MOVEMENTS OF A PEOPLE IMMORTALIZE THEMSELVES IN ITS MUSIC. INDEED, IT MIGHT ALSO BE HISTORICALLY DEMONSTRABLE THAT EVERY PERIOD RICH IN FOLK SONGS HAS BEEN MOST VIOLENTLY STIRRED BY DIONYSIAN CURRENTS, WHICH WE MUST ALWAYS CONSIDER THE SUBSTRATUM AND PREREQUISITE OF THE FOLK SONG.FIRST OF ALL, HOWEVER, WE MUST CONCEIVE THE FOLK SONG AS THE MUSICAL MIRROR OF THE WORLD, AS THE ORIGINAL MELODY, NOW SEEKING FOR ITSELF A PARALLEL DREAM PHENOMENON AND EXPRESSING IT IN POETRY. MELODY IS THEREFORE PRIMARY AND UNIVERSAL, AND SO MAY ADMIT OF SEVERAL OBJECTIFICATIONS IN SEVERAL TEXTS. LIKEWISE, IN THE NA√ØVE ESTIMATION OF THE PEOPLE, IT IS REGARDED AS BY FAR THE MORE IMPORTANT AND ESSENTIAL ELEMENT. MELODY GENERATES THE POEM OUT OF ITSELF, EVER AGAIN: THAT IS WHAT THE STROPHIC FORM OF THE FOLK SONG SIGNIFIES; A PHENOMENON WHICH I HAD ALWAYS BEHELD WITH ASTONISHMENT, UNTIL AT LAST I FOUND THIS EXPLANATION. ANYONE WHO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS THEORY EXAMINES A COLLECTION OF FOLK SONGS, SUCH AS DES KNABEN WUNDERHORN,1 WILL FIND INNUMERABLE INSTANCES OF THE WAY THE CONTINUOUSLY GENERATING MELODY SCATTERS IMAGE SPARKS ALL AROUND, WHICH IN THEIR VARIEGATION, THEIR ABRUPT CHANGE, THEIR MAD PRECIPITATION, MANIFEST A POWER QUITE UNKNOWN TO THE EPIC AND ITS STEADY FLOW. FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE EPOS, THIS UNEQUAL AND IRREGULAR IMAGE WORLD OF LYRICAL POETRY IS SIMPLY TO BE CONDEMNED: AND IT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN THUS CONDEMNED BY THE SOLEMN EPIC RHAPSODISTS OF THE APOLLINIAN FESTIVALS IN THE AGE OF TERPANDER.ACCORDINGLY, WE OBSERVE THAT IN THE POETRY OF THE FOLK SONG, LANGUAGE IS STRAINED TO ITS UTMOST THAT IT MAY IMITATE MUSIC; AND WITH ARCHILOCHUS BEGINS A NEW WORLD OF POETRY, BASICALLY OPPOSED TO THE HOMERIC. AND IN SAYING THIS WE HAVE INDICATED THE ONLY POSSIBLE RELATION BETWEEN POETRY AND MUSIC, BETWEEN WORD AND TONE: THE WORD, THE IMAGE, THE CONCEPT HERE SEEKS AN EXPRESSION ANALOGOUS TO MUSIC AND NOW FEELS IN ITSELF THE POWER OF MUSIC. IN THIS SENSE WE MAY DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN TWO MAIN CURRENTS IN THE HISTORY OF THE LANGUAGE OF THE GREEK PEOPLE, ACCORDING TO WHETHER THEIR LANGUAGE IMITATED THE WORLD OF IMAGE AND PHENOMENON OR THE WORLD OF MUSIC. ONE NEED ONLY REFLECT MORE DEEPLY ON THE LINGUISTIC DIFFERENCE WITH REGARD TO COLOR, SYNTACTICAL STRUCTURE, AND VOCABULARY IN HOMER AND PINDAR, IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS CONTRAST; INDEED, IT BECOMES PALPABLY CLEAR THAT IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN HOMER AND PINDAR THE ORGIASTIC FLUTE TONES OF OLYMPUS MUST HAVE BEEN SOUNDED, WHICH, EVEN IN ARISTOTLE‚ÄÔS TIME, WHEN MUSIC WAS INFINITELY MORE DEVELOPED, TRANSPORTED PEOPLE TO DRUNKEN ECSTASY, AND WHICH, IN THEIR PRIMITIVE STATE OF DEVELOPMENT, UNDOUBTEDLY INCITED TO IMITATION ALL THE POETIC MEANS OF EXPRESSION OF CONTEMPORANEOUS MAN.I HERE CALL ATTENTION TO A FAMILIAR PHENOMENON OF OUR OWN TIMES, AGAINST WHICH OUR AESTHETIC RAISES MANY OBJECTIONS. AGAIN AND AGAIN WE HAVE OCCASION TO OBSERVE THAT A BEETHOVEN SYMPHONY COMPELS ITS INDIVIDUAL AUDITORS TO USE FIGURATIVE SPEECH IN DESCRIBING IT, NO MATTER HOW FANTASTICALLY VARIEGATED AND EVEN CONTRADICTORY MAY BE THE COMPOSITION AND MAKE-UP OF THE DIFFERENT WORLDS OF IMAGES PRODUCED BY A PIECE OF MUSIC. TO EXERCISE ITS POOR WIT ON SUCH COMPOSITIONS, AND TO OVERLOOK A PHENOMENON WHICH IS CERTAINLY WORTH EXPLAINING, ARE QUITE IN KEEPING WITH THIS AESTHETIC. INDEED, EVEN WHEN THE TONE-POET EXPRESSES HIS COMPOSITION IN IMAGES, WHEN FOR INSTANCE HE DESIGNATES A CERTAIN SYMPHONY AS THE ‚ÄÚPASTORAL‚ÄÙ SYMPHONY, OR A PASSAGE IN IT AS THE ‚ÄÚSCENE BY THE BROOK,‚ÄÙ OR ANOTHER AS THE ‚ÄÚMERRY GATHERING OF RUSTICS,‚ÄÙ THESE TWO ARE ONLY SYMBOLICAL REPRESENTATIONS BORN OF MUSIC‚ÄÎAND NOT THE IMITATED OBJECTS OF MUSIC‚ÄÎREPRESENTATIONS WHICH CAN TEACH US NOTHING WHATSOEVER CONCERNING THE DIONYSIAN CONTENT OF MUSIC, AND WHICH INDEED HAVE NO DISTINCTIVE VALUE OF THEIR OWN BESIDE OTHER IMAGES. WE HAVE NOW TO TRANSFER THIS PROCESS OF A DISCHARGE OF MUSIC IN IMAGES TO SOME FRESH, YOUTHFUL, LINGUISTICALLY CREATIVE PEOPLE, IN ORDER TO GET SOME NOTION OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE STROPHIC FOLK SONG ORIGINATES, AND THE WHOLE LINGUISTIC CAPACITY IS EXCITED BY THIS NEW PRINCIPLE OF THE IMITATION OF MUSIC.IF, THEREFORE, WE MAY REGARD LYRIC POETRY AS THE IMITATIVE FULGURATION OF MUSIC IN IMAGES AND CONCEPTS, WE SHOULD NOW ASK: ‚ÄÚAS WHAT DOES MUSIC APPEAR IN THE MIRROR OF IMAGES AND CONCEPTS?‚ÄÙ IT APPEARS AS WILL, TAKING THE TERM IN SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS SENSE, I.E., AS THE OPPOSITE OF THE AESTHETIC, PURELY CONTEMPLATIVE, AND PASSIVE FRAME OF MIND. HERE, HOWEVER, WE MUST MAKE AS SHARP A DISTINCTION AS POSSIBLE BETWEEN THE CONCEPTS OF ESSENCE AND PHENOMENON; FOR MUSIC, ACCORDING TO ITS ESSENCE, CANNOT POSSIBLY BE WILL. TO BE WILL IT WOULD HAVE TO BE WHOLLY BANISHED FROM THE REALM OF ART‚ÄÎFOR THE WILL IS THE UNAESTHETIC-IN-ITSELF; BUT IT APPEARS AS WILL. FOR IN ORDER TO EXPRESS ITS APPEARANCE IN IMAGES, THE LYRIST NEEDS ALL THE AGITATIONS OF PASSION, FROM THE WHISPER OF MERE INCLINATION TO THE ROAR OF MADNESS. IMPELLED TO SPEAK OF MUSIC IN APOLLINIAN SYMBOLS, HE CONCEIVES OF ALL NATURE, AND HIMSELF IN IT, AS WILLING, AS DESIRING, AS ETERNAL LONGING. BUT INSOFAR AS HE INTERPRETS MUSIC BY MEANS OF IMAGES, HE HIMSELF RESTS IN THE CALM SEA OF APOLLINIAN CONTEMPLATION, THOUGH EVERYTHING AROUND HIM THAT HE BEHOLDS THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF MUSIC IS IN URGENT AND ACTIVE MOTION. INDEED, WHEN HE BEHOLDS HIMSELF THROUGH THIS SAME MEDIUM, HIS OWN IMAGE APPEARS TO HIM AS AN UNSATISFIED FEELING: HIS OWN WILLING, LONGING, MOANING, REJOICING, ARE TO HIM SYMBOLS BY WHICH HE INTERPRETS MUSIC. THIS IS THE PHENOMENON OF THE LYRIST: AS APOLLINIAN GENIUS HE INTERPRETS MUSIC THROUGH THE IMAGE OF THE WILL, WHILE HE HIMSELF, COMPLETELY RELEASED FROM THE GREED OF THE WILL, IS THE PURE, UNDIMMED EYE OF THE SUN.OUR WHOLE DISCUSSION INSISTS THAT LYRIC POETRY IS DEPENDENT ON THE SPIRIT OF MUSIC JUST AS MUSIC ITSELF IN ITS ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGNTY DOES NOT NEED THE IMAGE AND THE CONCEPT, BUT MERELY ENDURES THEM AS ACCOMPANIMENTS. THE POEMS OF THE LYRIST CAN EXPRESS NOTHING THAT DID NOT ALREADY LIE HIDDEN IN THAT VAST UNIVERSALITY AND ABSOLUTENESS IN THE MUSIC THAT COMPELLED HIM TO FIGURATIVE SPEECH. LANGUAGE CAN NEVER ADEQUATELY RENDER THE COSMIC SYMBOLISM OF MUSIC, BECAUSE MUSIC STANDS IN SYMBOLIC RELATION TO THE PRIMORDIAL CONTRADICTION AND PRIMORDIAL PAIN IN THE HEART OF THE PRIMAL UNITY, AND THEREFORE SYMBOLIZES A SPHERE WHICH IS BEYOND AND PRIOR TO ALL PHENOMENA. RATHER, ALL PHENOMENA, COMPARED WITH IT, ARE MERELY SYMBOLS: HENCE LANGUAGE, AS THE ORGAN AND SYMBOL OF PHENOMENA, CAN NEVER BY ANY MEANS DISCLOSE THE INNERMOST HEART OF MUSIC; LANGUAGE, IN ITS ATTEMPT TO IMITATE IT, CAN ONLY BE IN SUPERFICIAL CONTACT WITH MUSIC; WHILE ALL THE ELOQUENCE OF LYRIC POETRY CANNOT BRING THE DEEPEST SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LATTER ONE STEP NEARER TO US.WE MUST NOW AVAIL OURSELVES OF ALL THE PRINCIPLES OF ART CONSIDERED SO FAR, IN ORDER TO FIND OUR WAY THROUGH THE LABYRINTH, AS WE MUST CALL IT, OF THE ORIGIN OF GREEK TRAGEDY. I DO NOT THINK I AM UNREASONABLE IN SAYING THAT THE PROBLEM OF THIS ORIGIN HAS AS YET NOT EVEN BEEN SERIOUSLY POSED, TO SAY NOTHING OF SOLVED, HOWEVER OFTEN THE RAGGED TATTERS OF ANCIENT TRADITION HAVE BEEN SEWN TOGETHER IN VARIOUS COMBINATIONS AND TORN APART AGAIN. THIS TRADITION TELLS US QUITE UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT TRAGEDY AROSE FROM THE TRAGIC CHORUS, AND WAS ORIGINALLY ONLY CHORUS AND NOTHING BUT CHORUS. HENCE WE CONSIDER IT OUR DUTY TO LOOK INTO THE HEART OF THIS TRAGIC CHORUS AS THE REAL PROTO-DRAMA, WITHOUT RESTING SATISFIED WITH SUCH ARTY CLICH√©S AS THAT THE CHORUS IS THE ‚ÄÚIDEAL SPECTATOR‚ÄÙ OR THAT IT REPRESENTS THE PEOPLE IN CONTRAST TO THE ARISTOCRATIC REGION OF THE SCENE. THIS LATTER EXPLANATION HAS A SUBLIME SOUND TO MANY A POLITICIAN‚ÄÎAS IF THE IMMUTABLE MORAL LAW HAD BEEN EMBODIED BY THE DEMOCRATIC ATHENIANS IN THE POPULAR CHORUS, WHICH ALWAYS WON OUT OVER THE PASSIONATE EXCESSES AND EXTRAVAGANCES OF KINGS. THIS THEORY MAY BE EVER SO FORCIBLY SUGGESTED BY ONE OF ARISTOTLE‚ÄÔS OBSERVATIONS; STILL, IT HAS NO INFLUENCE ON THE ORIGINAL FORMATION OF TRAGEDY, INASMUCH AS THE WHOLE OPPOSITION OF PRINCE AND PEOPLE‚ÄÎINDEED THE WHOLE POLITICO-SOCIAL SPHERE‚ÄÎWAS EXCLUDED FROM THE PURELY RELIGIOUS ORIGINS OF TRAGEDY. BUT EVEN REGARDING THE CLASSICAL FORM OF THE CHORUS IN AESCHYLUS AND SOPHOCLES, WHICH IS KNOWN TO US, WE SHOULD DEEM IT BLASPHEMY TO SPEAK HERE OF INTIMATIONS OF ‚ÄÚCONSTITUTIONAL POPULAR REPRESENTATION.‚ÄÙ FROM THIS BLASPHEMY, HOWEVER, OTHERS HAVE NOT SHRUNK. ANCIENT CONSTITUTIONS KNEW OF NO CONSTITUTIONAL REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE IN PRAXI, AND IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THEY DID NOT EVEN ‚ÄÚHAVE INTIMATIONS‚ÄÙ OF IT IN TRAGEDY.MUCH MORE FAMOUS THAN THIS POLITICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE CHORUS IS THE IDEA OF A. W. SCHLEGEL,1 WHO ADVISES US TO REGARD THE CHORUS SOMEHOW AS THE ESSENCE AND EXTRACT OF THE CROWD OF SPECTATORS‚ÄÎAS THE ‚ÄÚIDEAL SPECTATOR.‚ÄÙ THIS VIEW, WHEN COMPARED WITH THE HISTORICAL TRADITION THAT ORIGINALLY TRAGEDY WAS ONLY CHORUS, REVEALS ITSELF FOR WHAT IT IS‚ÄÎA CRUDE, UNSCIENTIFIC, YET BRILLIANT CLAIM THAT OWES ITS BRILLIANCY ONLY TO ITS CONCENTRATED FORM OF EXPRESSION, TO THE TYPICALLY GERMANIC BIAS IN FAVOR OF ANYTHING CALLED ‚ÄÚIDEAL,‚ÄÙ AND TO OUR MOMENTARY ASTONISHMENT. FOR WE ARE CERTAINLY ASTONISHED THE MOMENT WE COMPARE OUR FAMILIAR THEATRICAL PUBLIC WITH THIS CHORUS, AND ASK OURSELVES WHETHER IT COULD EVER BE POSSIBLE TO IDEALIZE FROM SUCH A PUBLIC SOMETHING ANALOGOUS TO THE GREEK TRAGIC CHORUS. WE TACITLY DENY THIS, AND NOW WONDER AS MUCH AT THE BOLDNESS OF SCHLEGEL‚ÄÔS CLAIM AS AT THE TOTALLY DIFFERENT NATURE OF THE GREEK PUBLIC. FOR WE HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE RIGHT SPECTATOR, WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE, MUST ALWAYS REMAIN CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS VIEWING A WORK OF ART AND NOT AN EMPIRICAL REALITY. BUT THE TRAGIC CHORUS OF THE GREEKS IS FORCED TO RECOGNIZE REAL BEINGS IN THE FIGURES ON THE STAGE. THE CHORUS OF THE OCEANIDES REALLY BELIEVES THAT IT SEES BEFORE IT THE TITAN PROMETHEUS, AND IT CONSIDERS ITSELF AS REAL AS THE GOD OF THE SCENE. BUT COULD THE HIGHEST AND PUREST TYPE OF SPECTATOR REGARD PROMETHEUS AS BODILY PRESENT AND REAL, AS THE OCEANIDES DO? IS IT CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IDEAL SPECTATOR TO RUN ONTO THE STAGE AND FREE THE GOD FROM HIS TORMENTS? WE HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED IN AN AESTHETIC PUBLIC AND CONSIDERED THE INDIVIDUAL SPECTATOR THE BETTER QUALIFIED THE MORE HE WAS CAPABLE OF VIEWING A WORK OF ART AS ART, THAT IS, AESTHETICALLY. BUT NOW SCHLEGEL TELLS US THAT THE PERFECT, IDEAL SPECTATOR DOES NOT AT ALL ALLOW THE WORLD OF THE DRAMA TO ACT ON HIM AESTHETICALLY, BUT CORPORALLY AND EMPIRICALLY. OH, THESE GREEKS! WE SIGH; THEY UPSET ALL OUR AESTHETICS! BUT ONCE ACCUSTOMED TO THIS, WE REPEATED SCHLEGEL‚ÄÔS SAYING WHENEVER THE CHORUS CAME UP FOR DISCUSSION.NOW THE TRADITION, WHICH IS QUITE EXPLICIT, SPEAKS AGAINST SCHLEGEL. THE CHORUS AS SUCH, WITHOUT THE STAGE‚ÄÎTHE PRIMITIVE FORM OF TRAGEDY‚ÄÎAND THE CHORUS OF IDEAL SPECTATORS DO NOT GO TOGETHER. WHAT KIND OF ARTISTIC GENRE COULD POSSIBLY BE EXTRACTED FROM THE CONCEPT OF THE SPECTATOR, AND FIND ITS TRUE FORM IN THE ‚ÄÚSPECTATOR AS SUCH‚ÄÙ? THE SPECTATOR WITHOUT THE SPECTACLE IS AN ABSURD NOTION. WE FEAR THAT THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY IS TO BE EXPLAINED NEITHER BY ANY HIGH ESTEEM FOR THE MORAL INTELLIGENCE OF THE MASSES NOR BY THE CONCEPT OF THE SPECTATOR WITHOUT A SPECTACLE; AND WE CONSIDER THE PROBLEM TOO DEEP TO BE EVEN TOUCHED BY SUCH SUPERFICIAL CONSIDERATIONS.AN INFINITELY MORE VALUABLE INSIGHT INTO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHORUS WAS DISPLAYED BY SCHILLER IN THE CELEBRATED PREFACE TO HIS BRIDE OF MESSINA, WHERE HE REGARDS THE CHORUS AS A LIVING WALL THAT TRAGEDY CONSTRUCTS AROUND ITSELF IN ORDER TO CLOSE ITSELF OFF FROM THE WORLD OF REALITY AND TO PRESERVE ITS IDEAL DOMAIN AND ITS POETICAL FREEDOM.WITH THIS, HIS CHIEF WEAPON, SCHILLER COMBATS THE ORDINARY CONCEPTION OF THE NATURAL, THE ILLUSION USUALLY DEMANDED IN DRAMATIC POETRY. ALTHOUGH THE STAGE DAY IS MERELY ARTIFICIAL, THE ARCHITECTURE ONLY SYMBOLICAL, AND THE METRICAL LANGUAGE IDEAL IN CHARACTER, NEVERTHELESS AN ERRONEOUS VIEW STILL PREVAILS IN THE MAIN, AS HE POINTS OUT: IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT THAT ONE MERELY TOLERATES AS POETIC LICENSE WHAT IS ACTUALLY THE ESSENCE OF ALL POETRY. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE CHORUS, SAYS SCHILLER, IS THE DECISIVE STEP BY WHICH WAR IS DECLARED OPENLY AND HONORABLY AGAINST ALL NATURALISM IN ART.IT WOULD SEEM THAT TO DENIGRATE THIS VIEW OF THE MATTER OUR WOULD-BE SUPERIOR AGE HAS COINED THE DISDAINFUL CATCHWORD ‚ÄÚPSEUDO-IDEALISM.‚ÄÙ I FEAR, HOWEVER, THAT WE, ON THE OTHER HAND, WITH OUR PRESENT ADORATION OF THE NATURAL AND THE REAL, HAVE REACHED THE OPPOSITE POLE OF ALL IDEALISM, NAMELY, THE REGION OF WAX-WORK CABINETS. THERE IS AN ART IN THESE, TOO, AS THERE IS IN CERTAIN NOVELS MUCH IN VOGUE AT PRESENT; BUT WE REALLY SHOULD NOT BE PLAGUED WITH THE CLAIM THAT SUCH ART HAS OVERCOME THE ‚ÄÚPSEUDO-IDEALISM‚ÄÙ OF GOETHE AND SCHILLER.IT IS INDEED AN ‚ÄÚIDEAL‚ÄÙ DOMAIN, AS SCHILLER CORRECTLY PERCEIVED, IN WHICH THE GREEK SATYR CHORUS, THE CHORUS OF PRIMITIVE TRAGEDY, WAS WONT TO DWELL. IT IS A DOMAIN RAISED HIGH ABOVE THE ACTUAL PATHS OF MORTALS. FOR THIS CHORUS THE GREEK BUILT UP THE SCAFFOLDING OF A FICTITIOUS NATURAL STATE AND ON IT PLACED FICTITIOUS NATURAL BEINGS. ON THIS FOUNDATION TRAGEDY DEVELOPED AND SO, OF COURSE, IT COULD DISPENSE FROM THE BEGINNING WITH A PAINSTAKING PORTRAYAL OF REALITY. YET IT IS NO ARBITRARY WORLD PLACED BY WHIM BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH; RATHER IT IS A WORLD WITH THE SAME REALITY AND CREDIBILITY THAT OLYMPUS WITH ITS INHABITANTS POSSESSED FOR THE BELIEVING HELLENE. THE SATYR, AS THE DIONYSIAN CHORIST, LIVES IN A RELIGIOUSLY ACKNOWLEDGED REALITY UNDER THE SANCTION OF MYTH AND CULT. THAT TRAGEDY SHOULD BEGIN WITH HIM, THAT HE SHOULD BE THE VOICE OF THE DIONYSIAN WISDOM OF TRAGEDY, IS JUST AS STRANGE A PHENOMENON FOR US AS THE GENERAL DERIVATION OF TRAGEDY FROM THE CHORUS.PERHAPS WE SHALL HAVE A POINT OF DEPARTURE FOR OUR INQUIRY IF I PUT FORWARD THE PROPOSITION THAT THE SATYR, THE FICTITIOUS NATURAL BEING, BEARS THE SAME RELATION TO THE MAN OF CULTURE THAT DIONYSIAN MUSIC BEARS TO CIVILIZATION. CONCERNING THE LATTER, RICHARD WAGNER SAYS THAT IT IS NULLIFIED2 BY MUSIC JUST AS LAMPLIGHT IS NULLIFIED BY THE LIGHT OF DAY. SIMILARLY, I BELIEVE, THE GREEK MAN OF CULTURE FELT HIMSELF NULLIFIED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SATYRIC CHORUS; AND THIS IS THE MOST IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF THE DIONYSIAN TRAGEDY, THAT THE STATE AND SOCIETY AND, QUITE GENERALLY, THE GULFS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN GIVE WAY TO AN OVERWHELMING FEELING OF UNITY LEADING BACK TO THE VERY HEART OF NATURE. THE METAPHYSICAL COMFORT‚ÄÎWITH WHICH, I AM SUGGESTING EVEN NOW, EVERY TRUE TRAGEDY LEAVES US‚ÄÎTHAT LIFE IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THINGS, DESPITE ALL THE CHANGES OF APPEARANCES, INDESTRUCTIBLY POWERFUL AND PLEASURABLE‚ÄÎTHIS COMFORT APPEARS IN INCARNATE CLARITY IN THE CHORUS OF SATYRS, A CHORUS OF NATURAL BEINGS WHO LIVE INERADICABLY, AS IT WERE, BEHIND ALL CIVILIZATION AND REMAIN ETERNALLY THE SAME, DESPITE THE CHANGES OF GENERATIONS AND OF THE HISTORY OF NATIONS.WITH THIS CHORUS THE PROFOUND HELLENE, UNIQUELY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE TENDEREST AND DEEPEST SUFFERING, COMFORTS HIMSELF, HAVING LOOKED BOLDLY RIGHT INTO THE TERRIBLE DESTRUCTIVENESS OF SO-CALLED WORLD HISTORY AS WELL AS THE CRUELTY OF NATURE, AND BEING IN DANGER OF LONGING FOR A BUDDHISTIC NEGATION OF THE WILL.3 ART SAVES HIM, AND THROUGH ART‚ÄÎLIFE.FOR THE RAPTURE OF THE DIONYSIAN STATE WITH ITS ANNIHILATION OF THE ORDINARY BOUNDS AND LIMITS OF EXISTENCE CONTAINS, WHILE IT LASTS, A LETHARGIC ELEMENT IN WHICH ALL PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF THE PAST BECOME IMMERSED. THIS CHASM OF OBLIVION SEPARATES THE WORLDS OF EVERYDAY REALITY AND OF DIONYSIAN REALITY. BUT AS SOON AS THIS EVERYDAY REALITY RE-ENTERS CONSCIOUSNESS, IT IS EXPERIENCED AS SUCH, WITH NAUSEA: AN ASCETIC, WILL-NEGATING MOOD IS THE FRUIT OF THESE STATES.
IN THIS SENSE THE DIONYSIAN MAN RESEMBLES HAMLET: BOTH HAVE ONCE LOOKED TRULY INTO THE ESSENCE OF THINGS, THEY HAVE GAINED KNOWLEDGE, AND NAUSEA INHIBITS ACTION; FOR THEIR ACTION COULD NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE ETERNAL NATURE OF THINGS; THEY FEEL IT TO BE RIDICULOUS OR HUMILIATING THAT THEY SHOULD BE ASKED TO SET RIGHT A WORLD THAT IS OUT OF JOINT. KNOWLEDGE KILLS ACTION; ACTION REQUIRES THE VEILS OF ILLUSION: THAT IS THE DOCTRINE OF HAMLET, NOT THAT CHEAP WISDOM OF JACK THE DREAMER WHO REFLECTS TOO MUCH AND, AS IT WERE, FROM AN EXCESS OF POSSIBILITIES DOES NOT GET AROUND TO ACTION. NOT REFLECTION, NO‚ÄÎTRUE KNOWLEDGE, AN INSIGHT INTO THE HORRIBLE TRUTH, OUTWEIGHS ANY MOTIVE FOR ACTION, BOTH IN HAMLET AND IN THE DIONYSIAN MAN.NOW NO COMFORT AVAILS ANY MORE; LONGING TRANSCENDS A WORLD AFTER DEATH, EVEN THE GODS; EXISTENCE IS NEGATED ALONG WITH ITS GLITTERING REFLECTION IN THE GODS OR IN AN IMMORTAL BEYOND. CONSCIOUS OF THE TRUTH HE HAS ONCE SEEN, MAN NOW SEES EVERYWHERE ONLY THE HORROR OR ABSURDITY OF EXISTENCE; NOW HE UNDERSTANDS WHAT IS SYMBOLIC IN OPHELIA‚ÄÔS FATE; NOW HE UNDERSTANDS THE WISDOM OF THE SYLVAN GOD, SILENUS; HE IS NAUSEATED.HERE, WHEN THE DANGER TO HIS WILL IS GREATEST, ART APPROACHES AS A SAVING SORCERESS, EXPERT AT HEALING. SHE ALONE KNOWS HOW TO TURN THESE NAUSEOUS THOUGHTS ABOUT THE HORROR OR ABSURDITY OF EXISTENCE INTO NOTIONS WITH WHICH ONE CAN LIVE: THESE ARE THE SUBLIME AS THE ARTISTIC TAMING OF THE HORRIBLE, AND THE COMIC AS THE ARTISTIC DISCHARGE OF THE NAUSEA OF ABSURDITY. THE SATYR CHORUS OF THE DITHYRAMB IS THE SAVING DEED OF GREEK ART; FACED WITH THE INTERMEDIARY WORLD OF THESE DIONYSIAN COMPANIONS, THE FEELINGS DESCRIBED HERE EXHAUSTED THEMSELVES.THE SATYR, LIKE THE IDYLLIC SHEPHERD OF MORE RECENT TIMES, IS THE OFFSPRING OF A LONGING FOR THE PRIMITIVE AND THE NATURAL; BUT HOW FIRMLY AND FEARLESSLY THE GREEK EMBRACED THE MAN OF THE WOODS, AND HOW TIMOROUSLY AND MAWKISHLY MODERN MAN DALLIED WITH THE FLATTERING IMAGE OF A SENTIMENTAL, FLUTE-PLAYING, TENDER SHEPHERD! NATURE, AS YET UNCHANGED BY KNOWLEDGE, WITH THE BOLTS OF CULTURE STILL UNBROKEN‚ÄÎTHAT IS WHAT THE GREEK SAW IN HIS SATYR WHO NEVERTHELESS WAS NOT A MERE APE. ON THE CONTRARY, THE SATYR WAS THE ARCHETYPE OF MAN, THE EMBODIMENT OF HIS HIGHEST AND MOST INTENSE EMOTIONS, THE ECSTATIC REVELER ENRAPTURED BY THE PROXIMITY OF HIS GOD, THE SYMPATHETIC COMPANION IN WHOM THE SUFFERING OF THE GOD IS REPEATED, ONE WHO PROCLAIMS WISDOM FROM THE VERY HEART OF NATURE, A SYMBOL OF THE SEXUAL OMNIPOTENCE OF NATURE WHICH THE GREEKS USED TO CONTEMPLATE WITH REVERENT WONDER.THE SATYR WAS SOMETHING SUBLIME AND DIVINE: THUS HE HAD TO APPEAR TO THE PAINFULLY BROKEN VISION OF DIONYSIAN MAN. THE CONTRIVED SHEPHERD IN HIS DRESS-UPS WOULD HAVE OFFENDED HIM: ON THE UNCONCEALED AND VIGOROUSLY MAGNIFICENT CHARACTERS OF NATURE, HIS EYE RESTED WITH SUBLIME SATISFACTION; HERE THE TRUE HUMAN BEING WAS DISCLOSED, THE BEARDED SATYR JUBILATING TO HIS GOD. CONFRONTED WITH HIM, THE MAN OF CULTURE SHRIVELED INTO A MENDACIOUS CARICATURE.SCHILLER IS RIGHT ABOUT THESE ORIGINS OF TRAGIC ART, TOO: THE CHORUS IS A LIVING WALL AGAINST THE ASSAULTS OF REALITY BECAUSE IT‚ÄÎTHE SATYR CHORUS‚ÄÎREPRESENTS EXISTENCE MORE TRUTHFULLY, REALLY, AND COMPLETELY THAN THE MAN OF CULTURE DOES WHO ORDINARILY CONSIDERS HIMSELF AS THE ONLY REALITY. THE SPHERE OF POETRY DOES NOT LIE OUTSIDE THE WORLD AS A FANTASTIC IMPOSSIBILITY SPAWNED BY A POET‚ÄÔS BRAIN: IT DESIRES TO BE JUST THE OPPOSITE, THE UNVARNISHED EXPRESSION OF THE TRUTH, AND MUST PRECISELY FOR THAT REASON DISCARD THE MENDACIOUS FINERY OF THAT ALLEGED REALITY OF THE MAN OF CULTURE.THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THIS REAL TRUTH OF NATURE AND THE LIE OF CULTURE THAT POSES AS IF IT WERE THE ONLY REALITY IS SIMILAR TO THAT BETWEEN THE ETERNAL CORE OF THINGS, THE THING-IN-ITSELF, AND THE WHOLE WORLD OF APPEARANCES:1 JUST AS TRAGEDY, WITH ITS METAPHYSICAL COMFORT, POINTS TO THE ETERNAL LIFE OF THIS CORE OF EXISTENCE WHICH ABIDES THROUGH THE PERPETUAL DESTRUCTION OF APPEARANCES, THE SYMBOLISM OF THE SATYR CHORUS PROCLAIMS THIS PRIMORDIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE THING-IN-ITSELF AND APPEARANCE.2 THE IDYLLIC SHEPHERD OF MODERN MAN IS MERELY A COUNTERFEIT OF THE SUM OF CULTURAL ILLUSIONS THAT ARE ALLEGEDLY NATURE; THE DIONYSIAN GREEK WANTS TRUTH AND NATURE IN THEIR MOST FORCEFUL FORM‚ÄÎAND SEES HIMSELF CHANGED, AS BY MAGIC, INTO A SATYR.THE REVELING THRONG, THE VOTARIES OF DIONYSUS JUBILATE UNDER THE SPELL OF SUCH MOODS AND INSIGHTS WHOSE POWER TRANSFORMS THEM BEFORE THEIR OWN EYES TILL THEY IMAGINE THAT THEY ARE BEHOLDING THEMSELVES AS RESTORED GENIUSES OF NATURE, AS SATYRS. THE LATER CONSTITUTION OF THE CHORUS IN TRAGEDY IS THE ARTISTIC IMITATION OF THIS NATURAL PHENOMENON, THOUGH, TO BE SURE, AT THIS POINT THE SEPARATION OF DIONYSIAN SPECTATORS AND MAGICALLY ENCHANTED DIONYSIANS BECAME NECESSARY. ONLY WE MUST ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND THAT THE PUBLIC AT AN ATTIC TRAGEDY FOUND ITSELF IN THE CHORUS OF THE ORCHESTRA,3 AND THERE WAS AT BOTTOM NO OPPOSITION BETWEEN PUBLIC AND CHORUS: EVERYTHING IS MERELY A GREAT SUBLIME CHORUS OF DANCING AND SINGING SATYRS OR OF THOSE WHO PERMIT THEMSELVES TO BE REPRESENTED BY SUCH SATYRS.NOW WE ARE READY TO UNDERSTAND SCHLEGEL‚ÄÔS FORMULATION IN A DEEPER SENSE. THE CHORUS IS THE ‚ÄÚIDEAL SPECTATOR‚ÄÙ4 INSOFAR AS IT IS THE ONLY BEHOLDER, THE BEHOLDER OF THE VISIONARY WORLD OF THE SCENE.5 A PUBLIC OF SPECTATORS AS WE KNOW IT WAS UNKNOWN TO THE GREEKS: IN THEIR THEATERS THE TERRACED STRUCTURE OF CONCENTRIC ARCS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR EVERYBODY TO ACTUALLY OVERLOOK6 THE WHOLE WORLD OF CULTURE AROUND HIM AND TO IMAGINE, IN ABSORBED CONTEMPLATION, THAT HE HIMSELF WAS A CHORIST.IN THE LIGHT OF THIS INSIGHT WE MAY CALL THE CHORUS IN ITS PRIMITIVE FORM, IN PROTO-TRAGEDY, THE MIRROR IMAGE IN WHICH THE DIONYSIAN MAN CONTEMPLATES HIMSELF. THIS PHENOMENON IS BEST MADE CLEAR BY IMAGINING AN ACTOR WHO, BEING TRULY TALENTED, SEES THE ROLE HE IS SUPPOSED TO PLAY QUITE PALPABLY BEFORE HIS EYES. THE SATYR CHORUS IS, FIRST OF ALL, A VISION OF THE DIONYSIAN MASS OF SPECTATORS, JUST AS THE WORLD OF THE STAGE, IN TURN, IS A VISION OF THIS SATYR CHORUS: THE FORCE OF THIS VISION IS STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE THE EYE INSENSITIVE AND BLIND TO THE IMPRESSION OF ‚ÄÚREALITY,‚ÄÙ TO THE MEN OF CULTURE WHO OCCUPY THE ROWS OF SEATS ALL AROUND. THE FORM OF THE GREEK THEATER RECALLS A LONELY VALLEY IN THE MOUNTAINS: THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE SCENE APPEARS LIKE A LUMINOUS CLOUD FORMATION THAT THE BACCHANTS SWARMING OVER THE MOUNTAINS BEHOLD FROM A HEIGHT‚ÄÎLIKE THE SPLENDID FRAME IN WHICH THE IMAGE OF DIONYSUS IS REVEALED TO THEM.IN THE FACE OF OUR LEARNED VIEWS ABOUT ELEMENTARY ARTISTIC PROCESSES, THIS ARTISTIC PROTO-PHENOMENON WHICH WE BRING UP HERE TO HELP EXPLAIN THE TRAGIC CHORUS IS ALMOST OFFENSIVE, ALTHOUGH NOTHING COULD BE MORE CERTAIN THAN THE FACT THAT A POET IS A POET ONLY INSOFAR AS HE SEES HIMSELF SURROUNDED BY FIGURES WHO LIVE AND ACT BEFORE HIM AND INTO WHOSE INMOST NATURE HE CAN SEE. OWING TO A PECULIAR MODERN WEAKNESS, WE ARE INCLINED TO IMAGINE THE AESTHETIC PROTO-PHENOMENON IN A MANNER MUCH TOO COMPLICATED AND ABSTRACT.FOR A GENUINE POET, METAPHOR IS NOT A RHETORICAL FIGURE BUT A VICARIOUS IMAGE THAT HE ACTUALLY BEHOLDS IN PLACE OF A CONCEPT. A CHARACTER IS FOR HIM NOT A WHOLE HE HAS COMPOSED OUT OF PARTICULAR TRAITS, PICKED UP HERE AND THERE, BUT AN OBTRUSIVELY ALIVE PERSON BEFORE HIS VERY EYES, DISTINGUISHED FROM THE OTHERWISE IDENTICAL VISION OF A PAINTER ONLY BY THE FACT THAT IT CONTINUALLY GOES ON LIVING AND ACTING. HOW IS IT THAT HOMER‚ÄÔS DESCRIPTIONS ARE SO MUCH MORE VIVID THAN THOSE OF ANY OTHER POET? BECAUSE HE VISUALIZES SO MUCH MORE VIVIDLY. WE TALK SO ABSTRACTLY ABOUT POETRY BECAUSE ALL OF US ARE USUALLY BAD POETS. AT BOTTOM, THE AESTHETIC PHENOMENON IS SIMPLE: LET ANYONE HAVE THE ABILITY TO BEHOLD CONTINUALLY A VIVID PLAY AND TO LIVE CONSTANTLY SURROUNDED BY HOSTS OF SPIRITS, AND HE WILL BE A POET; LET ANYONE FEEL THE URGE TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF AND TO SPEAK OUT OF OTHER BODIES AND SOULS, AND HE WILL BE A DRAMATIST.THE DIONYSIAN EXCITEMENT IS CAPABLE OF COMMUNICATING THIS ARTISTIC GIFT TO A MULTITUDE, SO THEY CAN SEE THEMSELVES SURROUNDED BY SUCH A HOST OF SPIRITS WHILE KNOWING THEMSELVES TO BE ESSENTIALLY ONE WITH THEM. THIS PROCESS OF THE TRAGIC CHORUS IS THE DRAMATIC PROTO-PHENOMENON: TO SEE ONESELF TRANSFORMED BEFORE ONE‚ÄÔS OWN EYES AND TO BEGIN TO ACT AS IF ONE HAD ACTUALLY ENTERED INTO ANOTHER BODY, ANOTHER CHARACTER. THIS PROCESS STANDS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ORIGIN OF DRAMA. HERE WE HAVE SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM THE RHAPSODIST WHO DOES NOT BECOME FUSED WITH HIS IMAGES BUT, LIKE A PAINTER, SEES THEM OUTSIDE HIMSELF AS OBJECTS OF CONTEMPLATION. HERE WE HAVE A SURRENDER OF INDIVIDUALITY AND A WAY OF ENTERING INTO ANOTHER CHARACTER. AND THIS PHENOMENON IS ENCOUNTERED EPIDEMICALLY: A WHOLE THRONG EXPERIENCES THE MAGIC OF THIS TRANSFORMATION.THE DITHYRAMB IS THUS ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER CHORAL ODES. THE VIRGINS WHO PROCEED SOLEMNLY TO THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO, LAUREL BRANCHES IN THEIR HANDS, SINGING A PROCESSIONAL HYMN, REMAIN WHAT THEY ARE AND RETAIN THEIR CIVIC NAMES: THE DITHYRAMBIC CHORUS IS A CHORUS OF TRANSFORMED CHARACTERS WHOSE CIVIC PAST AND SOCIAL STATUS HAVE BEEN TOTALLY FORGOTTEN: THEY HAVE BECOME TIMELESS SERVANTS OF THEIR GOD WHO LIVE OUTSIDE THE SPHERES OF SOCIETY. ALL THE OTHER CHORAL LYRIC POETRY OF THE HELLENES IS MERELY A TREMENDOUS INTENSIFICATION OF THE APOLLINIAN SOLO SINGER, WHILE IN THE DITHYRAMB WE CONFRONT A COMMUNITY OF UNCONSCIOUS ACTORS WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES AND ONE ANOTHER TRANSFORMED.SUCH MAGIC TRANSFORMATION IS THE PRESUPPOSITION OF ALL DRAMATIC ART. IN THIS MAGIC TRANSFORMATION THE DIONYSIAN REVELER SEES HIMSELF AS A SATYR, AND AS A SATYR, IN TURN, HE SEES THE GOD, WHICH MEANS THAT IN HIS METAMORPHOSIS HE BEHOLDS ANOTHER VISION OUTSIDE HIMSELF, AS THE APOLLINIAN COMPLEMENT OF HIS OWN STATE. WITH THIS NEW VISION THE DRAMA IS COMPLETE.IN THE LIGHT OF THIS INSIGHT WE MUST UNDERSTAND GREEK TRAGEDY AS THE DIONYSIAN CHORUS WHICH EVER ANEW DISCHARGES ITSELF IN AN APOLLINIAN WORLD OF IMAGES. THUS THE CHORAL PARTS WITH WHICH TRAGEDY IS INTERLACED ARE, AS IT WERE, THE WOMB THAT GAVE BIRTH TO THE WHOLE OF THE SO-CALLED DIALOGUE, THAT IS, THE ENTIRE WORLD OF THE STAGE, THE REAL DRAMA. IN SEVERAL SUCCESSIVE DISCHARGES THIS PRIMAL GROUND OF TRAGEDY RADIATES THIS VISION OF THE DRAMA WHICH IS BY ALL MEANS A DREAM APPARITION AND TO THAT EXTENT EPIC IN NATURE; BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, BEING THE OBJECTIFICATION OF A DIONYSIAN STATE, IT REPRESENTS NOT APOLLINIAN REDEMPTION THROUGH MERE APPEARANCE BUT, ON THE CONTRARY, THE SHATTERING OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND HIS FUSION WITH PRIMAL BEING. THUS THE DRAMA IS THE DIONYSIAN EMBODIMENT OF DIONYSIAN INSIGHTS AND EFFECTS AND THEREBY SEPARATED, AS BY A TREMENDOUS CHASM, FROM THE EPIC.THE CHORUS OF THE GREEK TRAGEDY, THE SYMBOL OF THE WHOLE EXCITED DIONYSIAN THRONG, IS THUS FULLY EXPLAINED BY OUR CONCEPTION. ACCUSTOMED AS WE ARE TO THE FUNCTION OF OUR MODERN STAGE CHORUS, ESPECIALLY IN OPERAS, WE COULD NOT COMPREHEND WHY THE TRAGIC CHORUS OF THE GREEKS SHOULD BE OLDER, MORE ORIGINAL AND IMPORTANT THAN THE ‚ÄÚACTION‚ÄÙ PROPER, AS THE VOICE OF TRADITION CLAIMED UNMISTAKABLY. AND WITH THIS TRADITIONAL PRIMACY AND ORIGINALITY WE COULD NOT RECONCILE THE FACT THAT THE CHORUS CONSISTED ONLY OF HUMBLE BEINGS WHO SERVED‚ÄÎINDEED, INITIALLY ONLY OF GOATLIKE SATYRS. FINALLY, THERE REMAINED THE RIDDLE OF THE ORCHESTRA IN FRONT OF THE SCENE. BUT NOW WE REALIZE THAT THE SCENE, COMPLETE WITH THE ACTION, WAS BASICALLY AND ORIGINALLY THOUGHT OF MERELY AS A VISION; THE CHORUS IS THE ONLY ‚ÄÚREALITY‚ÄÙ AND GENERATES THE VISION, SPEAKING OF IT WITH THE ENTIRE SYMBOLISM OF DANCE, TONE, AND WORDS. IN ITS VISION THIS CHORUS BEHOLDS ITS LORD AND MASTER DIONYSUS AND IS THEREFORE ETERNALLY THE SERVING CHORUS: IT SEES HOW THE GOD SUFFERS AND GLORIFIES HIMSELF AND THEREFORE DOES NOT ITSELF ACT. BUT WHILE ITS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE GOD IS WHOLLY ONE OF SERVICE, IT IS NEVERTHELESS THE HIGHEST, NAMELY THE DIONYSIAN, EXPRESSION OF NATURE AND THEREFORE PRONOUNCES IN ITS RAPTURE, AS NATURE DOES, ORACLES AND WISE SAYINGS: SHARING HIS SUFFERING IT ALSO SHARES SOMETHING OF HIS WISDOM AND PROCLAIMS THE TRUTH FROM THE HEART OF THE WORLD. THAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THE FANTASTIC AND SEEMINGLY SO OFFENSIVE FIGURE OF THE WISE AND RAPTUROUS SATYR WHO IS AT THE SAME TIME ‚ÄÚTHE SIMPLE MAN‚ÄÙ AS OPPOSED TO THE GOD‚ÄÎTHE IMAGE OF NATURE AND ITS STRONGEST URGES, EVEN THEIR SYMBOL, AND AT THE SAME TIME THE PROCLAIMER OF HER WISDOM AND ART‚ÄÎMUSICIAN, POET, DANCER, AND SEER OF SPIRITS IN ONE PERSON.DIONYSUS, THE REAL STAGE HERO AND CENTER OF THE VISION, WAS, ACCORDING BOTH TO THIS INSIGHT AND TO THE TRADITION, NOT ACTUALLY PRESENT AT FIRST, IN THE VERY OLDEST PERIOD OF TRAGEDY; HE WAS MERELY IMAGINED AS PRESENT, WHICH MEANS THAT ORIGINALLY TRAGEDY WAS ONLY ‚ÄÚCHORUS‚ÄÙ AND NOT YET ‚ÄÚDRAMA.‚ÄÙ LATER THE ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO SHOW THE GOD AS REAL AND TO REPRESENT THE VISIONARY FIGURE TOGETHER WITH ITS TRANSFIGURING FRAME AS SOMETHING VISIBLE FOR EVERY EYE‚ÄÎAND THUS ‚ÄÚDRAMA‚ÄÙ IN THE NARROWER SENSE BEGAN. NOW THE DITHYRAMBIC CHORUS WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF EXCITING THE MOOD OF THE LISTENERS TO SUCH A DIONYSIAN DEGREE THAT, WHEN THE TRAGIC HERO APPEARED ON THE STAGE, THEY DID NOT SEE THE AWKWARDLY MASKED HUMAN BEING BUT RATHER A VISIONARY FIGURE, BORN AS IT WERE FROM THEIR OWN RAPTURE.CONSIDER ADMETUS AS HE IS BROODING OVER THE MEMORY OF HIS RECENTLY DEPARTED WIFE ALCESTIS, CONSUMING HIMSELF IN HER SPIRITUAL CONTEMPLATION, WHEN SUDDENLY A SIMILARLY FORMED, SIMILARLY WALKING WOMAN‚ÄÔS FIGURE IS LED TOWARD HIM, HEAVILY VEILED; LET US IMAGINE HIS SUDDEN TREMBLING UNREST, HIS TEMPESTUOUS COMPARISONS, HIS INSTINCTIVE CONVICTION‚ÄÎAND WE HAVE AN ANALOGY WITH WHAT THE SPECTATOR FELT IN HIS DIONYSIAN EXCITEMENT WHEN HE SAW THE APPROACH ON THE STAGE OF THE GOD WITH WHOSE SUFFERINGS HE HAD ALREADY IDENTIFIED HIMSELF. INVOLUNTARILY, HE TRANSFERRED THE WHOLE MAGIC IMAGE OF THE GOD THAT WAS TREMBLING BEFORE HIS SOUL TO THAT MASKED FIGURE AND, AS IT WERE, DISSOLVED ITS REALITY INTO THE UNREALITY OF SPIRITS.THIS IS THE APOLLINIAN STATE OF DREAMS IN WHICH THE WORLD OF THE DAY BECOMES VEILED, AND A NEW WORLD, CLEARER, MORE UNDERSTANDABLE, MORE MOVING THAN THE EVERYDAY WORLD AND YET MORE SHADOWY, PRESENTS ITSELF TO OUR EYES IN CONTINUAL REBIRTHS. ACCORDINGLY, WE RECOGNIZE IN TRAGEDY A SWEEPING OPPOSITION OF STYLES: THE LANGUAGE, COLOR, MOBILITY, AND DYNAMICS OF SPEECH FALL APART INTO THE DIONYSIAN LYRICS OF THE CHORUS AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE APOLLINIAN DREAM WORLD, AND BECOME TWO UTTERLY DIFFERENT SPHERES OF EXPRESSION. THE APOLLINIAN APPEARANCES IN WHICH DIONYSUS OBJECTIFIES HIMSELF ARE NO LONGER ‚ÄÚAN ETERNAL SEA, CHANGEFUL STRIFE, A GLOWING LIFE,‚ÄÙ7 LIKE THE MUSIC OF THE CHORUS, NO LONGER THOSE FORCES, MERELY FELT AND NOT CONDENSED INTO IMAGES, IN WHICH THE ENRAPTURED SERVANT OF DIONYSUS SENSES THE NEARNESS OF THE GOD: NOW THE CLARITY AND FIRMNESS OF EPIC FORM ADDRESSES HIM FROM THE SCENE; NOW DIONYSUS NO LONGER SPEAKS THROUGH FORCES BUT AS AN EPIC HERO, ALMOST IN THE LANGUAGE OF HOMER.EVERYTHING THAT COMES TO THE SURFACE IN THE APOLLINIAN PART OF GREEK TRAGEDY, IN THE DIALOGUE, LOOKS SIMPLE, TRANSPARENT, AND BEAUTIFUL. IN THIS SENSE, THE DIALOGUE IS AN IMAGE OF THE HELLENE WHOSE NATURE IS REVEALED IN THE DANCE BECAUSE IN THE DANCE THE GREATEST STRENGTH REMAINS ONLY POTENTIAL BUT BETRAYS ITSELF IN THE SUPPLENESS AND WEALTH OF MOVEMENT. THUS THE LANGUAGE OF SOPHOCLES‚ÄÔ HEROES AMAZES US BY ITS APOLLINIAN PRECISION AND LUCIDITY, SO WE IMMEDIATELY HAVE THE FEELING THAT WE ARE LOOKING INTO THE INNERMOST GROUND OF THEIR BEING, WITH SOME ASTONISHMENT THAT THE WAY TO THIS GROUND SHOULD BE SO SHORT. BUT SUPPOSE WE DISREGARD THE CHARACTER OF THE HERO AS IT COMES TO THE SURFACE, VISIBLY‚ÄÎAFTER ALL, IT IS IN THE LAST ANALYSIS NOTHING BUT A BRIGHT IMAGE PROJECTED ON A DARK WALL, WHICH MEANS APPEARANCE1 THROUGH AND THROUGH; SUPPOSE WE PENETRATE INTO THE MYTH THAT PROJECTS ITSELF IN THESE LUCID REFLECTIONS: THEN WE SUDDENLY EXPERIENCE A PHENOMENON THAT IS JUST THE OPPOSITE OF A FAMILIAR OPTICAL PHENOMENON. WHEN AFTER A FORCEFUL ATTEMPT TO GAZE ON THE SUN WE TURN AWAY BLINDED, WE SEE DARK-COLORED SPOTS BEFORE OUR EYES, AS A CURE, AS IT WERE. CONVERSELY, THE BRIGHT IMAGE PROJECTIONS OF THE SOPHOCLEAN HERO‚ÄÎIN SHORT, THE APOLLINIAN ASPECT OF THE MASK‚ÄÎARE NECESSARY EFFECTS OF A GLANCE INTO THE INSIDE AND TERRORS OF NATURE; AS IT WERE, LUMINOUS SPOTS TO CURE EYES DAMAGED BY GRUESOME NIGHT. ONLY IN THIS SENSE MAY WE BELIEVE THAT WE PROPERLY COMPREHEND THE SERIOUS AND IMPORTANT CONCEPT OF ‚ÄÚGREEK CHEERFULNESS.‚ÄÙ THE MISUNDERSTANDING OF THIS CONCEPT AS CHEERFULNESS IN A STATE OF UNENDANGERED COMFORT IS, OF COURSE, ENCOUNTERED EVERYWHERE TODAY.SOPHOCLES UNDERSTOOD THE MOST SORROWFUL FIGURE OF THE GREEK STAGE, THE UNFORTUNATE OEDIPUS, AS THE NOBLE HUMAN BEING WHO, IN SPITE OF HIS WISDOM, IS DESTINED TO ERROR AND MISERY BUT WHO EVENTUALLY, THROUGH HIS TREMENDOUS SUFFERING, SPREADS A MAGICAL POWER OF BLESSING THAT REMAINS EFFECTIVE EVEN BEYOND HIS DECEASE. THE NOBLE HUMAN BEING DOES NOT SIN, THE PROFOUND POET WANTS TO TELL US: THOUGH EVERY LAW, EVERY NATURAL ORDER, EVEN THE MORAL WORLD MAY PERISH THROUGH HIS ACTIONS, HIS ACTIONS ALSO PRODUCE A HIGHER MAGICAL CIRCLE OF EFFECTS WHICH FOUND A NEW WORLD ON THE RUINS OF THE OLD ONE THAT HAS BEEN OVERTHROWN. THAT IS WHAT THE POET WANTS TO SAY TO US INSOFAR AS HE IS AT THE SAME TIME A RELIGIOUS THINKER. AS A POET HE FIRST SHOWS US A MARVELOUSLY TIED KNOT OF A TRIAL, SLOWLY UNRAVELED BY THE JUDGE, BIT BY BIT, FOR HIS OWN UNDOING. THE GENUINELY HELLENIC DELIGHT AT THIS DIALECTICAL SOLUTION IS SO GREAT THAT IT INTRODUCES A TRAIT OF SUPERIOR CHEERFULNESS INTO THE WHOLE WORK, EVERYWHERE SOFTENING THE SHARP POINTS OF THE GRUESOME PRESUPPOSITIONS OF THIS PROCESS.IN OEDIPUS AT COLONUS WE ENCOUNTER THE SAME CHEERFULNESS, BUT ELEVATED INTO AN INFINITE TRANSFIGURATION. THE OLD MAN, STRUCK BY AN EXCESS OF MISERY, ABANDONED SOLELY TO SUFFER WHATEVER BEFALLS HIM, IS CONFRONTED BY THE SUPRATERRESTRIAL CHEERFULNESS THAT DESCENDS FROM THE DIVINE SPHERE AND SUGGESTS TO US THAT THE HERO ATTAINS HIS HIGHEST ACTIVITY, EXTENDING FAR BEYOND HIS LIFE, THROUGH HIS PURELY PASSIVE POSTURE, WHILE HIS CONSCIOUS DEEDS AND DESIRES, EARLIER IN HIS LIFE, MERELY LED HIM INTO PASSIVITY. THUS THE INTRICATE LEGAL KNOT OF THE OEDIPUS FABLE THAT NO MORTAL EYE COULD UNRAVEL IS GRADUALLY DISENTANGLED‚ÄÎAND THE MOST PROFOUND HUMAN JOY OVERCOMES US AT THIS DIVINE COUNTERPART OF THE DIALECTIC.IF THIS EXPLANATION DOES JUSTICE TO THE POET ONE MAY YET ASK WHETHER IT EXHAUSTS THE CONTENTS OF THE MYTH‚ÄÎAND THEN IT BECOMES EVIDENT THAT THE POET‚ÄÔS WHOLE CONCEPTION IS NOTHING BUT PRECISELY THAT BRIGHT IMAGE WHICH HEALING NATURE PROJECTS BEFORE US AFTER A GLANCE INTO THE ABYSS. OEDIPUS, THE MURDERER OF HIS FATHER, THE HUSBAND OF HIS MOTHER, THE SOLVER OF THE RIDDLE OF THE SPHINX! WHAT DOES THE MYSTERIOUS TRIAD OF THESE FATEFUL DEEDS TELL US?THERE IS A TREMENDOUSLY OLD POPULAR BELIEF, ESPECIALLY IN PERSIA, THAT A WISE MAGUS CAN BE BORN ONLY FROM INCEST. WITH THE RIDDLE-SOLVING AND MOTHER-MARRYING OEDIPUS IN MIND, WE MUST IMMEDIATELY INTERPRET THIS TO MEAN THAT WHERE PROPHETIC AND MAGICAL POWERS HAVE BROKEN THE SPELL OF PRESENT AND FUTURE, THE RIGID LAW OF INDIVIDUATION, AND THE REAL MAGIC OF NATURE, SOME ENORMOUSLY UNNATURAL EVENT‚ÄÎSUCH AS INCEST‚ÄÎMUST HAVE OCCURRED EARLIER, AS A CAUSE. HOW ELSE COULD ONE COMPEL NATURE TO SURRENDER HER SECRETS IF NOT BY TRIUMPHANTLY RESISTING HER, THAT IS, BY MEANS OF SOMETHING UNNATURAL? IT IS THIS INSIGHT THAT I FIND EXPRESSED IN THAT HORRIBLE TRIAD OF OEDIPUS‚ÄÔ DESTINIES: THE SAME MAN WHO SOLVES THE RIDDLE OF NATURE‚ÄÎTHAT SPHINX OF TWO SPECIES2‚ÄÎALSO MUST BREAK THE MOST SACRED NATURAL ORDERS BY MURDERING HIS FATHER AND MARRYING HIS MOTHER. INDEED, THE MYTH SEEMS TO WISH TO WHISPER TO US THAT WISDOM, AND PARTICULARLY DIONYSIAN WISDOM, IS AN UNNATURAL ABOMINATION; THAT HE WHO BY MEANS OF HIS KNOWLEDGE PLUNGES NATURE INTO THE ABYSS OF DESTRUCTION MUST ALSO SUFFER THE DISSOLUTION OF NATURE IN HIS OWN PERSON. ‚ÄÚTHE EDGE OF WISDOM TURNS AGAINST THE WISE: WISDOM IS A CRIME AGAINST NATURE‚ÄÙ: SUCH HORRIBLE SENTENCES ARE PROCLAIMED TO US BY THE MYTH; BUT THE HELLENIC POET TOUCHES THE SUBLIME AND TERRIBLE MEMNON‚ÄÔS COLUMN OF MYTH LIKE A SUNBEAM, SO THAT IT SUDDENLY BEGINS TO SOUND‚ÄÎIN SOPHOCLEAN MELODIES.LET ME NOW CONTRAST THE GLORY OF ACTIVITY, WHICH ILLUMINATES AESCHYLUS‚ÄÔ PROMETHEUS, WITH THE GLORY OF PASSIVITY. WHAT THE THINKER AESCHYLUS HAD TO SAY TO US HERE, BUT WHAT AS A POET HE ONLY ALLOWS US TO SENSE IN HIS SYMBOLIC IMAGE, THE YOUTHFUL GOETHE WAS ABLE TO REVEAL TO US IN THE AUDACIOUS WORDS OF HIS PROMETHEUS:HERE I SIT, FORMING MEN IN MY OWN IMAGE, A RACE TO BE LIKE ME, TO SUFFER, TO WEEP, TO DELIGHT AND TO REJOICE, AND TO DEFY YOU, AS I DO.MAN, RISING TO TITANIC STATURE, GAINS CULTURE BY HIS OWN EFFORTS AND FORCES THE GODS TO ENTER INTO AN ALLIANCE WITH HIM BECAUSE IN HIS VERY OWN WISDOM HE HOLDS THEIR EXISTENCE AND THEIR LIMITATIONS IN HIS HANDS. BUT WHAT IS MOST WONDERFUL IN THIS PROMETHEUS POEM, WHICH IN ITS BASIC IDEA IS THE VERITABLE HYMN OF IMPIETY, IS THE PROFOUNDLY AESCHYLEAN DEMAND FOR JUSTICE. THE IMMEASURABLE SUFFERING OF THE BOLD ‚ÄÚINDIVIDUAL‚ÄÙ ON THE ONE HAND AND THE DIVINE PREDICAMENT AND INTIMATION OF A TWILIGHT OF THE GODS ON THE OTHER, THE WAY THE POWER OF THESE TWO WORLDS OF SUFFERING COMPELS A RECONCILIATION, A METAPHYSICAL UNION‚ÄÎALL THIS RECALLS IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE MANNER THE CENTER AND MAIN AXIOM OF THE AESCHYLEAN VIEW OF THE WORLD WHICH ENVISAGES MOIRA ENTHRONED ABOVE GODS AND MEN AS ETERNAL JUSTICE.IN VIEW OF THE ASTONISHING AUDACITY WITH WHICH AESCHYLUS PLACES THE OLYMPIAN WORLD ON THE SCALES OF HIS JUSTICE, WE MUST CALL TO MIND THAT THE PROFOUND GREEK POSSESSED AN IMMOVABLY FIRM FOUNDATION FOR METAPHYSICAL THOUGHT IN HIS MYSTERIES, AND ALL HIS SKEPTICAL MOODS COULD BE VENTED AGAINST THE OLYMPIANS. THE GREEK ARTIST IN PARTICULAR HAD AN OBSCURE FEELING OF MUTUAL DEPENDENCE WHEN IT CAME TO THE GODS; AND PRECISELY IN THE PROMETHEUS OF AESCHYLUS THIS FEELING IS SYMBOLIZED. IN HIMSELF THE TITANIC ARTIST FOUND THE DEFIANT FAITH THAT HE HAD THE ABILITY TO CREATE MEN AND AT LEAST DESTROY OLYMPIAN GODS, BY MEANS OF HIS SUPERIOR WISDOM WHICH, TO BE SURE, HE HAD TO ATONE FOR WITH ETERNAL SUFFERING. THE SPLENDID ‚ÄÚABILITY‚ÄÙ OF THE GREAT GENIUS FOR WHICH EVEN ETERNAL SUFFERING IS A SLIGHT PRICE, THE STERN PRIDE OF THE ARTIST‚ÄÎTHAT IS THE CONTENT AND SOUL OF AESCHYLUS‚ÄÔ POEM, WHILE SOPHOCLES IN HIS OEDIPUS SOUNDS AS A PRELUDE THE HOLY MAN‚ÄÔS SONG OF TRIUMPH.BUT AESCHYLUS‚ÄÔ INTERPRETATION OF THE MYTH DOES NOT EXHAUST THE ASTOUNDING DEPTH OF ITS TERROR. RATHER THE ARTIST‚ÄÔS DELIGHT IN WHAT BECOMES, THE CHEERFULNESS OF ARTISTIC CREATION THAT DEFIES ALL MISFORTUNE, IS MERELY A BRIGHT IMAGE OF CLOUDS AND SKY MIRRORED IN A BLACK LAKE OF SADNESS. THE PROMETHEUS STORY IS AN ORIGINAL POSSESSION OF THE ENTIRE ARYAN COMMUNITY OF PEOPLES AND EVIDENCES THEIR GIFT FOR THE PROFOUNDLY TRAGIC. INDEED, IT DOES NOT SEEM IMPROBABLE THAT THIS MYTH HAS THE SAME CHARACTERISTIC SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE ARYAN CHARACTER WHICH THE MYTH OF THE FALL HAS FOR THE SEMITIC CHARACTER, AND THAT THESE TWO MYTHS ARE RELATED TO EACH OTHER LIKE BROTHER AND SISTER.5 THE PRESUPPOSITION OF THE PROMETHEUS MYTH IS TO BE FOUND IN THE EXTRAVAGANT VALUE WHICH A NA√ØVE HUMANITY ATTACHED TO FIRE AS THE TRUE PALLADIUM OF EVERY ASCENDING CULTURE. BUT THAT MAN SHOULD FREELY DISPOSE OF FIRE WITHOUT RECEIVING IT AS A PRESENT FROM HEAVEN, EITHER AS A LIGHTNING BOLT OR AS THE WARMING RAYS OF THE SUN, STRUCK THESE REFLECTIVE PRIMITIVE MEN AS SACRILEGE, AS A ROBBERY OF DIVINE NATURE. THUS THE VERY FIRST PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY PRODUCES A PAINFUL AND IRRESOLVABLE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN MAN AND GOD AND MOVES IT BEFORE THE GATE OF EVERY CULTURE, LIKE A HUGE BOULDER. THE BEST AND HIGHEST POSSESSION MANKIND CAN ACQUIRE IS OBTAINED BY SACRILEGE AND MUST BE PAID FOR WITH CONSEQUENCES THAT INVOLVE THE WHOLE FLOOD OF SUFFERINGS AND SORROWS WITH WHICH THE OFFENDED DIVINITIES HAVE TO AFFLICT THE NOBLY ASPIRING RACE OF MEN. THIS IS A HARSH IDEA WHICH, BY THE DIGNITY IT CONFERS ON SACRILEGE, CONTRASTS STRANGELY WITH THE SEMITIC MYTH OF THE FALL IN WHICH CURIOSITY, MENDACIOUS DECEPTION, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SEDUCTION, LUST‚ÄÎIN SHORT, A SERIES OF PRE-EMINENTLY FEMININE AFFECTS WAS CONSIDERED THE ORIGIN OF EVIL. WHAT DISTINGUISHES THE ARYAN NOTION IS THE SUBLIME VIEW OF ACTIVE SIN AS THE CHARACTERISTICALLY PROMETHEAN VIRTUE. WITH THAT, THE ETHICAL BASIS FOR PESSIMISTIC TRAGEDY HAS BEEN FOUND: THE JUSTIFICATION OF HUMAN EVIL, MEANING BOTH HUMAN GUILT AND THE HUMAN SUFFERING IT ENTAILS. THE MISFORTUNE IN THE NATURE OF THINGS, WHICH THE CONTEMPLATIVE ARYAN IS NOT INCLINED TO INTERPRET AWAY‚ÄÎTHE CONTRADICTION AT THE HEART OF THE WORLD REVEALS ITSELF TO HIM AS A CLASH OF DIFFERENT WORLDS, E.G., OF A DIVINE AND HUMAN ONE, IN WHICH EACH, TAKEN AS AN INDIVIDUAL, HAS RIGHT ON ITS SIDE, BUT NEVERTHELESS HAS TO SUFFER FOR ITS INDIVIDUATION, BEING MERELY A SINGLE ONE BESIDE ANOTHER. IN THE HEROIC EFFORT OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO ATTAIN UNIVERSALITY, IN THE ATTEMPT TO TRANSCEND THE CURSE OF INDIVIDUATION AND TO BECOME THE ONE WORLD-BEING, HE SUFFERS IN HIS OWN PERSON THE PRIMORDIAL CONTRADICTION THAT IS CONCEALED IN THINGS, WHICH MEANS THAT HE COMMITS SACRILEGE AND SUFFERS.THUS THE ARYANS UNDERSTAND SACRILEGE AS SOMETHING MASCULINE,6 WHILE THE SEMITES UNDERSTAND SIN AS FEMININE,7 JUST AS THE ORIGINAL SACRILEGE IS COMMITTED BY A MAN, THE ORIGINAL SIN BY A WOMAN. ALSO, THE WITCHES‚ÄÔ CHORUS SAYS:IF THAT IS SO, WE DO NOT MIND IT:WITH A THOUSAND STEPS THE WOMEN FIND IT;BUT THOUGH THEY RUSH, WE DO NOT CARE:WITH ONE BIG JUMP THE MEN GET THERE.WHOEVER UNDERSTANDS THIS INNERMOST KERNEL OF THE PROMETHEUS STORY‚ÄÎNAMELY, THE NECESSITY OF SACRILEGE IMPOSED UPON THE TITANICALLY STRIVING INDIVIDUAL‚ÄÎMUST ALSO IMMEDIATELY FEEL HOW UN-APOLLINIAN THIS PESSIMISTIC NOTION IS. FOR APOLLO WANTS TO GRANT REPOSE TO INDIVIDUAL BEINGS PRECISELY BY DRAWING BOUNDARIES BETWEEN THEM AND BY AGAIN AND AGAIN CALLING THESE TO MIND AS THE MOST SACRED LAWS OF THE WORLD, WITH HIS DEMANDS FOR SELF-KNOWLEDGE AND MEASURE.LEST THIS APOLLINIAN TENDENCY CONGEAL THE FORM TO EGYPTIAN RIGIDITY AND COLDNESS, LEST THE EFFORT TO PRESCRIBE TO THE INDIVIDUAL WAVE ITS PATH AND REALM MIGHT ANNUL THE MOTION OF THE WHOLE LAKE, THE HIGH TIDE OF THE DIONYSIAN DESTROYED FROM TIME TO TIME ALL THOSE LITTLE CIRCLES IN WHICH THE ONE-SIDEDLY APOLLINIAN ‚ÄÚWILL‚ÄÙ HAD SOUGHT TO CONFINE THE HELLENIC SPIRIT. THE SUDDENLY SWELLING DIONYSIAN TIDE THEN TAKES THE SEPARATE LITTLE WAVE-MOUNTAINS OF INDIVIDUALS ON ITS BACK, EVEN AS PROMETHEUS‚ÄÔ BROTHER, THE TITAN ATLAS, DOES WITH THE EARTH. THIS TITANIC IMPULSE TO BECOME, AS IT WERE, THE ATLAS FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS, CARRYING THEM ON A BROAD BACK, HIGHER AND HIGHER, FARTHER AND FARTHER, IS WHAT THE PROMETHEAN AND THE DIONYSIAN HAVE IN COMMON.IN THIS RESPECT, THE PROMETHEUS OF AESCHYLUS IS A DIONYSIAN MASK, WHILE IN THE AFOREMENTIONED PROFOUND DEMAND FOR JUSTICE AESCHYLUS REVEALS TO THE THOUGHTFUL HIS PATERNAL DESCENT FROM APOLLO, THE GOD OF INDIVIDUATION AND OF JUST BOUNDARIES. SO THE DUAL NATURE OF AESCHYLUS‚ÄÔ PROMETHEUS, HIS NATURE WHICH IS AT THE SAME TIME DIONYSIAN AND APOLLINIAN, MIGHT BE EXPRESSED THUS IN A CONCEPTUAL FORMULA: ‚ÄÚALL THAT EXISTS IS JUST AND UNJUST AND EQUALLY JUSTIFIED IN BOTH.‚ÄÙTHAT IS YOUR WORLD! A WORLD INDEED!THE TRADITION IS UNDISPUTED THAT GREEK TRAGEDY IN ITS EARLIEST FORM HAD FOR ITS SOLE THEME THE SUFFERINGS OF DIONYSUS AND THAT FOR A LONG TIME THE ONLY STAGE HERO WAS DIONYSUS HIMSELF. BUT IT MAY BE CLAIMED WITH EQUAL CONFIDENCE THAT UNTIL EURIPIDES, DIONYSUS NEVER CEASED TO BE THE TRAGIC HERO; THAT ALL THE CELEBRATED FIGURES OF THE GREEK STAGE‚ÄÎPROMETHEUS, OEDIPUS, ETC.‚ÄÎARE MERE MASKS OF THIS ORIGINAL HERO, DIONYSUS. THAT BEHIND ALL THESE MASKS THERE IS A DEITY, THAT IS ONE ESSENTIAL REASON FOR THE TYPICAL ‚ÄÚIDEALITY‚ÄÙ OF THESE FAMOUS FIGURES WHICH HAS CAUSED SO MUCH ASTONISHMENT. SOMEBODY, I DO NOT KNOW WHO, HAS CLAIMED THAT ALL INDIVIDUALS, TAKEN AS INDIVIDUALS, ARE COMIC AND HENCE UNTRAGIC‚ÄÎFROM WHICH IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT THE GREEKS SIMPLY COULD NOT SUFFER INDIVIDUALS ON THE TRAGIC STAGE. IN FACT, THIS IS WHAT THEY SEEM TO HAVE FELT; AND THE PLATONIC DISTINCTION AND EVALUATION OF THE ‚ÄÚIDEA‚ÄÙ AND THE ‚ÄÚIDOL,‚ÄÙ THE MERE IMAGE, IS VERY DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE HELLENIC CHARACTER.USING PLATO‚ÄÔS TERMS WE SHOULD HAVE TO SPEAK OF THE TRAGIC FIGURES OF THE HELLENIC STAGE SOMEWHAT AS FOLLOWS: THE ONE TRULY REAL DIONYSUS APPEARS IN A VARIETY OF FORMS, IN THE MASK OF A FIGHTING HERO, AND ENTANGLED, AS IT WERE, IN THE NET OF THE INDIVIDUAL WILL. THE GOD WHO APPEARS TALKS AND ACTS SO AS TO RESEMBLE AN ERRING, STRIVING, SUFFERING INDIVIDUAL. THAT HE APPEARS AT ALL WITH SUCH EPIC PRECISION AND CLARITY IS THE WORK OF THE DREAM-INTERPRETER, APOLLO, WHO THROUGH THIS SYMBOLIC APPEARANCE INTERPRETS TO THE CHORUS ITS DIONYSIAN STATE. IN TRUTH, HOWEVER, THE HERO IS THE SUFFERING DIONYSUS OF THE MYSTERIES, THE GOD EXPERIENCING IN HIMSELF THE AGONIES OF INDIVIDUATION, OF WHOM WONDERFUL MYTHS TELL THAT AS A BOY HE WAS TORN TO PIECES BY THE TITANS AND NOW IS WORSHIPED IN THIS STATE AS ZAGREUS. THUS IT IS INTIMATED THAT THIS DISMEMBERMENT, THE PROPERLY DIONYSIAN SUFFERING, IS LIKE A TRANSFORMATION INTO AIR, WATER, EARTH, AND FIRE, THAT WE ARE THEREFORE TO REGARD THE STATE OF INDIVIDUATION AS THE ORIGIN AND PRIMAL CAUSE OF ALL SUFFERING, AS SOMETHING OBJECTIONABLE IN ITSELF. FROM THE SMILE OF THIS DIONYSUS SPRANG THE OLYMPIAN GODS, FROM HIS TEARS SPRANG MAN. IN THIS EXISTENCE AS A DISMEMBERED GOD, DIONYSUS POSSESSES THE DUAL NATURE OF A CRUEL, BARBARIZED DEMON AND A MILD, GENTLE RULER. BUT THE HOPE OF THE EPOPTS1 LOOKED TOWARD A REBIRTH OF DIONYSUS, WHICH WE MUST NOW DIMLY CONCEIVE AS THE END OF INDIVIDUATION. IT WAS FOR THIS COMING THIRD DIONYSUS THAT THE EPOPTS‚ÄÔ ROARING HYMNS OF JOY RESOUNDED. AND IT IS THIS HOPE ALONE THAT CASTS A GLEAM OF JOY UPON THE FEATURES OF A WORLD TORN ASUNDER AND SHATTERED INTO INDIVIDUALS; THIS IS SYMBOLIZED IN THE MYTH OF DEMETER, SUNK IN ETERNAL SORROW, WHO REJOICES AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN TOLD THAT SHE MAY ONCE MORE GIVE BIRTH TO DIONYSUS. THIS VIEW OF THINGS ALREADY PROVIDES US WITH ALL THE ELEMENTS OF A PROFOUND AND PESSIMISTIC VIEW OF THE WORLD, TOGETHER WITH THE MYSTERY DOCTRINE OF TRAGEDY: THE FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE ONENESS OF EVERYTHING EXISTENT, THE CONCEPTION OF INDIVIDUATION AS THE PRIMAL CAUSE OF EVIL, AND OF ART AS THE JOYOUS HOPE THAT THE SPELL OF INDIVIDUATION MAY BE BROKEN IN AUGURY OF A RESTORED ONENESS.WE HAVE ALREADY SUGGESTED THAT THE HOMERIC EPOS IS THE POEM OF OLYMPIAN CULTURE, IN WHICH THIS CULTURE HAS SUNG ITS OWN SONG OF VICTORY OVER THE TERRORS OF THE WAR OF THE TITANS. UNDER THE PREDOMINATING INFLUENCE OF TRAGIC POETRY, THESE HOMERIC MYTHS ARE NOW BORN ANEW; AND THIS METEMPSYCHOSIS REVEALS THAT IN THE MEANTIME THE OLYMPIAN CULTURE ALSO HAS BEEN CONQUERED BY A STILL MORE PROFOUND VIEW OF THE WORLD. THE DEFIANT TITAN PROMETHEUS HAS ANNOUNCED TO HIS OLYMPIAN TORMENTOR THAT SOME DAY THE GREATEST DANGER WILL MENACE HIS RULE, UNLESS ZEUS SHOULD ENTER INTO AN ALLIANCE WITH HIM IN TIME. IN AESCHYLUS WE RECOGNIZE HOW THE TERRIFIED ZEUS, FEARFUL OF HIS END, ALLIES HIMSELF WITH THE TITAN. THUS THE FORMER AGE OF THE TITANS IS ONCE MORE RECOVERED FROM TARTARUS AND BROUGHT TO THE LIGHT.THE PHILOSOPHY OF WILD AND NAKED NATURE BEHOLDS WITH THE FRANK, UNDISSEMBLING GAZE OF TRUTH THE MYTHS OF THE HOMERIC WORLD AS THEY DANCE PAST: THEY TURN PALE, THEY TREMBLE UNDER THE PIERCING GLANCE OF THIS GODDESS2‚ÄÎTILL THE POWERFUL FIST OF THE DIONYSIAN ARTIST FORCES THEM INTO THE SERVICE OF THE NEW DEITY. DIONYSIAN TRUTH TAKES OVER THE ENTIRE DOMAIN OF MYTH AS THE SYMBOLISM OF ITS KNOWLEDGE WHICH IT MAKES KNOWN PARTLY IN THE PUBLIC CULT OF TRAGEDY AND PARTLY IN THE SECRET CELEBRATIONS OF DRAMATIC MYSTERIES, BUT ALWAYS IN THE OLD MYTHICAL GARB.WHAT POWER WAS IT THAT FREED PROMETHEUS FROM HIS VULTURES AND TRANSFORMED THE MYTH INTO A VEHICLE OF DIONYSIAN WISDOM? IT IS THE HERACLEIAN POWER OF MUSIC: HAVING REACHED ITS HIGHEST MANIFESTATION IN TRAGEDY, IT CAN INVEST MYTHS WITH A NEW AND MOST PROFOUND SIGNIFICANCE. THIS WE HAVE ALREADY CHARACTERIZED AS THE MOST POWERFUL FUNCTION OF MUSIC. FOR IT IS THE FATE OF EVERY MYTH TO CREEP BY DEGREES INTO THE NARROW LIMITS OF SOME ALLEGED HISTORICAL REALITY, AND TO BE TREATED BY SOME LATER GENERATION AS A UNIQUE FACT WITH HISTORICAL CLAIMS: AND THE GREEKS WERE ALREADY FAIRLY ON THE WAY TOWARD RESTAMPING THE WHOLE OF THEIR MYTHICAL JUVENILE DREAM SAGACIOUSLY AND ARBITRARILY INTO A HISTORICO-PRAGMATICAL JUVENILE HISTORY. FOR THIS IS THE WAY IN WHICH RELIGIONS ARE WONT TO DIE OUT: UNDER THE STERN, INTELLIGENT EYES OF AN ORTHODOX DOGMATISM, THE MYTHICAL PREMISES OF A RELIGION ARE SYSTEMATIZED AS A SUM TOTAL OF HISTORICAL EVENTS; ONE BEGINS APPREHENSIVELY TO DEFEND THE CREDIBILITY OF THE MYTHS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ONE OPPOSES ANY CONTINUATION OF THEIR NATURAL VITALITY AND GROWTH; THE FEELING FOR MYTH PERISHES, AND ITS PLACE IS TAKEN BY THE CLAIM OF RELIGION TO HISTORICAL FOUNDATIONS. THIS DYING MYTH WAS NOW SEIZED BY THE NEW-BORN GENIUS OF DIONYSIAN MUSIC; AND IN THESE HANDS IT FLOURISHED ONCE MORE WITH COLORS SUCH AS IT HAD NEVER YET DISPLAYED, WITH A FRAGRANCE THAT AWAKENED A LONGING ANTICIPATION OF A METAPHYSICAL WORLD. AFTER THIS FINAL EFFULGENCE IT COLLAPSES, ITS LEAVES WITHER, AND SOON THE MOCKING LUCIANS OF ANTIQUITY CATCH AT THE DISCOLORED AND FADED FLOWERS CARRIED AWAY BY THE FOUR WINDS. THROUGH TRAGEDY THE MYTH ATTAINS ITS MOST PROFOUND CONTENT, ITS MOST EXPRESSIVE FORM; IT RISES ONCE MORE LIKE A WOUNDED HERO, AND ITS WHOLE EXCESS OF STRENGTH, TOGETHER WITH THE PHILOSOPHIC CALM OF THE DYING, BURNS IN ITS EYES WITH A LAST POWERFUL GLEAM.WHAT DID YOU WANT, SACRILEGIOUS EURIPIDES, WHEN YOU SOUGHT TO COMPEL THIS DYING MYTH TO SERVE YOU ONCE MORE? IT DIED UNDER YOUR VIOLENT HANDS‚ÄÎAND THEN YOU NEEDED A COPIED, MASKED MYTH THAT, LIKE THE APE OF HERACLES, MERELY KNEW HOW TO DECK ITSELF OUT IN THE ANCIENT POMP. AND JUST AS THE MYTH DIED ON YOU, THE GENIUS OF MUSIC DIED ON YOU, TOO. THOUGH WITH GREEDY HANDS YOU PLUNDERED ALL THE GARDENS OF MUSIC, YOU STILL MANAGED ONLY COPIED, MASKED MUSIC. AND BECAUSE YOU HAD ABANDONED DIONYSUS, APOLLO ABANDONED YOU: ROUSE ALL THE PASSIONS FROM THEIR RESTING PLACES AND CONJURE THEM INTO YOUR CIRCLE, SHARPEN AND WHET A SOPHISTICAL DIALECTIC FOR THE SPEECHES OF YOUR HEROES‚ÄÎYOUR HEROES, TOO, HAVE ONLY COPIED, MASKED PASSIONS AND SPEAK ONLY COPIED, MASKED SPEECHES.GREEK TRAGEDY MET AN END DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF HER OLDER SISTER-ARTS: SHE DIED BY SUICIDE, IN CONSEQUENCE OF AN IRRECONCILABLE CONFLICT; SHE DIED TRAGICALLY, WHILE ALL THE OTHERS PASSED AWAY CALMLY AND BEAUTIFULLY AT A RIPE OLD AGE. IF IT BE CONSONANT WITH A HAPPY NATURAL STATE TO TAKE LEAVE OF LIFE EASILY, LEAVING BEHIND A FAIR POSTERITY, THE CLOSING PERIOD OF THESE OLDER ARTS EXHIBITS SUCH A HAPPY NATURAL STATE: SLOWLY THEY SINK FROM SIGHT, AND BEFORE THEIR DYING EYES STAND THEIR FAIRER PROGENY, WHO LIFT UP THEIR HEADS IMPATIENTLY, WITH A BOLD GESTURE. BUT WHEN GREEK TRAGEDY DIED, THERE ROSE EVERYWHERE THE DEEP SENSE OF AN IMMENSE VOID. JUST AS GREEK SAILORS IN THE TIME OF TIBERIUS ONCE HEARD ON A LONESOME ISLAND THE SOUL-SHAKING CRY, ‚ÄÚGREAT PAN IS DEAD,‚ÄÙ SO THE HELLENIC WORLD WAS NOW PIERCED BY THE GRIEVOUS LAMENT: ‚ÄÚTRAGEDY IS DEAD! POETRY ITSELF HAS PERISHED WITH HER! AWAY WITH YOU, PALE, MEAGER EPIGONES! AWAY TO HADES, THAT YOU MAY FOR ONCE EAT YOUR FILL OF THE CRUMBS OF OUR FORMER MASTERS!‚ÄÙWHEN A NEW ARTISTIC GENRE BLOSSOMED FORTH AFTER ALL, AND REVERED TRAGEDY AS ITS PREDECESSOR AND MISTRESS, IT WAS NOTED WITH HORROR THAT SHE DID INDEED BEAR THE FEATURES OF HER MOTHER‚ÄÎBUT THOSE SHE HAD EXHIBITED IN HER LONG DEATH-STRUGGLE. IT WAS EURIPIDES WHO FOUGHT THIS DEATH STRUGGLE OF TRAGEDY; THE LATER ARTISTIC GENRE IS KNOWN AS NEW ATTIC COMEDY.1 IN IT THE DEGENERATE FORM OF TRAGEDY LIVED ON AS A MONUMENT OF ITS EXCEEDINGLY PAINFUL AND VIOLENT DEATH.THIS CONNECTION HELPS TO EXPLAIN THE PASSIONATE ATTACHMENT THAT THE POETS OF THE NEW COMEDY FELT FOR EURIPIDES; SO THAT WE ARE NO LONGER SURPRISED AT THE WISH OF PHILEMON, WHO WOULD HAVE LET HIMSELF BE HANGED AT ONCE, MERELY THAT HE MIGHT VISIT EURIPIDES IN THE LOWER WORLD‚ÄÎIF ONLY HE COULD BE CERTAIN THAT THE DECEASED STILL HAD POSSESSION OF HIS REASON. BUT IF WE DESIRE, AS BRIEFLY AS POSSIBLE, AND WITHOUT CLAIMING TO SAY ANYTHING EXHAUSTIVE, TO CHARACTERIZE WHAT EURIPIDES HAS IN COMMON WITH MENANDER AND PHILEMON, AND WHAT APPEALED TO THEM SO STRONGLY AS WORTHY OF IMITATION, IT IS SUFFICIENT TO SAY THAT EURIPIDES BROUGHT THE SPECTATOR ONTO THE STAGE. HE WHO HAS PERCEIVED THE MATERIAL OUT OF WHICH THE PROMETHEAN TRAGIC WRITERS PRIOR TO EURIPIDES FORMED THEIR HEROES, AND HOW REMOTE FROM THEIR PURPOSE IT WAS TO BRING THE FAITHFUL MASK OF REALITY ONTO THE STAGE, WILL ALSO BE AWARE OF THE UTTERLY OPPOSITE TENDENCY OF EURIPIDES. THROUGH HIM THE EVERYDAY MAN FORCED HIS WAY FROM THE SPECTATORS‚ÄÔ SEATS ONTO THE STAGE; THE MIRROR IN WHICH FORMERLY ONLY GRAND AND BOLD TRAITS WERE REPRESENTED NOW SHOWED THE PAINFUL FIDELITY THAT CONSCIENTIOUSLY REPRODUCES EVEN THE BOTCHED OUTLINES OF NATURE.ODYSSEUS, THE TYPICAL HELLENE OF THE OLDER ART, NOW SANK, IN THE HANDS OF THE NEW POETS, TO THE FIGURE OF THE GRAECULUS, WHO, AS THE GOOD-NATUREDLY CUNNING HOUSE-SLAVE, HENCEFORTH OCCUPIES THE CENTER OF DRAMATIC INTEREST. WHAT EURIPIDES CLAIMS CREDIT FOR IN ARISTOPHANES‚ÄÔ FROGS,2 NAMELY, THAT HIS NOSTRUMS HAVE LIBERATED TRAGIC ART FROM ITS POMPOUS CORPULENCY, IS APPARENT ABOVE ALL IN HIS TRAGIC HEROES. THE SPECTATOR NOW ACTUALLY SAW AND HEARD HIS DOUBLE ON THE EURIPIDEAN STAGE, AND REJOICED THAT HE COULD TALK SO WELL. BUT THIS JOY WAS NOT ALL: ONE COULD EVEN LEARN FROM EURIPIDES HOW TO SPEAK ONESELF. HE PRIDES HIMSELF UPON THIS IN HIS CONTEST WITH AESCHYLUS: FROM HIM THE PEOPLE HAVE LEARNED HOW TO OBSERVE, DEBATE, AND DRAW CONCLUSIONS ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF ART AND WITH THE CLEVEREST SOPHISTRIES. THROUGH THIS REVOLUTION IN ORDINARY LANGUAGE, HE MADE THE NEW COMEDY POSSIBLE. FOR HENCEFORTH IT WAS NO LONGER A SECRET HOW‚ÄÎAND WITH WHAT MAXIMS‚ÄÎEVERYDAY LIFE COULD BE REPRESENTED ON THE STAGE. CIVIC MEDIOCRITY, ON WHICH EURIPIDES BUILT ALL HIS POLITICAL HOPES, WAS NOW GIVEN A VOICE, WHILE HERETOFORE THE DEMIGOD IN TRAGEDY AND THE DRUNKEN SATYR, OR DEMIMAN, IN COMEDY, HAD DETERMINED THE CHARACTER OF THE LANGUAGE. AND SO THE ARISTOPHANEAN EURIPIDES PRIDES HIMSELF ON HAVING PORTRAYED THE COMMON, FAMILIAR, EVERYDAY LIFE AND ACTIVITIES OF THE PEOPLE, ABOUT WHICH ALL ARE QUALIFIED TO PASS JUDGMENT. IF THE ENTIRE POPULACE NOW PHILOSOPHIZED, MANAGED LAND AND GOODS, AND CONDUCTED LAWSUITS WITH UNHEARD-OF CIRCUMSPECTION, HE DESERVED THE CREDIT, FOR THIS WAS THE RESULT OF THE WISDOM HE HAD INCULCATED IN THE PEOPLE.IT WAS TO A POPULACE THUS PREPARED AND ENLIGHTENED THAT THE NEW COMEDY COULD ADDRESS ITSELF: IT WAS EURIPIDES WHO HAD TAUGHT, AS IT WERE, THE CHORUS; ONLY NOW THE CHORUS OF SPECTATORS HAD TO BE TRAINED. AS SOON AS THIS CHORUS WAS TRAINED TO SING IN THE EURIPIDEAN KEY, THERE AROSE THAT DRAMA WHICH RESEMBLES A GAME OF CHESS‚ÄÎTHE NEW COMEDY, WITH ITS PERPETUAL TRIUMPHS OF CUNNING AND CRAFTINESS. BUT EURIPIDES‚ÄÎTHE CHORUS MASTER‚ÄÎWAS PRAISED CONTINUALLY: INDEED, PEOPLE WOULD HAVE KILLED THEMSELVES IN ORDER TO LEARN STILL MORE FROM HIM, IF THEY HAD NOT KNOWN THAT THE TRAGIC POETS WERE QUITE AS DEAD AS TRAGEDY. BUT WITH THAT, THE HELLENE HAD GIVEN UP HIS BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY; NOT ONLY HIS BELIEF IN AN IDEAL PAST, BUT ALSO HIS BELIEF IN AN IDEAL FUTURE. THE WORDS OF THE WELL-KNOWN EPITAPH, ‚ÄÚFRIVOLOUS AND ECCENTRIC WHEN AN OLD MAN,‚ÄÙ3 ALSO SUIT AGING HELLENISM. THE PASSING MOMENT, WIT, LEVITY, AND CAPRICE ARE ITS HIGHEST DEITIES; THE FIFTH ESTATE, THAT OF THE SLAVES, NOW COMES TO POWER, AT LEAST IN SENTIMENT; AND IF WE MAY STILL SPEAK AT ALL OF ‚ÄÚGREEK CHEERFULNESS,‚ÄÙ IT IS THE CHEERFULNESS OF THE SLAVE WHO HAS NOTHING OF CONSEQUENCE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR, NOTHING GREAT TO STRIVE FOR, AND WHO DOES NOT VALUE ANYTHING IN THE PAST OR FUTURE HIGHER THAN THE PRESENT.IT WAS THIS SEMBLANCE OF ‚ÄÚGREEK CHEERFULNESS‚ÄÙ WHICH SO AROUSED THE PROFOUND AND FORMIDABLE NATURES OF THE FIRST FOUR CENTURIES OF CHRISTIANITY: THIS WOMANISH FLIGHT FROM SERIOUSNESS AND TERROR, THIS CRAVEN SATISFACTION WITH EASY ENJOYMENT, SEEMED TO THEM NOT ONLY CONTEMPTIBLE, BUT A SPECIFICALLY ANTI-CHRISTIAN SENTIMENT. AND IT IS DUE TO THEIR INFLUENCE THAT THE CONCEPTION OF GREEK ANTIQUITY WHICH ENDURED THROUGH THE CENTURIES CLUNG WITH ALMOST UNCONQUERABLE PERSISTENCY TO THAT PINK HUE OF CHEERFULNESS‚ÄÎAS IF THERE HAD NEVER BEEN A SIXTH CENTURY WITH ITS BIRTH OF TRAGEDY, ITS MYSTERIES, ITS PYTHAGORAS AND HERACLITUS, AS IF THE WORKS OF ART OF THE GREAT PERIOD SIMPLY DID NOT EXIST, THOUGH THESE PHENOMENA CAN HARDLY BE EXPLAINED AS HAVING ORIGINATED IN ANY SUCH SENILE AND SLAVISH PLEASURE IN EXISTENCE AND CHEERFULNESS, AND POINT TO A WHOLLY DIFFERENT CONCEPTION OF THE WORLD AS THE GROUND OF THEIR EXISTENCE.THE ASSERTION MADE ABOVE, THAT EURIPIDES BROUGHT THE SPECTATOR ONTO THE STAGE AND THUS QUALIFIED HIM TO PASS JUDGMENT ON THE DRAMA, MAKES IT APPEAR AS IF THE OLDER TRAGIC ART HAD ALWAYS SUFFERED FROM BAD RELATIONS WITH THE SPECTATOR; AND ONE MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO EXTOL AS AN ADVANCE OVER SOPHOCLES THE RADICAL TENDENCY OF EURIPIDES TO PRODUCE A PROPER RELATION BETWEEN ART AND THE PUBLIC. BUT ‚ÄÚPUBLIC,‚ÄÙ AFTER ALL, IS A MERE WORD. IN NO SENSE IS IT A HOMOGENEOUS AND CONSTANT QUANTITY. WHY SHOULD THE ARTIST BE BOUND TO ACCOMMODATE HIMSELF TO A POWER WHOSE STRENGTH LIES SOLELY IN NUMBERS? AND IF, BY VIRTUE OF HIS ENDOWMENTS AND ASPIRATIONS, HE SHOULD FEEL HIMSELF SUPERIOR TO EVERY ONE OF THESE SPECTATORS, HOW COULD HE FEEL GREATER RESPECT FOR THE COLLECTIVE EXPRESSION OF ALL THESE SUBORDINATE CAPACITIES THAN FOR THE RELATIVELY HIGHEST-ENDOWED INDIVIDUAL SPECTATOR? IN TRUTH, IF EVER A GREEK ARTIST THROUGHOUT A LONG LIFE TREATED HIS PUBLIC WITH AUDACITY AND SELF-SUFFICIENCY, IT WAS EURIPIDES. WHEN THE MASSES THREW THEMSELVES AT HIS FEET, HE OPENLY AND WITH SUBLIME DEFIANCE REVERSED HIS OWN TENDENCY, THE VERY TENDENCY WITH WHICH HE HAD WON OVER THE MASSES. IF THIS GENIUS HAD HAD THE SLIGHTEST REVERENCE FOR THE PANDEMONIUM OF THE PUBLIC, HE WOULD HAVE BROKEN DOWN LONG BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF HIS CAREER, BENEATH THE HEAVY BLOWS OF HIS FAILURES.THESE CONSIDERATIONS MAKE IT CLEAR THAT OUR FORMULA‚ÄÎTHAT EURIPIDES BROUGHT THE SPECTATOR ONTO THE STAGE IN ORDER TO MAKE HIM TRULY COMPETENT TO PASS JUDGMENT‚ÄÎWAS MERELY PROVISIONAL; WE MUST PENETRATE MORE DEEPLY TO UNDERSTAND HIS TENDENCY. CONVERSELY, IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT AESCHYLUS AND SOPHOCLES DURING THE WHOLE OF THEIR LIVES, AND INDEED LONG AFTER, WERE IN COMPLETE POSSESSION OF THE PEOPLE‚ÄÔS FAVOR, SO THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION OF A FALSE RELATION BETWEEN ART AND THE PUBLIC IN THE CASE OF THESE PREDECESSORS OF EURIPIDES. WHAT WAS IT THEN THAT FORCIBLY DROVE THIS ARTIST, SO RICHLY ENDOWED, SO CONSTANTLY IMPELLED TO PRODUCTION, FROM THE PATH WARMED BY THE SUN OF THE GREATEST NAMES IN POETRY AND COVERED BY THE CLOUDLESS HEAVEN OF POPULAR FAVOR? WHAT STRANGE CONSIDERATION FOR THE SPECTATOR LED HIM TO OPPOSE THE SPECTATOR? HOW COULD HE, OUT OF TOO GREAT A RESPECT FOR HIS PUBLIC‚ÄÎDESPISE HIS PUBLIC?EURIPIDES‚ÄÎAND THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF THE RIDDLE JUST PROPOUNDED‚ÄÎUNDOUBTEDLY FELT HIMSELF, AS A POET, SUPERIOR TO THE MASSES IN GENERAL; BUT TO TWO OF HIS SPECTATORS HE DID NOT FEEL SUPERIOR. HE BROUGHT THE MASSES ONTO THE STAGE; BUT THESE TWO SPECTATORS HE REVERED AS THE ONLY COMPETENT JUDGES AND MASTERS OF HIS ART. COMPLYING WITH THEIR DIRECTIONS AND ADMONITIONS, HE TRANSFERRED THE ENTIRE WORLD OF SENTIMENTS, PASSIONS, AND EXPERIENCES, HITHERTO PRESENT AT EVERY FESTIVAL PERFORMANCE AS THE INVISIBLE CHORUS ON THE SPECTATORS‚ÄÔ BENCHES, INTO THE SOULS OF HIS STAGE-HEROES. HE YIELDED TO THEIR DEMANDS, TOO, WHEN FOR THESE NEW CHARACTERS HE SOUGHT OUT A NEW LANGUAGE AND A NEW TONE. ONLY IN THEIR VOICES COULD HE HEAR ANY CONCLUSIVE VERDICT ON HIS WORK, AND ALSO THE ENCOURAGEMENT THAT PROMISED EVENTUAL SUCCESS WHEN, AS USUAL, HE FOUND HIMSELF CONDEMNED BY THE PUBLIC JUDGMENT.OF THESE TWO SPECTATORS, ONE IS‚ÄÎEURIPIDES HIMSELF, EURIPIDES AS THINKER, NOT AS POET. IT MIGHT BE SAID OF HIM, AS OF LESSING, THAT HIS EXTRAORDINARY FUND OF CRITICAL TALENT, IF IT DID NOT CREATE, AT LEAST CONSTANTLY STIMULATED HIS PRODUCTIVE ARTISTIC IMPULSE. WITH THIS GIFT, WITH ALL THE BRIGHTNESS AND DEXTERITY OF HIS CRITICAL THINKING, EURIPIDES HAD SAT IN THE THEATER AND STRIVEN TO RECOGNIZE IN THE MASTERPIECES OF HIS GREAT PREDECESSORS, AS IN PAINTINGS THAT HAVE BECOME DARK, FEATURE AFTER FEATURE, LINE AFTER LINE. AND HERE HE HAD EXPERIENCED SOMETHING WHICH SHOULD NOT SURPRISE ANYONE INITIATED INTO THE DEEPER SECRETS OF AESCHYLEAN TRAGEDY. HE OBSERVED SOMETHING INCOMMENSURABLE IN EVERY FEATURE AND IN EVERY LINE, A CERTAIN DECEPTIVE DISTINCTNESS AND AT THE SAME TIME AN ENIGMATIC DEPTH, INDEED AN INFINITUDE, IN THE BACKGROUND. EVEN THE CLEAREST FIGURE ALWAYS HAD A COMET‚ÄÔS TAIL ATTACHED TO IT WHICH SEEMED TO SUGGEST THE UNCERTAIN, THAT WHICH COULD NEVER BE ILLUMINATED. A SIMILAR TWILIGHT SHROUDED THE STRUCTURE OF THE DRAMA, ESPECIALLY THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHORUS. AND HOW DUBIOUS THE SOLUTION OF THE ETHICAL PROBLEMS REMAINED TO HIM! HOW QUESTIONABLE THE TREATMENT OF THE MYTHS! HOW UNEQUAL THE DISTRIBUTION OF GOOD AND BAD FORTUNE! EVEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE OLD TRAGEDY THERE WAS MUCH HE FOUND OFFENSIVE, OR AT LEAST ENIGMATIC; ESPECIALLY HE FOUND TOO MUCH POMP FOR SIMPLE AFFAIRS, TOO MANY TROPES AND MONSTROUS EXPRESSIONS TO SUIT THE PLAINNESS OF THE CHARACTERS. SO HE SAT IN THE THEATER, PONDERING UNEASILY, AND AS A SPECTATOR HE CONFESSED TO HIMSELF THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS GREAT PREDECESSORS. BUT IF THE UNDERSTANDING WAS FOR HIM THE REAL ROOT OF ALL ENJOYMENT AND CREATION, HE HAD TO INQUIRE AND LOOK AROUND TO SEE WHETHER NO ONE ELSE HAD THE SAME OPINION AND ALSO FELT THIS INCOMMENSURABILITY. BUT MOST PEOPLE, AND AMONG THEM THE FINEST INDIVIDUALS, HAD ONLY A SUSPICIOUS SMILE FOR HIM, AND NONE COULD EXPLAIN TO HIM WHY THE GREAT MASTERS WERE STILL IN THE RIGHT DESPITE HIS SCRUPLES AND OBJECTIONS. AND IN THIS STATE OF TORMENT, HE FOUND THAT OTHER SPECTATOR WHO DID NOT COMPREHEND TRAGEDY AND THEREFORE DID NOT ESTEEM IT. ALLIED WITH HIM, HE COULD NOW VENTURE FROM HIS SOLITUDE TO BEGIN THE TREMENDOUS STRUGGLE AGAINST THE ART OF AESCHYLUS AND SOPHOCLES‚ÄÎNOT WITH POLEMICAL ESSAYS, BUT AS A DRAMATIC POET WHO OPPOSED HIS CONCEPTION OF TRAGEDY TO THE TRADITIONAL ONE.BEFORE WE NAME THIS OTHER SPECTATOR, LET US PAUSE HERE A MOMENT TO RECALL TO OUR MINDS OUR PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED IMPRESSION OF THE DISCORDANT AND INCOMMENSURABLE ELEMENTS IN THE NATURE OF AESCHYLEAN TRAGEDY. LET US RECALL OUR SURPRISE AT THE CHORUS AND THE TRAGIC HERO OF THAT TRAGEDY, NEITHER OF WHICH WE COULD RECONCILE WITH OUR OWN CUSTOMS ANY MORE THAN WITH TRADITION‚ÄÎTILL WE REDISCOVERED THIS DUALITY ITSELF AS THE ORIGIN AND ESSENCE OF GREEK TRAGEDY, AS THE EXPRESSION OF TWO INTERWOVEN ARTISTIC IMPULSES, THE APOLLINIAN AND THE DIONYSIAN.TO SEPARATE THIS ORIGINAL AND ALL-POWERFUL DIONYSIAN ELEMENT FROM TRAGEDY, AND TO RECONSTRUCT TRAGEDY PURELY ON THE BASIS OF AN UN-DIONYSIAN ART, MORALITY, AND WORLD VIEW‚ÄÎTHIS IS THE TENDENCY OF EURIPIDES AS IT NOW REVEALS ITSELF TO US IN CLEAR ILLUMINATION.IN THE EVENING OF HIS LIFE, EURIPIDES HIMSELF PROPOUNDED TO HIS CONTEMPORARIES THE QUESTION OF THE VALUE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS TENDENCY, USING A MYTH. IS THE DIONYSIAN ENTITLED TO EXIST AT ALL? SHOULD IT NOT BE FORCIBLY UPROOTED FROM HELLENIC SOIL? CERTAINLY, THE POET TELLS US, IF IT WERE ONLY POSSIBLE: BUT THE GOD DIONYSUS IS TOO POWERFUL; HIS MOST INTELLIGENT ADVERSARY‚ÄÎLIKE PENTHEUS IN THE BACCHAE‚ÄÎIS UNWITTINGLY ENCHANTED BY HIM, AND IN THIS ENCHANTMENT RUNS TO MEET HIS FATE. THE JUDGMENT OF THE TWO OLD MEN, CADMUS AND TIRESIAS, SEEMS ALSO TO BE THE JUDGMENT OF THE OLD POET: THE REFLECTION OF THE WISEST INDIVIDUALS DOES NOT OVERTHROW THESE OLD POPULAR TRADITIONS, NOR THE PERPETUALLY SELF-PROPAGATING WORSHIP OF DIONYSUS; RATHER IT IS PROPER TO DISPLAY A DIPLOMATICALLY CAUTIOUS INTEREST IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH MARVELOUS FORCES‚ÄÎALTHOUGH THE POSSIBILITY REMAINS THAT THE GOD MAY TAKE OFFENSE AT SUCH LUKEWARM PARTICIPATION, AND EVENTUALLY TRANSFORM THE DIPLOMAT‚ÄÎLIKE CADMUS‚ÄÎINTO A DRAGON. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE TOLD BY A POET WHO OPPOSED DIONYSUS WITH HEROIC VALOR THROUGHOUT A LONG LIFE‚ÄÎAND WHO FINALLY ENDED HIS CAREER WITH A GLORIFICATION OF HIS ADVERSARY AND WITH SUICIDE, LIKE A GIDDY MAN WHO, TO ESCAPE THE HORRIBLE VERTIGO HE CAN NO LONGER ENDURE, CASTS HIMSELF FROM A TOWER.THIS TRAGEDY WAS A PROTEST AGAINST THE PRACTICABILITY OF HIS OWN TENDENCY; BUT ALAS, IT HAD ALREADY BEEN PUT INTO PRACTICE! THE MARVEL HAD HAPPENED: WHEN THE POET RECANTED, HIS TENDENCY HAD ALREADY TRIUMPHED. DIONYSUS HAD ALREADY BEEN SCARED FROM THE TRAGIC STAGE, BY A DEMONIC POWER SPEAKING THROUGH EURIPIDES. EVEN EURIPIDES WAS, IN A SENSE, ONLY A MASK: THE DEITY THAT SPOKE THROUGH HIM WAS NEITHER DIONYSUS NOR APOLLO, BUT AN ALTOGETHER NEWBORN DEMON, CALLED SOCRATES.THIS IS THE NEW OPPOSITION: THE DIONYSIAN AND THE SOCRATIC‚ÄÎAND THE ART OF GREEK TRAGEDY WAS WRECKED ON THIS. THOUGH EURIPIDES MAY SEEK TO COMFORT US BY HIS RECANTATION, HE DOES NOT SUCCEED: THE MOST MAGNIFICENT TEMPLE LIES IN RUINS. WHAT DOES THE LAMENTATION OF THE DESTROYER PROFIT US, OR HIS CONFESSION THAT IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL TEMPLES? AND EVEN IF EURIPIDES HAS BEEN PUNISHED BY BEING CHANGED INTO A DRAGON BY THE ART CRITICS OF ALL AGES‚ÄÎWHO COULD BE CONTENT WITH SO MISERABLE A COMPENSATION?LET US NOW APPROACH THIS SOCRATIC TENDENCY WITH WHICH EURIPIDES COMBATED AND VANQUISHED AESCHYLEAN TRAGEDY.WE MUST NOW ASK OURSELVES, WHAT COULD BE THE AIM OF THE EURIPIDEAN DESIGN, WHICH, IN ITS MOST IDEAL FORM, WOULD WISH TO BASE DRAMA EXCLUSIVELY ON THE UN-DIONYSIAN? WHAT FORM OF DRAMA STILL REMAINED, IF IT WAS NOT TO BE BORN OF THE WOMB OF MUSIC, IN THE MYSTERIOUS TWILIGHT OF THE DIONYSIAN? ONLY THE DRAMATIZED EPOS‚ÄÎBUT IN THIS APOLLINIAN DOMAIN OF ART THE TRAGIC EFFECT IS CERTAINLY UNATTAINABLE. THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE EVENTS REPRESENTED IS NOT DECISIVE; INDEED, I SUGGEST THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR GOETHE IN HIS PROJECTED NAUSIKAA TO HAVE RENDERED TRAGICALLY EFFECTIVE THE SUICIDE OF THIS IDYLLIC BEING, WHICH WAS TO HAVE COMPLETED THE FIFTH ACT. SO EXTRAORDINARY IS THE POWER OF THE EPIC-APOLLINIAN THAT BEFORE OUR EYES IT TRANSFORMS THE MOST TERRIBLE THINGS BY THE JOY IN MERE APPEARANCE AND IN REDEMPTION THROUGH MERE APPEARANCE. THE POET OF THE DRAMATIZED EPOS CANNOT BLEND COMPLETELY WITH HIS IMAGES ANY MORE THAN THE EPIC RHAPSODIST CAN. HE IS STILL THAT CALM, UNMOVED CONTEMPLATION WHICH SEES THE IMAGES BEFORE ITS WIDE-OPEN EYES. THE ACTOR IN THIS DRAMATIZED EPOS STILL REMAINS FUNDAMENTALLY A RHAPSODIST: THE CONSECRATION OF THE INNER DREAM LIES ON ALL HIS ACTIONS, SO THAT HE IS NEVER WHOLLY AN ACTOR.HOW, THEN, IS THE EURIPIDEAN PLAY RELATED TO THIS IDEAL OF THE APOLLINIAN DRAMA? JUST AS THE YOUNGER RHAPSODIST IS RELATED TO THE SOLEMN RHAPSODIST OF OLD TIMES. IN THE PLATONIC ION, THE YOUNGER RHAPSODIST DESCRIBES HIS OWN NATURE AS FOLLOWS: ‚ÄÚWHEN I AM SAYING ANYTHING SAD, MY EYES FILL WITH TEARS; AND WHEN I AM SAYING SOMETHING AWFUL AND TERRIBLE, THEN MY HAIR STANDS ON END WITH FRIGHT AND MY HEART BEATS QUICKLY.‚ÄÙ HERE WE NO LONGER REMARK ANYTHING OF THE EPIC ABSORPTION IN MERE APPEARANCE, OR OF THE DISPASSIONATE COOLNESS OF THE TRUE ACTOR, WHO PRECISELY IN HIS HIGHEST ACTIVITY IS WHOLLY MERE APPEARANCE AND JOY IN MERE APPEARANCE. EURIPIDES IS THE ACTOR WHOSE HEART BEATS, WHOSE HAIR STANDS ON END; AS SOCRATIC THINKER HE DESIGNS THE PLAN, AS PASSIONATE ACTOR HE EXECUTES IT. NEITHER IN THE DESIGNING NOR IN THE EXECUTION IS HE A PURE ARTIST. THUS THE EURIPIDEAN DRAMA IS A THING BOTH COOL AND FIERY, EQUALLY CAPABLE OF FREEZING AND BURNING. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR IT TO ATTAIN THE APOLLINIAN EFFECT OF THE EPOS, WHILE, ON THE OTHER HAND, IT HAS ALIENATED ITSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FROM DIONYSIAN ELEMENTS. NOW, IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE AT ALL, IT REQUIRES NEW STIMULANTS, WHICH CAN NO LONGER LIE WITHIN THE SPHERE OF THE ONLY TWO ART-IMPULSES, THE APOLLINIAN AND THE DIONYSIAN. THESE STIMULANTS ARE COOL, PARADOXICAL THOUGHTS, REPLACING APOLLINIAN CONTEMPLATION‚ÄÎAND FIERY AFFECTS, REPLACING DIONYSIAN ECSTASIES; AND, IT MAY BE ADDED, THOUGHTS AND AFFECTS COPIED VERY REALISTICALLY AND IN NO SENSE DIPPED INTO THE ETHER OF ART.SO WE SEE THAT EURIPIDES DID NOT SUCCEED IN BASING THE DRAMA EXCLUSIVELY ON THE APOLLINIAN, AND HIS UN-DIONYSIAN TENDENCY ACTUALLY WENT ASTRAY AND BECAME NATURALISTIC AND INARTISTIC. NOW WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO COME CLOSER TO THE CHARACTER OF AESTHETIC SOCRATISM, WHOSE SUPREME LAW READS ROUGHLY AS FOLLOWS, ‚ÄÚTO BE BEAUTIFUL EVERYTHING MUST BE INTELLIGIBLE,‚ÄÙ AS THE COUNTERPART TO THE SOCRATIC DICTUM, ‚ÄÚKNOWLEDGE IS VIRTUE.‚ÄÙ WITH THIS CANON IN HIS HANDS, EURIPIDES MEASURED ALL THE SEPARATE ELEMENTS OF THE DRAMA‚ÄÎLANGUAGE, CHARACTERS, DRAMATURGIC STRUCTURE, AND CHORIC MUSIC‚ÄÎAND CORRECTED THEM ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE.THE POETIC DEFICIENCY AND DEGENERATION, WHICH ARE SO OFTEN IMPUTED TO EURIPIDES IN COMPARISON WITH SOPHOCLES, ARE FOR THE MOST PART PRODUCTS OF THIS PENETRATING CRITICAL PROCESS, THIS AUDACIOUS REASONABLENESS.THE EURIPIDEAN PROLOGUE MAY SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THIS RATIONALISTIC METHOD. NOTHING COULD BE MORE UNCONGENIAL TO THE TECHNIQUE OF OUR OWN STAGE THAN THE PROLOGUE IN THE DRAMA OF EURIPIDES. FOR A SINGLE PERSON TO APPEAR AT THE OUTSET OF THE PLAY, TELLING US WHO HE IS, WHAT PRECEDES THE ACTION, WHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR, EVEN WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE COURSE OF THE PLAY, WOULD BE CONDEMNED BY A MODERN PLAYWRIGHT AS A WILLFUL, INEXCUSABLE ABANDONMENT OF THE EFFECT OF SUSPENSE. WE KNOW EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN; WHO WOULD WANT TO WAIT TILL IT ACTUALLY DOES HAPPEN? AFTER ALL, WE DO NOT EVEN HAVE THE EXCITING RELATION OF A PROPHETIC DREAM TO A REALITY THAT COMES TO BE LATER ON. BUT EURIPIDES DID NOT THINK LIKE THAT AT ALL. THE EFFECT OF TRAGEDY NEVER DEPENDED ON EPIC SUSPENSE, ON A FASCINATING UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHAT IS TO HAPPEN NOW AND AFTERWARD, BUT RATHER ON THE GREAT RHETORICAL-LYRICAL SCENES IN WHICH THE PASSION AND DIALECTIC OF THE PROTAGONIST SWELLED TO A BROAD AND POWERFUL CURRENT. EVERYTHING LAID THE GROUND FOR PATHOS, NOT FOR ACTION: AND WHATEVER WAS NOT DIRECTED TOWARD PATHOS WAS CONSIDERED OBJECTIONABLE. BUT WHAT INTERFERES MOST WITH THE HEARER‚ÄÔS PLEASURABLE ABSORPTION IN SUCH SCENES IS ANY MISSING LINK, ANY GAP IN THE TEXTURE OF THE BACKGROUND STORY. SO LONG AS THE SPECTATOR HAS TO FIGURE OUT THE MEANING OF THIS OR THAT PERSON, OR THE PRESUPPOSITIONS OF THIS OR THAT CONFLICT OF INCLINATIONS AND PURPOSES, HE CANNOT BECOME COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN THE ACTIVITIES AND SUFFERINGS OF THE CHIEF CHARACTERS OR FEEL BREATHLESS PITY AND FEAR.AESCHYLEAN-SOPHOCLEAN TRAGEDY EMPLOYED THE MOST INGENIOUS DEVICES IN THE INITIAL SCENES TO PLACE IN THE SPECTATOR‚ÄÔS HANDS, AS IF BY CHANCE, ALL THE THREADS NECESSARY FOR A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING‚ÄÎA TRAIT PROVING THAT NOBLE ARTISTRY WHICH, AS IT WERE, MASKS THE NECESSARY FORMAL ELEMENT AND MAKES IT APPEAR ACCIDENTAL. YET EURIPIDES THOUGHT HE OBSERVED THAT DURING THESE FIRST SCENES THE SPECTATOR WAS SO ANXIOUS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THE BACKGROUND HISTORY THAT THE POETIC BEAUTIES AND THE PATHOS OF THE EXPOSITION WERE LOST ON HIM. SO HE PUT THE PROLOGUE EVEN BEFORE THE EXPOSITION, AND PLACED IT IN THE MOUTH OF A PERSON WHO COULD BE TRUSTED: OFTEN SOME DEITY HAD TO GUARANTEE THE PLOT OF THE TRAGEDY TO THE PUBLIC, TO REMOVE EVERY DOUBT AS TO THE REALITY OF THE MYTH‚ÄÎSOMEWHAT AS DESCARTES COULD PROVE THE REALITY OF THE EMPIRICAL WORLD ONLY BY APPEALING TO THE TRUTHFULNESS OF GOD AND HIS INABILITY TO UTTER FALSEHOOD. EURIPIDES MAKES USE OF THIS SAME DIVINE TRUTHFULNESS ONCE MORE AT THE CLOSE OF HIS DRAMA, IN ORDER TO REASSURE THE PUBLIC AS TO THE FUTURE OF HIS HEROES; THIS IS THE TASK OF THE NOTORIOUS DEUS EX MACHINA. BETWEEN THIS EPIC PREVIEW AND EPIC PROSPECT LIES THE DRAMATIC-LYRIC PRESENT, THE ‚ÄÚDRAMA‚ÄÙ PROPER.THUS EURIPIDES AS A POET IS ESSENTIALLY AN ECHO OF HIS OWN CONSCIOUS KNOWLEDGE; AND IT IS PRECISELY ON THIS ACCOUNT THAT HE OCCUPIES SUCH A REMARKABLE POSITION IN THE HISTORY OF GREEK ART. WITH REFERENCE TO HIS CRITICAL-PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITY, HE MUST OFTEN HAVE FELT AS IF HE HAD TO BRING TO LIFE FOR DRAMA THE BEGINNING OF THE ESSAY OF ANAXAGORAS: ‚ÄÚIN THE BEGINNING ALL THINGS WERE MIXED TOGETHER; THEN CAME THE UNDERSTANDING AND CREATED ORDER.‚ÄÙ ANAXAGORAS WITH HIS ‚ÄÚNOUS‚ÄÙ1 IS SAID TO HAVE APPEARED AMONG PHILOSOPHERS AS THE FIRST SOBER PERSON2 AMID A CROWD OF DRUNKEN ONES. EURIPIDES MAY HAVE CONCEIVED HIS RELATION TO THE OTHER TRAGIC POETS IN TERMS OF A SIMILAR IMAGE. AS LONG AS THE SOLE RULER AND DISPOSER OF THE UNIVERSE, THE NOUS, REMAINED EXCLUDED FROM ARTISTIC ACTIVITY, THINGS WERE ALL MIXED TOGETHER IN A PRIMEVAL CHAOS: THIS WAS WHAT EURIPIDES MUST HAVE THOUGHT; AND SO, AS THE FIRST ‚ÄÚSOBER‚ÄÙ ONE AMONG THEM, HE HAD TO CONDEMN THE ‚ÄÚDRUNKEN‚ÄÙ POETS. SOPHOCLES SAID OF AESCHYLUS THAT HE DID WHAT WAS RIGHT, THOUGH HE DID IT UNCONSCIOUSLY. THIS WAS SURELY NOT HOW EURIPIDES SAW IT. HE MIGHT HAVE SAID THAT AESCHYLUS, BECAUSE HE CREATED UNCONSCIOUSLY, DID WHAT WAS WRONG. THE DIVINE PLATO, TOO, ALMOST ALWAYS SPEAKS ONLY IRONICALLY OF THE CREATIVE FACULTY OF THE POET, INSOFAR AS IT IS NOT CONSCIOUS INSIGHT, AND PLACES IT ON A PAR WITH THE GIFT OF THE SOOTHSAYER AND DREAM-INTERPRETER: THE POET IS INCAPABLE OF COMPOSING UNTIL HE HAS BECOME UNCONSCIOUS AND BEREFT OF UNDERSTANDING. LIKE PLATO, EURIPIDES UNDERTOOK TO SHOW TO THE WORLD THE REVERSE OF THE ‚ÄÚUNINTELLIGENT‚ÄÙ POET; HIS AESTHETIC PRINCIPLE THAT ‚ÄÚTO BE BEAUTIFUL EVERYTHING MUST BE CONSCIOUS‚ÄÙ IS, AS I HAVE SAID, THE PARALLEL TO THE SOCRATIC, ‚ÄÚTO BE GOOD EVERYTHING MUST BE CONSCIOUS.‚ÄÙ SO WE MAY CONSIDER EURIPIDES AS THE POET OF AESTHETIC SOCRATISM.SOCRATES, HOWEVER, WAS THAT SECOND SPECTATOR WHO DID NOT COMPREHEND AND THEREFORE DID NOT ESTEEM THE OLD TRAGEDY; IN ALLIANCE WITH HIM EURIPIDES DARED TO BE THE HERALD OF A NEW ART. IF IT WAS THIS OF WHICH THE OLDER TRAGEDY PERISHED, THEN AESTHETIC SOCRATISM WAS THE MURDEROUS PRINCIPLE; BUT INSOFAR AS THE STRUGGLE WAS DIRECTED AGAINST THE DIONYSIAN ELEMENT IN THE OLDER TRAGEDY, WE MAY RECOGNIZE IN SOCRATES THE OPPONENT OF DIONYSUS. HE IS THE NEW ORPHEUS WHO ROSE AGAINST DIONYSUS, AND ALTHOUGH HE IS DESTINED TO BE TORN TO PIECES BY THE MAENADS OF THE ATHENIAN COURT, HE STILL PUT TO FLIGHT THE POWERFUL GOD HIMSELF‚ÄÎWHO, AS ON HIS FLIGHT FROM LYCURGUS THE KING OF EDONI, SOUGHT REFUGE IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA, NAMELY THE MYSTICAL FLOOD OF A SECRET CULT WHICH GRADUALLY COVERED THE EARTH. THAT SOCRATES WAS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE TENDENCY OF EURIPIDES DID NOT ESCAPE THE NOTICE OF CONTEMPORANEOUS ANTIQUITY. THE MOST ELOQUENT EXPRESSION OF THIS FELICITOUS INSIGHT WAS THE STORY CURRENT IN ATHENS THAT SOCRATES USED TO HELP EURIPIDES WRITE HIS PLAYS. WHENEVER AN OCCASION AROSE TO ENUMERATE THE DEMAGOGUES OF THE DAY, THE ADHERENTS OF THE ‚ÄÚGOOD OLD TIMES‚ÄÙ WOULD MENTION BOTH NAMES IN THE SAME BREATH. TO THE INFLUENCE OF SOCRATES AND EURIPIDES THEY ATTRIBUTED THE FACT THAT THE OLD MARATHONIAN STALWART FITNESS OF BODY AND SOUL WAS BEING SACRIFICED MORE AND MORE TO A DUBIOUS ENLIGHTENMENT THAT INVOLVED THE PROGRESSIVE DEGENERATION OF THE POWERS OF BODY AND SOUL. IT IS IN THIS TONE, HALF INDIGNANT, HALF CONTEMPTUOUS, THAT ARISTOPHANIC COMEDY USED TO SPEAK OF BOTH OF THEM‚ÄÎTO THE CONSTERNATION OF MODERN MEN, WHO ARE QUITE WILLING TO GIVE UP EURIPIDES, BUT WHO CANNOT GIVE SUFFICIENT EXPRESSION TO THEIR ASTONISHMENT THAT IN ARISTOPHANES SOCRATES SHOULD APPEAR AS THE FIRST AND SUPREME SOPHIST, AS THE MIRROR AND EPITOME OF ALL SOPHISTICAL TENDENCIES. THEIR ONLY CONSOLATION IS TO PILLORY ARISTOPHANES HIMSELF AS A DISSOLUTE, MENDACIOUS ALCIBIADES OF POETRY. WITHOUT HERE DEFENDING THE PROFOUND INSTINCT OF ARISTOPHANES AGAINST SUCH ATTACKS, I SHALL CONTINUE TO SHOW, BY MEANS OF THE SENTIMENTS OF THE TIME, THE CLOSE CONNECTION BETWEEN SOCRATES AND EURIPIDES. WITH THIS IN VIEW, WE MUST REMEMBER PARTICULARLY HOW SOCRATES, AS AN OPPONENT OF TRAGIC ART, REFRAINED FROM ATTENDING TRAGEDIES AND APPEARED AMONG THE SPECTATORS ONLY WHEN A NEW PLAY OF EURIPIDES WAS TO BE PERFORMED. MOST FAMOUS OF ALL, HOWEVER, IS THE JUXTAPOSITION OF THE TWO NAMES BY THE DELPHIC ORACLE, WHICH DESIGNATED SOCRATES AS THE WISEST OF MEN AND AT THE SAME TIME DECIDED THAT THE SECOND PRIZE IN THE CONTEST OF WISDOM BELONGED TO EURIPIDES.SOPHOCLES WAS NAMED THIRD IN ORDER OF RANK‚ÄÎHE WHO COULD BOAST THAT, AS COMPARED WITH AESCHYLUS, HE DID WHAT WAS RIGHT BECAUSE HE KNEW WHAT WAS RIGHT. EVIDENTLY IT IS PRECISELY THE DEGREE OF THE BRIGHTNESS OF THIS KNOWLEDGE WHICH DISTINGUISHES THESE THREE MEN IN COMMON AS THE THREE ‚ÄÚKNOWING ONES‚ÄÙ OF THEIR TIME.THE MOST ACUTE WORD, HOWEVER, ABOUT THIS NEW AND UNPRECEDENTED VALUE SET ON KNOWLEDGE AND INSIGHT WAS SPOKEN BY SOCRATES WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO ACKNOWLEDGED TO HIMSELF THAT HE KNEW NOTHING, WHEREAS IN HIS CRITICAL PEREGRINATIONS THROUGH ATHENS HE HAD CALLED ON THE GREATEST STATESMEN, ORATORS, POETS, AND ARTISTS, AND HAD EVERYWHERE DISCOVERED THE CONCEIT OF KNOWLEDGE. TO HIS ASTONISHMENT HE PERCEIVED THAT ALL THESE CELEBRITIES WERE WITHOUT A PROPER AND SURE INSIGHT, EVEN WITH REGARD TO THEIR OWN PROFESSIONS, AND THAT THEY PRACTICED THEM ONLY BY INSTINCT. ‚ÄÚONLY BY INSTINCT‚ÄÙ: WITH THIS PHRASE WE TOUCH UPON THE HEART AND CORE OF THE SOCRATIC TENDENCY. WITH IT SOCRATISM CONDEMNS EXISTING ART AS WELL AS EXISTING ETHICS. WHEREVER SOCRATISM TURNS ITS SEARCHING EYES IT SEES LACK OF INSIGHT AND THE POWER OF ILLUSION; AND FROM THIS LACK IT INFERS THE ESSENTIAL PERVERSITY AND REPREHENSIBILITY OF WHAT EXISTS. BASING HIMSELF ON THIS POINT, SOCRATES CONCEIVES IT TO BE HIS DUTY TO CORRECT EXISTENCE: ALL ALONE, WITH AN EXPRESSION OF IRREVERENCE AND SUPERIORITY, AS THE PRECURSOR OF AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT CULTURE, ART, AND MORALITY, HE ENTERS A WORLD, TO TOUCH WHOSE VERY HEM WOULD GIVE US THE GREATEST HAPPINESS.THIS IS WHAT STRIKES US AS SO TREMENDOUSLY PROBLEMATIC WHENEVER WE CONSIDER SOCRATES, AND AGAIN AND AGAIN WE ARE TEMPTED TO FATHOM THE MEANING AND PURPOSE OF THIS MOST QUESTIONABLE PHENOMENON OF ANTIQUITY. WHO IS IT THAT MAY DARE SINGLE-HANDED TO NEGATE THE GREEK GENIUS THAT, AS HOMER, PINDAR, AND AESCHYLUS, AS PHIDIAS, AS PERICLES, AS PYTHIA AND DIONYSUS, AS THE DEEPEST ABYSS AND THE HIGHEST HEIGHT, IS SURE OF OUR ASTONISHED VENERATION? WHAT DEMONIC POWER IS THIS THAT DARES TO SPILL THIS MAGIC POTION INTO DUST? WHAT DEMIGOD IS THIS TO WHOM THE CHORUS OF THE NOBLEST SPIRITS OF MANKIND MUST CALL OUT:ALAS! YOU HAVE SHATTERED THE BEAUTIFUL WORLD WITH BRAZEN FIST; IT FALLS, IT IS SCATTERED.WE ARE OFFERED A KEY TO THE CHARACTER OF SOCRATES BY THE WONDERFUL PHENOMENON KNOWN AS ‚ÄÚTHE DAIMONION OF SOCRATES.‚ÄÙ IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES, WHEN HIS TREMENDOUS INTELLECT WAVERED, HE FOUND SECURE SUPPORT IN THE UTTERANCES OF A DIVINE VOICE THAT SPOKE UP AT SUCH MOMENTS. THIS VOICE, WHENEVER IT COMES, ALWAYS DISSUADES. IN THIS UTTERLY ABNORMAL NATURE, INSTINCTIVE WISDOM APPEARS ONLY IN ORDER TO HINDER CONSCIOUS KNOWLEDGE OCCASIONALLY. WHILE IN ALL PRODUCTIVE MEN IT IS INSTINCT THAT IS THE CREATIVE-AFFIRMATIVE FORCE, AND CONSCIOUSNESS ACTS CRITICALLY AND DISSUASIVELY, IN SOCRATES IT IS INSTINCT THAT BECOMES THE CRITIC, AND CONSCIOUSNESS THAT BECOMES THE CREATOR‚ÄÎTRULY A MONSTROSITY PER DEFECTUM! SPECIFICALLY, WE OBSERVE HERE A MONSTROUS DEFECTUS OF ANY MYSTICAL DISPOSITION, SO SOCRATES MIGHT BE CALLED THE TYPICAL NON-MYSTIC, IN WHOM, THROUGH A HYPERTROPHY, THE LOGICAL NATURE IS DEVELOPED AS EXCESSIVELY AS INSTINCTIVE WISDOM IS IN THE MYSTIC. BUT THE LOGICAL URGE THAT BECAME MANIFEST IN SOCRATES WAS ABSOLUTELY PREVENTED FROM TURNING AGAINST ITSELF; IN ITS UNBRIDLED FLOOD IT DISPLAYS A NATURAL POWER SUCH AS WE ENCOUNTER TO OUR AWED AMAZEMENT ONLY IN THE VERY GREATEST INSTINCTIVE FORCES. ANYONE WHO, THROUGH THE PLATONIC WRITINGS, HAS EXPERIENCED EVEN A BREATH OF THE DIVINE NA√ØVET√© AND SURENESS OF THE SOCRATIC WAY OF LIFE, WILL ALSO FEEL HOW THE ENORMOUS DRIVING-WHEEL OF LOGICAL SOCRATISM IS IN MOTION, AS IT WERE, BEHIND SOCRATES, AND THAT IT MUST BE VIEWED THROUGH SOCRATES AS THROUGH A SHADOW.

HIS OWN SENSE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP FOUND EXPRESSION IN THE DIGNIFIED SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH HE EVERYWHERE, EVEN BEFORE HIS JUDGES, INSISTED ON HIS DIVINE CALLING. AT BOTTOM, IT WAS AS IMPOSSIBLE TO REFUTE HIM HERE AS TO APPROVE OF HIS INSTINCT-DISINTEGRATING INFLUENCE. IN VIEW OF THIS INDISSOLUBLE CONFLICT, WHEN HE HAD AT LAST BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE FORUM OF THE GREEK STATE, ONLY ONE KIND OF PUNISHMENT WAS INDICATED: EXILE. BEING THOROUGHLY ENIGMATICAL, UNCLASSIFIABLE, AND INEXPLICABLE, HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ASKED TO LEAVE THE CITY, AND POSTERITY WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED IN CHARGING THE ATHENIANS WITH AN IGNOMINIOUS DEED. BUT THAT HE WAS SENTENCED TO DEATH, NOT EXILE, SOCRATES HIMSELF SEEMS TO HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT WITH PERFECT AWARENESS AND WITHOUT ANY NATURAL AWE OF DEATH. HE WENT TO HIS DEATH WITH THE CALM WITH WHICH, ACCORDING TO PLATO‚ÄÔS DESCRIPTION, HE LEAVES THE SYMPOSIUM AT DAWN, THE LAST OF THE REVELERS, TO BEGIN A NEW DAY, WHILE ON THE BENCHES AND ON THE EARTH HIS DROWSY TABLE COMPANIONS REMAIN BEHIND TO DREAM OF SOCRATES, THE TRUE EROTICIST. THE DYING SOCRATES BECAME THE NEW IDEAL, NEVER SEEN BEFORE, OF NOBLE GREEK YOUTHS: ABOVE ALL, THE TYPICAL HELLENIC YOUTH, PLATO, PROSTRATED HIMSELF BEFORE THIS IMAGE WITH ALL THE ARDENT DEVOTION OF HIS ENTHUSIASTIC SOUL.

LET US NOW IMAGINE THE ONE GREAT CYCLOPS EYE OF SOCRATES FIXED ON TRAGEDY, AN EYE IN WHICH THE FAIR FRENZY OF ARTISTIC ENTHUSIASM HAD NEVER GLOWED. TO THIS EYE WAS DENIED THE PLEASURE OF GAZING INTO THE DIONYSIAN ABYSSES. WHAT, THEN, DID IT HAVE TO SEE IN THE ‚ÄÚSUBLIME AND GREATLY LAUDED‚ÄÙ TRAGIC ART, AS PLATO CALLED IT? SOMETHING RATHER UNREASONABLE, FULL OF CAUSES APPARENTLY WITHOUT EFFECTS, AND EFFECTS APPARENTLY WITHOUT CAUSES; THE WHOLE, MOREOVER, SO MOTLEY AND MANIFOLD THAT IT COULD NOT BUT BE REPUGNANT TO A SOBER MIND, AND A DANGEROUS TINDER FOR SENSITIVE AND SUSCEPTIBLE SOULS. WE KNOW THE ONLY KIND OF POETRY HE COMPREHENDED: THE AESOPIAN FABLE; AND THIS HE FAVORED NO DOUBT WITH THE SMILING ACCOMMODATION WITH WHICH THE GOOD HONEST GELLERT SINGS THE PRAISE OF POETRY IN THE FABLE OF THE BEE AND THE HEN:

POEMS ARE USEFUL: THEY CAN TELL

THE TRUTH BY MEANS OF PARABLE

TO THOSE WHO ARE NOT VERY BRIGHT.



BUT TO SOCRATES IT SEEMED THAT TRAGIC ART DID NOT EVEN ‚ÄÚTELL THE TRUTH;‚ÄÙ MOREOVER, IT ADDRESSED ITSELF TO ‚ÄÚTHOSE WHO ARE NOT VERY BRIGHT,‚ÄÙ NOT TO THE PHILOSOPHER: A TWOFOLD REASON FOR SHUNNING IT. LIKE PLATO, HE RECKONED IT AMONG THE FLATTERING ARTS WHICH PORTRAY ONLY THE AGREEABLE, NOT THE USEFUL; AND THEREFORE HE REQUIRED OF HIS DISCIPLES ABSTINENCE AND STRICT SEPARATION FROM SUCH UNPHILOSOPHICAL ATTRACTIONS‚ÄÎWITH SUCH SUCCESS THAT THE YOUTHFUL TRAGIC POET PLATO FIRST BURNED HIS POEMS THAT HE MIGHT BECOME A STUDENT OF SOCRATES. BUT WHERE UNCONQUERABLE PROPENSITIES STRUGGLED AGAINST THE SOCRATIC MAXIMS, THEIR POWER, TOGETHER WITH THE IMPACT OF HIS TREMENDOUS CHARACTER, WAS STILL GREAT ENOUGH TO FORCE POETRY ITSELF INTO NEW AND HITHERTO UNKNOWN CHANNELS.

AN INSTANCE OF THIS IS PLATO, WHO IN CONDEMNING TRAGEDY AND ART IN GENERAL CERTAINLY DID NOT LAG BEHIND THE NA√ØVE CYNICISM OF HIS MASTER; HE WAS NEVERTHELESS CONSTRAINED BY SHEER ARTISTIC NECESSITY TO CREATE AN ART FORM THAT WAS RELATED TO THOSE FORMS OF ART WHICH HE REPUDIATED. PLATO‚ÄÔS MAIN OBJECTION TO THE OLDER ART‚ÄÎTHAT IT IS THE IMITATION OF A PHANTOM AND HENCE BELONGS TO A SPHERE EVEN LOWER THAN THE EMPIRICAL WORLD‚ÄÎCOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE DIRECTED AGAINST THE NEW ART; AND SO WE FIND PLATO ENDEAVORING TO TRANSCEND REALITY AND TO REPRESENT THE IDEA WHICH UNDERLIES THIS PSEUDO-REALITY. THUS PLATO, THE THINKER, ARRIVED BY A DETOUR WHERE HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN AT HOME AS A POET‚ÄÎAT THE POINT FROM WHICH SOPHOCLES AND THE OLDER ART PROTESTED SOLEMNLY AGAINST THAT OBJECTION. IF TRAGEDY HAD ABSORBED INTO ITSELF ALL THE EARLIER TYPES OF ART, THE SAME MIGHT ALSO BE SAID IN AN ECCENTRIC SENSE OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGUE WHICH, A MIXTURE OF ALL EXTANT STYLES AND FORMS, HOVERS MIDWAY BETWEEN NARRATIVE, LYRIC, AND DRAMA, BETWEEN PROSE AND POETRY, AND SO HAS ALSO BROKEN THE STRICT OLD LAW OF THE UNITY OF LINGUISTIC FORM. THIS TENDENCY WAS CARRIED STILL FURTHER BY THE CYNIC WRITERS, WHO IN THE GREATEST STYLISTIC MEDLEY, OSCILLATING BETWEEN PROSE AND METRICAL FORMS, REALIZED ALSO THE LITERARY IMAGE OF THE ‚ÄÚRAVING SOCRATES‚ÄÙ WHOM THEY REPRESENTED IN REAL LIFE.

THE PLATONIC DIALOGUE WAS, AS IT WERE, THE BARGE ON WHICH THE SHIPWRECKED ANCIENT POETRY SAVED HERSELF WITH ALL HER CHILDREN: CROWDED INTO A NARROW SPACE AND TIMIDLY SUBMITTING TO THE SINGLE PILOT, SOCRATES, THEY NOW SAILED INTO A NEW WORLD, WHICH NEVER TIRED OF LOOKING AT THE FANTASTIC SPECTACLE OF THIS PROCESSION. INDEED, PLATO HAS GIVEN TO ALL POSTERITY THE MODEL OF A NEW ART FORM, THE MODEL OF THE NOVEL‚ÄÎWHICH MAY BE DESCRIBED AS AN INFINITELY ENHANCED AESOPIAN FABLE, IN WHICH POETRY HOLDS THE SAME RANK IN RELATION TO DIALECTICAL PHILOSOPHY AS THIS SAME PHILOSOPHY HELD FOR MANY CENTURIES IN RELATION TO THEOLOGY: NAMELY, THE RANK OF ANCILIA.1 THIS WAS THE NEW POSITION INTO WHICH PLATO, UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THE DEMONIC SOCRATES, FORCED POETRY.

HERE PHILOSOPHIC THOUGHT OVERGROWS ART AND COMPELS IT TO CLING CLOSE TO THE TRUNK OF DIALECTIC. THE APOLLINIAN TENDENCY HAS WITHDRAWN INTO THE COCOON OF LOGICAL SCHEMATISM; JUST AS IN THE CASE OF EURIPIDES WE NOTICED SOMETHING ANALOGOUS, AS WELL AS A TRANSFORMATION OF THE DIONYSIAN INTO NATURALISTIC AFFECTS. SOCRATES, THE DIALECTICAL HERO OF THE PLATONIC DRAMA, REMINDS US OF THE KINDRED NATURE OF THE EURIPIDEAN HERO WHO MUST DEFEND HIS ACTIONS WITH ARGUMENTS AND COUNTERARGUMENTS AND IN THE PROCESS OFTEN RISKS THE LOSS OF OUR TRAGIC PITY; FOR WHO COULD MISTAKE THE OPTIMISTIC ELEMENT IN THE NATURE OF DIALECTIC, WHICH CELEBRATES A TRIUMPH WITH EVERY CONCLUSION AND CAN BREATHE ONLY IN COOL CLARITY AND CONSCIOUSNESS‚ÄÎTHE OPTIMISTIC ELEMENT WHICH, HAVING ONCE PENETRATED TRAGEDY MUST GRADUALLY OVERGROW ITS DIONYSIAN REGIONS AND IMPEL IT NECESSARILY TO SELF-DESTRUCTION‚ÄÎTO THE DEATH-LEAP INTO THE BOURGEOIS DRAMA. CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE SOCRATIC MAXIMS: ‚ÄÚVIRTUE IS KNOWLEDGE; MAN SINS ONLY FROM IGNORANCE; HE WHO IS VIRTUOUS IS HAPPY.‚ÄÙ IN THESE THREE BASIC FORMS OF OPTIMISM LIES THE DEATH OF TRAGEDY. FOR NOW THE VIRTUOUS HERO MUST BE A DIALECTICIAN; NOW THERE MUST BE A NECESSARY, VISIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN VIRTUE AND KNOWLEDGE, FAITH AND MORALITY; NOW THE TRANSCENDENTAL JUSTICE OF AESCHYLUS IS DEGRADED TO THE SUPERFICIAL AND INSOLENT PRINCIPLE OF ‚ÄÚPOETIC JUSTICE‚ÄÙ WITH ITS CUSTOMARY DEUS EX MACHINA.2

AS IT CONFRONTS THIS NEW SOCRATIC-OPTIMISTIC STAGE WORLD, HOW DOES THE CHORUS APPEAR NOW, AND INDEED THE WHOLE MUSICAL-DIONYSIAN SUBSTRATUM OF TRAGEDY? AS SOMETHING ACCIDENTAL, A DISPENSABLE VESTIGE OF THE ORIGIN OF TRAGEDY; WHILE WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE CHORUS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD ONLY AS THE CAUSE OF TRAGEDY, AND OF THE TRAGIC IN GENERAL. THIS PERPLEXITY IN REGARD TO THE CHORUS ALREADY MANIFESTS ITSELF IN SOPHOCLES‚ÄÎAN IMPORTANT INDICATION THAT EVEN WITH HIM THE DIONYSIAN BASIS OF TRAGEDY IS BEGINNING TO BREAK DOWN. HE NO LONGER DARES TO ENTRUST TO THE CHORUS THE MAIN SHARE OF THE EFFECT, BUT LIMITS ITS SPHERE TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT NOW APPEARS ALMOST CO-ORDINATE WITH THE ACTORS, JUST AS IF IT WERE ELEVATED FROM THE ORCHESTRA INTO THE SCENE; AND THUS ITS CHARACTER IS, OF COURSE, COMPLETELY DESTROYED, EVEN IF ARISTOTLE FAVORS PRECISELY THIS THEORY OF THE CHORUS. THIS ALTERATION IN THE POSITION OF THE CHORUS, WHICH SOPHOCLES AT ANY RATE RECOMMENDED BY HIS PRACTICE AND, ACCORDING TO TRADITION, EVEN BY A TREATISE, IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION OF THE CHORUS, WHOSE PHASES FOLLOW ONE ANOTHER WITH ALARMING RAPIDITY IN EURIPIDES, AGATHON, AND THE NEW COMEDY. OPTIMISTIC DIALECTIC DRIVES MUSIC OUT OF TRAGEDY WITH THE SCOURGE OF ITS SYLLOGISMS; THAT IS, IT DESTROYS THE ESSENCE OF TRAGEDY, WHICH CAN BE INTERPRETED ONLY AS A MANIFESTATION AND PROJECTION INTO IMAGES OF DIONYSIAN STATES, AS THE VISIBLE SYMBOLIZING OF MUSIC, AS THE DREAMWORLD OF A DIONYSIAN INTOXICATION.

IF WE MUST THUS ASSUME AN ANTI-DIONYSIAN TENDENCY OPERATING EVEN PRIOR TO SOCRATES, WHICH MERELY RECEIVED IN HIM AN UNPRECEDENTEDLY MAGNIFICENT EXPRESSION, WE MUST NOT DRAW BACK BEFORE THE QUESTION OF WHAT SUCH A PHENOMENON AS THAT OF SOCRATES INDICATES; FOR IN VIEW OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT ENTITLED TO REGARD IT AS A MERELY DISINTEGRATING, NEGATIVE FORCE. AND THOUGH THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE MOST IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF THE SOCRATIC IMPULSE TENDED TO THE DISSOLUTION OF DIONYSIAN TRAGEDY, YET A PROFOUND EXPERIENCE IN SOCRATES‚ÄÔ OWN LIFE IMPELS US TO ASK WHETHER THERE IS NECESSARILY ONLY AN ANTIPODAL RELATION BETWEEN SOCRATISM AND ART, AND WHETHER THE BIRTH OF AN ‚ÄÚARTISTIC SOCRATES‚ÄÙ IS ALTOGETHER A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS.

FOR WITH RESPECT TO ART THAT DESPOTIC LOGICIAN OCCASIONALLY HAD THE FEELING OF A GAP, A VOID, HALF A REPROACH, A POSSIBLY NEGLECTED DUTY. AS HE TELLS HIS FRIENDS IN PRISON, THERE OFTEN CAME TO HIM ONE AND THE SAME DREAM APPARITION, WHICH ALWAYS SAID THE SAME THING TO HIM: ‚ÄÚSOCRATES, PRACTICE MUSIC.‚ÄÙ UP TO HIS VERY LAST DAYS HE COMFORTS HIMSELF WITH THE VIEW THAT HIS PHILOSOPHIZING IS THE HIGHEST OF THE MUSES, AND HE FINDS IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A DEITY SHOULD REMIND HIM OF THE ‚ÄÚCOMMON, POPULAR MUSIC.‚ÄÙ FINALLY, IN PRISON, IN ORDER THAT HE MAY THOROUGHLY UNBURDEN HIS CONSCIENCE, HE DOES CONSENT TO PRACTICE THIS MUSIC FOR WHICH HE HAS BUT LITTLE RESPECT. AND IN THIS MOOD HE WRITES A PRELUDE TO APOLLO AND TURNS A FEW AESOPIAN FABLES INTO VERSE. IT WAS SOMETHING AKIN TO THE DEMONIC WARNING VOICE THAT URGED HIM TO THESE PRACTICES; IT WAS HIS APOLLINIAN INSIGHT THAT, LIKE A BARBARIC KING, HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE NOBLE IMAGE OF A GOD AND WAS IN DANGER OF SINNING AGAINST A DEITY‚ÄÎTHROUGH HIS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING. THE VOICE OF THE SOCRATIC DREAM VISION IS THE ONLY SIGN OF ANY MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE LIMITS OF LOGIC: PERHAPS‚ÄÎTHUS HE MUST HAVE ASKED HIMSELF‚ÄÎWHAT IS NOT INTELLIGIBLE TO ME IS NOT NECESSARILY UNINTELLIGENT? PERHAPS THERE IS A REALM OF WISDOM FROM WHICH THE LOGICIAN IS EXILED? PERHAPS ART IS EVEN A NECESSARY CORRELATIVE OF, AND SUPPLEMENT FOR SCIENCE?





15


IN THE SPIRIT OF THESE LAST SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS IT MUST NOW BE SAID HOW THE INFLUENCE OF SOCRATES, DOWN TO THE PRESENT MOMENT AND EVEN INTO ALL FUTURE TIME, HAS SPREAD OVER POSTERITY LIKE A SHADOW THAT KEEPS GROWING IN THE EVENING SUN, AND HOW IT AGAIN AND AGAIN PROMPTS A REGENERATION OF ART‚ÄÎOF ART IN THE METAPHYSICAL, BROADEST AND PROFOUNDEST SENSE‚ÄÎAND HOW ITS OWN INFINITY ALSO GUARANTEES THE INFINITY OF ART.

BEFORE THIS COULD BE RECOGNIZED, BEFORE THE INNERMOST DEPENDENCE OF EVERY ART ON THE GREEKS, FROM HOMER TO SOCRATES, WAS DEMONSTRATED CONCLUSIVELY, WE HAD TO FEEL ABOUT THESE GREEKS AS THE ATHENIANS FELT ABOUT SOCRATES. NEARLY EVERY AGE AND STAGE OF CULTURE HAS AT SOME TIME OR OTHER SOUGHT WITH PROFOUND IRRITATION TO FREE ITSELF FROM THE GREEKS, BECAUSE IN THEIR PRESENCE EVERYTHING ONE HAS ACHIEVED ONESELF, THOUGH APPARENTLY QUITE ORIGINAL AND SINCERELY ADMIRED, SUDDENLY SEEMED TO LOSE LIFE AND COLOR AND SHRIVELED INTO A POOR COPY, EVEN A CARICATURE. AND SO TIME AFTER TIME CORDIAL ANGER ERUPTS AGAINST THIS PRESUMPTUOUS LITTLE PEOPLE THAT MADE BOLD FOR ALL TIME TO DESIGNATE EVERYTHING NOT NATIVE AS ‚ÄÚBARBARIC.‚ÄÙ WHO ARE THEY, ONE ASKS, WHO, THOUGH THEY DISPLAY ONLY AN EPHEMERAL HISTORICAL SPLENDOR, RIDICULOUSLY RESTRICTED INSTITUTIONS, A DUBIOUS EXCELLENCE IN THEIR MORES, AND ARE MARKED BY UGLY VICES, YET LAY CLAIM TO THAT DIGNITY AND PRE-EMINENCE AMONG PEOPLES WHICH CHARACTERIZE GENIUS AMONG THE MASSES? UNFORTUNATELY, ONE WAS NOT LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND THE CUP OF HEMLOCK WITH WHICH ONE COULD SIMPLY DISPOSE OF SUCH A CHARACTER; FOR ALL THE POISON THAT ENVY, CALUMNY, AND RANCOR CREATED DID NOT SUFFICE TO DESTROY THAT SELF-SUFFICIENT SPLENDOR. AND SO ONE FEELS ASHAMED AND AFRAID IN THE PRESENCE OF THE GREEKS, UNLESS ONE PRIZES TRUTH ABOVE ALL THINGS AND DARES ACKNOWLEDGE EVEN THIS TRUTH: THAT THE GREEKS, AS CHARIOTEERS, HOLD IN THEIR HANDS THE REINS OF OUR OWN AND EVERY OTHER CULTURE, BUT THAT ALMOST ALWAYS CHARIOT AND HORSES ARE OF INFERIOR QUALITY AND NOT UP TO THE GLORY OF THEIR LEADERS, WHO CONSIDER IT SPORT TO RUN SUCH A TEAM INTO AN ABYSS WHICH THEY THEMSELVES CLEAR WITH THE LEAP OF ACHILLES.

IN ORDER TO VINDICATE THE DIGNITY OF SUCH A LEADER‚ÄÔS POSITION FOR SOCRATES, TOO, IT IS ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE IN HIM A TYPE OF EXISTENCE UNHEARD OF BEFORE HIM: THE TYPE OF THE THEORETICAL MAN WHOSE SIGNIFICANCE AND AIM IT IS OUR NEXT TASK TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND. LIKE THE ARTIST, THE THEORETICAL MAN FINDS AN INFINITE DELIGHT IN WHATEVER EXISTS, AND THIS SATISFACTION PROTECTS HIM AGAINST THE PRACTICAL ETHICS OF PESSIMISM WITH ITS LYNCEUS EYES1 THAT SHINE ONLY IN THE DARK. WHENEVER THE TRUTH IS UNCOVERED, THE ARTIST WILL ALWAYS CLING WITH RAPT GAZE TO WHAT STILL REMAINS COVERING2 EVEN AFTER SUCH UNCOVERING; BUT THE THEORETICAL MAN ENJOYS AND FINDS SATISFACTION IN THE DISCARDED COVERING AND FINDS THE HIGHEST OBJECT OF HIS PLEASURE IN THE PROCESS OF AN EVER HAPPY UNCOVERING THAT SUCCEEDS THROUGH HIS OWN EFFORTS.

THERE WOULD BE NO SCIENCE IF IT WERE CONCERNED ONLY WITH THAT ONE NUDE GODDESS AND WITH NOTHING ELSE. FOR IN THAT CASE HER DEVOTEES WOULD HAVE TO FEEL LIKE MEN WHO WANTED TO DIG A HOLE STRAIGHT THROUGH THE EARTH, ASSUMING THAT EACH OF THEM REALIZED THAT EVEN IF HE TRIED HIS UTMOST, HIS WHOLE LIFE LONG, HE WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO DIG A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THIS ENORMOUS DEPTH, AND EVEN THAT WOULD BE FILLED IN AGAIN BEFORE HIS OWN EYES BY THE LABORS OF THE NEXT IN LINE, SO A THIRD PERSON WOULD SEEM TO DO WELL IF HE PICKED A NEW SPOT FOR HIS DRILLING EFFORTS. NOW SUPPOSE SOMEONE PROVED CONVINCINGLY THAT THE GOAL OF THE ANTIPODES CANNOT BE REACHED IN THIS DIRECT MANNER: WHO WOULD STILL WISH TO GO ON WORKING IN THESE OLD DEPTHS, UNLESS HE HAD LEARNED MEANWHILE TO BE SATISFIED WITH FINDING PRECIOUS STONES OR DISCOVERING LAWS OF NATURE?

THEREFORE LESSING, THE MOST HONEST THEORETICAL MAN, DARED TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE CARED MORE FOR THE SEARCH AFTER TRUTH THAN FOR TRUTH ITSELF3‚ÄÎAND THUS REVEALED THE FUNDAMENTAL SECRET OF SCIENCE, TO THE ASTONISHMENT, AND INDEED THE ANGER, OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY. BESIDE THIS ISOLATED INSIGHT, BORN OF AN EXCESS OF HONESTY IF NOT OF EXUBERANCE, THERE IS, TO BE SURE, A PROFOUND ILLUSION THAT FIRST SAW THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD IN THE PERSON OF SOCRATES: THE UNSHAKABLE FAITH THAT THOUGHT, USING THE THREAD OF CAUSALITY, CAN PENETRATE THE DEEPEST ABYSSES OF BEING, AND THAT THOUGHT IS CAPABLE NOT ONLY OF KNOWING BEING BUT EVEN OF CORRECTING IT. THIS SUBLIME METAPHYSICAL ILLUSION ACCOMPANIES SCIENCE AS AN INSTINCT AND LEADS SCIENCE AGAIN AND AGAIN TO ITS LIMITS AT WHICH IT MUST TURN INTO ART‚ÄÎWHICH IS REALLY THE AIM OF THIS MECHANISM.

WITH THE TORCH OF THIS THOUGHT IN OUR HANDS, LET US NOW LOOK AT SOCRATES: HE APPEARS TO US AS THE FIRST WHO COULD NOT ONLY LIVE, GUIDED BY THIS INSTINCT OF SCIENCE, BUT ALSO‚ÄÎAND THIS IS FAR MORE‚ÄÎDIE THAT WAY. HENCE THE IMAGE OF THE DYING SOCRATES, AS THE HUMAN BEING WHOM KNOWLEDGE AND REASONS HAVE LIBERATED FROM THE FEAR OF DEATH, IS THE EMBLEM THAT, ABOVE THE ENTRANCE GATE OF SCIENCE, REMINDS ALL OF ITS MISSION‚ÄÎNAMELY, TO MAKE EXISTENCE APPEAR COMPREHENSIBLE AND THUS JUSTIFIED; AND IF REASONS DO NOT SUFFICE, MYTH HAS TO COME TO THEIR AID IN THE END‚ÄÎMYTH WHICH I HAVE JUST CALLED THE NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE, INDEED THE PURPOSE, OF SCIENCE.

ONCE WE SEE CLEARLY HOW AFTER SOCRATES, THE MYSTAGOGUE OF SCIENCE, ONE PHILOSOPHICAL SCHOOL SUCCEEDS ANOTHER, WAVE UPON WAVE; HOW THE HUNGER FOR KNOWLEDGE REACHED A NEVER-SUSPECTED UNIVERSALITY IN THE WIDEST DOMAIN OF THE EDUCATED WORLD, BECAME THE REAL TASK FOR EVERY PERSON OF HIGHER GIFTS, AND LED SCIENCE ONTO THE HIGH SEAS FROM WHICH IT HAS NEVER AGAIN BEEN DRIVEN ALTOGETHER; HOW THIS UNIVERSALITY FIRST SPREAD A COMMON NET OF THOUGHT OVER THE WHOLE GLOBE, ACTUALLY HOLDING OUT THE PROSPECT OF THE LAWFULNESS OF AN ENTIRE SOLAR SYSTEM; ONCE WE SEE ALL THIS CLEARLY, ALONG WITH THE AMAZINGLY HIGH PYRAMID OF KNOWLEDGE IN OUR OWN TIME‚ÄÎWE CANNOT FAIL TO SEE IN SOCRATES THE ONE TURNING POINT AND VORTEX OF SO-CALLED WORLD HISTORY. FOR IF WE IMAGINE THAT THE WHOLE INCALCULABLE SUM OF ENERGY USED UP FOR THIS WORLD TENDENCY HAD BEEN USED NOT IN THE SERVICE OF KNOWLEDGE BUT FOR THE PRACTICAL, I.E., EGOISTIC AIMS OF INDIVIDUALS AND PEOPLES, THEN WE REALIZE THAT IN THAT CASE UNIVERSAL WARS OF ANNIHILATION AND CONTINUAL MIGRATIONS OF PEOPLES WOULD PROBABLY HAVE WEAKENED THE INSTINCTIVE LUST FOR LIFE TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT SUICIDE WOULD HAVE BECOME A GENERAL CUSTOM AND INDIVIDUALS MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCED THE FINAL REMNANT OF A SENSE OF DUTY WHEN, LIKE THE INHABITANTS OF THE FIJI ISLANDS, THEY HAD STRANGLED THEIR PARENTS AND FRIENDS‚ÄÎA PRACTICAL PESSIMISM THAT MIGHT EVEN HAVE GENERATED A GRUESOME ETHIC OF GENOCIDE4 MOTIVATED BY PITY, AND WHICH INCIDENTALLY IS, AND WAS, PRESENT IN THE WORLD WHEREVER ART DID NOT APPEAR IN SOME FORM‚ÄÎESPECIALLY AS RELIGION AND SCIENCE‚ÄÎAS A REMEDY AND A PREVENTIVE FOR THIS BREATH OF PESTILENCE.

BY CONTRAST WITH THIS PRACTICAL PESSIMISM, SOCRATES IS THE PROTOTYPE OF THE THEORETICAL OPTIMIST WHO, WITH HIS FAITH THAT THE NATURE OF THINGS CAN BE FATHOMED, ASCRIBES TO KNOWLEDGE AND INSIGHT THE POWER OF A PANACEA, WHILE UNDERSTANDING ERROR AS THE EVIL PAR EXCELLENCE. TO FATHOM THE DEPTHS AND TO SEPARATE TRUE KNOWLEDGE FROM APPEARANCE AND ERROR, SEEMED TO SOCRATIC MAN THE NOBLEST, EVEN THE ONLY TRULY HUMAN VOCATION. AND SINCE SOCRATES, THIS MECHANISM OF CONCEPTS, JUDGMENTS, AND INFERENCES HAS BEEN ESTEEMED AS THE HIGHEST OCCUPATION AND THE MOST ADMIRABLE GIFT OF NATURE, ABOVE ALL OTHER CAPACITIES. EVEN THE MOST SUBLIME ETHICAL DEEDS, THE STIRRINGS OF PITY, SELF-SACRIFICE, HEROISM, AND THAT CALM SEA OF THE SOUL, SO DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN, WHICH THE APOLLINIAN GREEK CALLED SOPHROSUNE,5 WERE DERIVED FROM THE DIALECTIC OF KNOWLEDGE BY SOCRATES AND HIS LIKE-MINDED SUCCESSORS, DOWN TO THE PRESENT, AND ACCORDINGLY DESIGNATED AS TEACHABLE.

ANYONE WHO HAS EVER EXPERIENCED THE PLEASURE OF SOCRATIC INSIGHT AND FELT HOW, SPREADING IN EVER-WIDENING CIRCLES, IT SEEKS TO EMBRACE THE WHOLE WORLD OF APPEARANCES, WILL NEVER AGAIN FIND ANY STIMULUS TOWARD EXISTENCE MORE VIOLENT THAN THE CRAVING TO COMPLETE THIS CONQUEST AND TO WEAVE THE NET IMPENETRABLY TIGHT. TO ONE WHO FEELS THAT WAY, THE PLATONIC SOCRATES WILL APPEAR AS THE TEACHER OF AN ALTOGETHER NEW FORM OF ‚ÄÚGREEK CHEERFULNESS‚ÄÙ AND BLISSFUL AFFIRMATION OF EXISTENCE THAT SEEKS TO DISCHARGE ITSELF IN ACTIONS‚ÄÎMOST OFTEN IN MAIEUTIC AND EDUCATIONAL INFLUENCES ON NOBLE YOUTHS, WITH A VIEW TO EVENTUALLY PRODUCING A GENIUS.

BUT SCIENCE, SPURRED BY ITS POWERFUL ILLUSION, SPEEDS IRRESISTIBLY TOWARD ITS LIMITS WHERE ITS OPTIMISM, CONCEALED IN THE ESSENCE OF LOGIC, SUFFERS SHIPWRECK. FOR THE PERIPHERY OF THE CIRCLE OF SCIENCE HAS AN INFINITE NUMBER OF POINTS; AND WHILE THERE IS NO TELLING HOW THIS CIRCLE COULD EVER BE SURVEYED COMPLETELY, NOBLE AND GIFTED MEN NEVERTHELESS REACH, E‚ÄÔER HALF THEIR TIME6 AND INEVITABLY, SUCH BOUNDARY POINTS7 ON THE PERIPHERY FROM WHICH ONE GAZES INTO WHAT DEFIES ILLUMINATION. WHEN THEY SEE TO THEIR HORROR HOW LOGIC COILS UP AT THESE BOUNDARIES AND FINALLY BITES ITS OWN TAIL‚ÄÎSUDDENLY THE NEW FORM OF INSIGHT BREAKS THROUGH, TRAGIC INSIGHT WHICH, MERELY TO BE ENDURED, NEEDS ART AS A PROTECTION AND REMEDY.

OUR EYES STRENGTHENED AND REFRESHED BY OUR CONTEMPLATION OF THE GREEKS, LET US LOOK AT THE HIGHEST SPHERES OF THE WORLD AROUND US; THEN WE SHALL SEE HOW THE HUNGER FOR INSATIABLE AND OPTIMISTIC KNOWLEDGE8 THAT IN SOCRATES APPEARS EXEMPLARY HAS TURNED INTO TRAGIC RESIGNATION AND DESTITUTE NEED FOR ART‚ÄÎWHILE, TO BE SURE, THE SAME HUNGER ON ITS LOWER LEVELS CAN EXPRESS ITSELF IN HOSTILITY TO ART AND MUST PARTICULARLY DETEST DIONYSIAN-TRAGIC ART, AS WAS ILLUSTRATED EARLIER WITH THE FIGHT OF SOCRATISM AGAINST AESCHYLEAN TRAGEDY.

HERE WE KNOCK, DEEPLY MOVED, AT THE GATES OF PRESENT AND FUTURE: WILL THIS ‚ÄÚTURNING‚ÄÙ9 LEAD TO EVER-NEW CONFIGURATIONS OF GENIUS AND ESPECIALLY OF THE SOCRATES WHO PRACTICES MUSIC?10 WILL THE NET OF ART, EVEN IF IT IS CALLED RELIGION OR SCIENCE, THAT IS SPREAD OVER EXISTENCE BE WOVEN EVEN MORE TIGHTLY AND DELICATELY, OR IS IT DESTINED TO BE TORN TO SHREDS IN THE RESTLESS, BARBAROUS, CHAOTIC WHIRL THAT NOW CALLS ITSELF ‚ÄÚTHE PRESENT‚ÄÙ?

CONCERNED BUT NOT DISCONSOLATE, WE STAND ASIDE A LITTLE WHILE, CONTEMPLATIVE MEN TO WHOM IT HAS BEEN GRANTED TO BE WITNESSES OF THESE TREMENDOUS STRUGGLES AND TRANSITIONS. ALAS, IT IS THE MAGIC OF THESE STRUGGLES THAT THOSE WHO BEHOLD THEM MUST ALSO TAKE PART AND FIGHT.11

BY THIS ELABORATE HISTORICAL EXAMPLE WE HAVE SOUGHT TO MAKE CLEAR HOW JUST AS TRAGEDY PERISHES WITH THE EVANESCENCE OF THE SPIRIT OF MUSIC, IT IS ONLY FROM THIS SPIRIT THAT IT CAN BE REBORN. LEST THIS ASSERTION SEEM TOO STRANGE, IT MAY BE WELL TO DISCLOSE THE ORIGIN OF THIS INSIGHT BY CONSIDERING THE ANALOGOUS PHENOMENA OF OUR OWN TIME; WE MUST ENTER INTO THE MIDST OF THOSE STRUGGLES, WHICH, AS I HAVE JUST SAID, ARE BEING WAGED IN THE HIGHEST SPHERES OF OUR CONTEMPORARY WORLD BETWEEN INSATIABLE OPTIMISTIC KNOWLEDGE AND THE TRAGIC NEED OF ART. IN MY EXAMINATION I SHALL LEAVE OUT OF ACCOUNT ALL THOSE OTHER ANTAGONISTIC TENDENCIES WHICH AT ALL TIMES OPPOSE ART, ESPECIALLY TRAGEDY, AND WHICH NOW ARE AGAIN EXTENDING THEIR TRIUMPHANT SWAY TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT OF THE THEATRICAL ARTS ONLY THE FARCE AND THE BALLET, FOR EXAMPLE, PUT FORTH THEIR BLOSSOMS, WHICH PERHAPS NOT EVERYONE CARES TO SMELL, IN RATHER RICH LUXURIANCE. I WILL SPEAK ONLY OF THE NOBLEST OPPOSITION TO THE TRAGIC WORLD-CONCEPTION‚ÄÎAND BY THIS I MEAN SCIENCE, WHICH IS AT BOTTOM OPTIMISTIC, WITH ITS ANCESTOR SOCRATES AT ITS HEAD. A LITTLE LATER ON I SHALL ALSO NAME THOSE FORCES WHICH SEEM TO ME TO GUARANTEE A REBIRTH OF TRAGEDY‚ÄÎAND PERHAPS OTHER BLESSED HOPES FOR THE GERMAN GENIUS!

BEFORE WE PLUNGE INTO THE MIDST OF THESE STRUGGLES, LET US ARRAY OURSELVES IN THE ARMOR OF THE INSIGHTS WE HAVE ACQUIRED. IN CONTRAST TO ALL THOSE WHO ARE INTENT ON DERIVING THE ARTS FROM ONE EXCLUSIVE PRINCIPLE, AS THE NECESSARY VITAL SOURCE OF EVERY WORK OF ART, I SHALL KEEP MY EYES FIXED ON THE TWO ARTISTIC DEITIES OF THE GREEKS, APOLLO AND DIONYSUS, AND RECOGNIZE IN THEM THE LIVING AND CONSPICUOUS REPRESENTATIVES OF TWO WORLDS OF ART DIFFERING IN THEIR INTRINSIC ESSENCE AND IN THEIR HIGHEST AIMS. I SEE APOLLO AS THE TRANSFIGURING GENIUS OF THE PRINCIPIUM INDIVIDUATIONIS THROUGH WHICH ALONE THE REDEMPTION IN ILLUSION IS TRULY TO BE OBTAINED; WHILE BY THE MYSTICAL TRIUMPHANT CRY OF DIONYSUS THE SPELL OF INDIVIDUATION IS BROKEN, AND THE WAY LIES OPEN TO THE MOTHERS OF BEING,1 TO THE INNERMOST HEART OF THINGS. THIS EXTRAORDINARY CONTRAST, WHICH STRETCHES LIKE A YAWNING GULF BETWEEN PLASTIC ART AS THE APOLLINIAN, AND MUSIC AS THE DIONYSIAN ART,2 HAS REVEALED ITSELF TO ONLY ONE OF THE GREAT THINKERS, TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT, EVEN WITHOUT THIS CLUE TO THE SYMBOLISM OF THE HELLENIC DIVINITIES, HE CONCEDED TO MUSIC A CHARACTER AND AN ORIGIN DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE OTHER ARTS, BECAUSE, UNLIKE THEM, IT IS NOT A COPY OF THE PHENOMENON, BUT AN IMMEDIATE COPY OF THE WILL ITSELF, AND THEREFORE COMPLEMENTS EVERYTHING PHYSICAL IN THE WORLD AND EVERY PHENOMENON BY REPRESENTING WHAT IS METAPHYSICAL, THE THING IN ITSELF. (SCHOPENHAUER, WELT ALS WILLE UND VORSTELLUNG, I.)

TO THIS MOST IMPORTANT INSIGHT OF AESTHETICS (WITH WHICH, IN THE MOST SERIOUS SENSE, AESTHETICS PROPERLY BEGINS), RICHARD WAGNER, BY WAY OF CONFIRMATION OF ITS ETERNAL TRUTH, AFFIXED HIS SEAL, WHEN HE ASSERTED IN HIS BEETHOVEN THAT MUSIC MUST BE EVALUATED ACCORDING TO AESTHETIC PRINCIPLES QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WHICH APPLY TO ALL PLASTIC ARTS, AND NOT, IN GENERAL, ACCORDING TO THE CATEGORY OF BEAUTY; ALTHOUGH AN ERRONEOUS AESTHETICS, INSPIRED BY A MISTAKEN AND DEGENERATE ART,3 HAS, BY VIRTUE OF THE CONCEPT OF BEAUTY OBTAINING IN THE PLASTIC DOMAIN, ACCUSTOMED ITSELF TO DEMAND OF MUSIC AN EFFECT SIMILAR TO THAT PRODUCED BY WORKS OF PLASTIC ART, NAMELY, THE AROUSING OF DELIGHT IN BEAUTIFUL FORMS. HAVING RECOGNIZED THIS EXTRAORDINARY CONTRAST, I FELT A STRONG NEED TO APPROACH THE ESSENCE OF GREEK TRAGEDY AND, WITH IT, THE PROFOUNDEST REVELATION OF THE HELLENIC GENIUS; FOR I AT LAST THOUGHT THAT I POSSESSED A CHARM TO ENABLE ME‚ÄÎFAR BEYOND THE PHRASEOLOGY OF OUR USUAL AESTHETICS‚ÄÎTO REPRESENT VIVIDLY TO MY MIND THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM OF TRAGEDY; WHEREBY I WAS GRANTED SUCH A SURPRISING AND UNUSUAL INSIGHT INTO THE HELLENIC CHARACTER THAT IT NECESSARILY SEEMED TO ME AS IF OUR CLASSICAL-HELLENIC SCIENCE THAT BEARS ITSELF SO PROUDLY HAD THUS FAR CONTRIVED TO SUBSIST MAINLY ON SHADOW PLAYS AND EXTERNALS.

PERHAPS WE MAY TOUCH ON THIS FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM BY ASKING: WHAT AESTHETIC EFFECT RESULTS WHEN THE ESSENTIALLY SEPARATE ART-FORCES, THE APOLLINIAN AND THE DIONYSIAN, ENTER INTO SIMULTANEOUS ACTIVITY? OR MORE BRIEFLY: HOW IS MUSIC RELATED TO IMAGE AND CONCEPT? SCHOPENHAUER, WHOM RICHARD WAGNER, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THIS POINT, PRAISES FOR AN UNSURPASSABLE CLEARNESS AND CLARITY OF EXPOSITION, EXPRESSES HIMSELF MOST THOROUGHLY ON THE SUBJECT IN THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE WHICH I SHALL CITE HERE AT FULL LENGTH (WELT ALS WILLE UND VORSTELLUNG, I4): ‚ÄÚACCORDING TO ALL THIS, WE MAY REGARD THE PHENOMENAL WORLD, OR NATURE, AND MUSIC AS TWO DIFFERENT EXPRESSIONS OF THE SAME THING,5 WHICH IS THEREFORE ITSELF THE ONLY MEDIUM OF THEIR ANALOGY, SO THAT A KNOWLEDGE OF IT IS DEMANDED IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THAT ANALOGY. MUSIC, THEREFORE, IF REGARDED AS AN EXPRESSION OF THE WORLD, IS IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE, WHICH IS RELATED INDEED TO THE UNIVERSALITY OF CONCEPTS, MUCH AS THEY ARE RELATED TO THE PARTICULAR THINGS. ITS UNIVERSALITY, HOWEVER, IS BY NO MEANS THAT EMPTY UNIVERSALITY OF ABSTRACTION, BUT OF QUITE A DIFFERENT KIND, AND IS UNITED WITH THOROUGH AND DISTINCT DEFINITENESS. IN THIS RESPECT IT RESEMBLES GEOMETRICAL FIGURES AND NUMBERS, WHICH ARE THE UNIVERSAL FORMS OF ALL POSSIBLE OBJECTS OF EXPERIENCE AND APPLICABLE TO THEM ALL A PRIORI, AND YET ARE NOT ABSTRACT BUT PERCEPTIBLE AND THOROUGHLY DETERMINATE. ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS, EXCITEMENTS, AND MANIFESTATIONS OF WILL, ALL THAT GOES ON IN THE HEART OF MAN AND THAT REASON INCLUDES IN THE WIDE, NEGATIVE CONCEPT OF FEELING, MAY BE EXPRESSED BY THE INFINITE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE MELODIES, BUT ALWAYS IN THE UNIVERSAL, IN THE MERE FORM, WITHOUT THE MATERIAL, ALWAYS ACCORDING TO THE THING-IN-ITSELF, NOT THE PHENOMENON, THE INMOST SOUL, AS IT WERE, OF THE PHENOMENON WITHOUT THE BODY. THIS DEEP RELATION WHICH MUSIC HAS TO THE TRUE NATURE OF ALL THINGS ALSO EXPLAINS THE FACT THAT SUITABLE MUSIC PLAYED TO ANY SCENE, ACTION, EVENT, OR SURROUNDING SEEMS TO DISCLOSE TO US ITS MOST SECRET MEANING, AND APPEARS AS THE MOST ACCURATE AND DISTINCT COMMENTARY UPON IT. THIS IS SO TRULY THE CASE THAT WHOEVER GIVES HIMSELF UP ENTIRELY TO THE IMPRESSION OF A SYMPHONY, SEEMS TO SEE ALL THE POSSIBLE EVENTS OF LIFE AND THE WORLD TAKE PLACE IN HIMSELF; YET IF HE REFLECTS, HE CAN FIND NO LIKENESS BETWEEN THE MUSIC AND THE THINGS THAT PASSED BEFORE HIS MIND. FOR, AS WE HAVE SAID, MUSIC IS DISTINGUISHED FROM ALL THE OTHER ARTS BY THE FACT THAT IT IS NOT A COPY OF THE PHENOMENON, OR, MORE ACCURATELY, OF THE ADEQUATE OBJECTIVITY OF THE WILL, BUT AN IMMEDIATE COPY OF THE WILL ITSELF, AND THEREFORE COMPLEMENTS EVERYTHING PHYSICAL IN THE WORLD AND EVERY PHENOMENON BY REPRESENTING WHAT IS METAPHYSICAL, THE THING IN ITSELF. WE MIGHT, THEREFORE, JUST AS WELL CALL THE WORLD EMBODIED MUSIC AS EMBODIED WILL; AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY MUSIC MAKES EVERY PAINTING, AND INDEED EVERY SCENE OF REAL LIFE AND OF THE WORLD, AT ONCE APPEAR WITH HIGHER SIGNIFICANCE, CERTAINLY ALL THE MORE, IN PROPORTION AS ITS MELODY IS ANALOGOUS TO THE INNER SPIRIT OF THE GIVEN PHENOMENON. THEREFORE WE ARE ABLE TO SET A POEM TO MUSIC AS A SONG, OR A VISIBLE REPRESENTATION AS A PANTOMIME, OR BOTH AS AN OPERA. SUCH PARTICULAR PICTURES OF HUMAN LIFE, SET TO THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE OF MUSIC, ARE NEVER BOUND TO IT OR CORRESPOND TO IT WITH STRINGENT NECESSITY; BUT THEY STAND TO IT ONLY IN THE RELATION OF AN EXAMPLE CHOSEN AT WILL TO A GENERAL CONCEPT. IN THE DETERMINATENESS OF THE REAL, THEY REPRESENT THAT WHICH MUSIC EXPRESSES IN THE UNIVERSALITY OF MERE FORM. FOR MELODIES ARE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, LIKE GENERAL CONCEPTS, AN ABSTRACTION FROM THE ACTUAL. THIS ACTUAL WORLD, THEN, THE WORLD OF PARTICULAR THINGS, AFFORDS THE OBJECT OF PERCEPTION, THE SPECIAL AND INDIVIDUAL, THE PARTICULAR CASE, BOTH TO THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE CONCEPTS AND TO THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE MELODIES. BUT THESE TWO UNIVERSALITIES ARE IN A CERTAIN RESPECT OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER; FOR THE CONCEPTS CONTAIN PARTICULARS ONLY AS THE FIRST FORMS ABSTRACTED FROM PERCEPTION, AS IT WERE, THE SEPARATED SHELL OF THINGS; THUS THEY ARE, STRICTLY SPEAKING, ABSTRACTA: MUSIC, ON THE OTHER HAND, GIVES THE INMOST KERNEL WHICH PRECEDES ALL FORMS, OR THE HEART OF THINGS. THIS RELATION MAY BE VERY WELL EXPRESSED IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE SCHOOLMEN, BY SAYING, THE CONCEPTS ARE THE UNIVERSALIA POST REM, BUT MUSIC GIVES THE UNIVERSALIA ANTE REM, AND THE REAL WORLD THE UNIVERSALIA IN RE. BUT THAT IN GENERAL A RELATION IS POSSIBLE BETWEEN A COMPOSITION AND A VISIBLE REPRESENTATION RESTS, AS WE HAVE SAID, UPON THE FACT THAT BOTH ARE SIMPLY DIFFERENT EXPRESSIONS OF THE SAME INNER BEING OF THE WORLD. WHEN NOW, IN THE PARTICULAR CASE, SUCH A RELATION IS ACTUALLY GIVEN, THAT IS TO SAY, WHEN THE COMPOSER HAS BEEN ABLE TO EXPRESS IN THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE OF MUSIC THE STIRRINGS OF WILL WHICH CONSTITUTE THE HEART OF AN EVENT, THEN THE MELODY OF THE SONG, THE MUSIC OF THE OPERA, IS EXPRESSIVE. BUT THE ANALOGY DISCOVERED BY THE COMPOSER BETWEEN THE TWO MUST HAVE PROCEEDED FROM THE DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE OF THE WORLD UNKNOWN TO HIS REASON, AND MUST NOT BE AN IMITATION PRODUCED WITH CONSCIOUS INTENTION BY MEANS OF CONCEPTS, OTHERWISE THE MUSIC DOES NOT EXPRESS THE INNER NATURE, THE WILL ITSELF, BUT MERELY GIVES AN INADEQUATE IMITATION OF ITS PHENOMENON. ALL TRULY IMITATIVE MUSIC DOES THIS.‚ÄÙ

ACCORDING TO THE DOCTRINE OF SCHOPENHAUER, THEREFORE, WE UNDERSTAND MUSIC AS THE IMMEDIATE LANGUAGE OF THE WILL, AND WE FEEL OUR FANCY STIMULATED TO GIVE FORM TO THIS INVISIBLE AND YET SO ACTIVELY STIRRED SPIRIT-WORLD WHICH SPEAKS TO US, AND WE FEEL PROMPTED TO EMBODY IT IN AN ANALOGOUS EXAMPLE. ON THE OTHER HAND, IMAGE AND CONCEPT, UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A TRULY CORRESPONDING MUSIC, ACQUIRE A HIGHER SIGNIFICANCE. DIONYSIAN ART THEREFORE IS WONT TO EXERCISE TWO KINDS OF INFLUENCES ON THE APOLLINIAN ART FACULTY: MUSIC INCITES TO THE SYMBOLIC INTUITION OF DIONYSIAN UNIVERSALITY, AND MUSIC ALLOWS THE SYMBOLIC IMAGE TO EMERGE IN ITS HIGHEST SIGNIFICANCE. FROM THESE FACTS, INTELLIGIBLE IN THEMSELVES AND NOT INACCESSIBLE TO A MORE PENETRATING EXAMINATION, I INFER THE CAPACITY OF MUSIC TO GIVE BIRTH TO MYTH (THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EXAMPLE), AND PARTICULARLY THE TRAGIC MYTH: THE MYTH WHICH EXPRESSES DIONYSIAN KNOWLEDGE IN SYMBOLS. IN THE PHENOMENON OF THE LYRIST, I HAVE SHOWN HOW MUSIC STRIVES TO EXPRESS ITS NATURE IN APOLLINIAN IMAGES. IF NOW WE REFLECT THAT MUSIC AT ITS HIGHEST STAGE MUST SEEK TO ATTAIN ALSO TO ITS HIGHEST OBJECTIFICATION IN IMAGES, WE MUST DEEM IT POSSIBLE THAT IT ALSO KNOWS HOW TO FIND THE SYMBOLIC EXPRESSION FOR ITS UNIQUE DIONYSIAN WISDOM; AND WHERE SHALL WE SEEK FOR THIS EXPRESSION IF NOT IN TRAGEDY AND, IN GENERAL, IN THE CONCEPTION OF THE TRAGIC?

FROM THE NATURE OF ART AS IT IS USUALLY CONCEIVED ACCORDING TO THE SINGLE CATEGORY OF APPEARANCE AND BEAUTY, THE TRAGIC CANNOT HONESTLY BE DEDUCED AT ALL; IT IS ONLY THROUGH THE SPIRIT OF MUSIC THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE JOY INVOLVED IN THE ANNIHILATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL. FOR IT IS ONLY IN PARTICULAR EXAMPLES OF SUCH ANNIHILATION THAT WE SEE CLEARLY THE ETERNAL PHENOMENON OF DIONYSIAN ART, WHICH GIVES EXPRESSION TO THE WILL IN ITS OMNIPOTENCE, AS IT WERE, BEHIND THE PRINCIPIUM INDIVIDUATIONIS, THE ETERNAL LIFE BEYOND ALL PHENOMENA, AND DESPITE ALL ANNIHILATION. THE METAPHYSICAL JOY IN THE TRAGIC IS A TRANSLATION OF THE INSTINCTIVE UNCONSCIOUS DIONYSIAN WISDOM INTO THE LANGUAGE OF IMAGES: THE HERO, THE HIGHEST MANIFESTATION OF THE WILL, IS NEGATED FOR OUR PLEASURE, BECAUSE HE IS ONLY PHENOMENON, AND BECAUSE THE ETERNAL LIFE OF THE WILL IS NOT AFFECTED BY HIS ANNIHILATION. ‚ÄÚWE BELIEVE IN ETERNAL LIFE,‚ÄÙ EXCLAIMS TRAGEDY; WHILE MUSIC IS THE IMMEDIATE IDEA OF THIS LIFE. PLASTIC ART HAS AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT AIM: HERE APOLLO OVERCOMES THE SUFFERING OF THE INDIVIDUAL BY THE RADIANT GLORIFICATION OF THE ETERNITY OF THE PHENOMENON: HERE BEAUTY TRIUMPHS OVER THE SUFFERING INHERENT IN LIFE; PAIN IS OBLITERATED BY LIES FROM THE FEATURES OF NATURE. IN DIONYSIAN ART AND ITS TRAGIC SYMBOLISM THE SAME NATURE CRIES TO US WITH ITS TRUE, UNDISSEMBLED VOICE: ‚ÄÚBE AS I AM! AMID THE CEASELESS FLUX OF PHENOMENA I AM THE ETERNALLY CREATIVE PRIMORDIAL MOTHER, ETERNALLY IMPELLING TO EXISTENCE, ETERNALLY FINDING SATISFACTION IN THIS CHANGE OF PHENOMENA!‚ÄÙ





17


DIONYSIAN ART, TOO, WISHES TO CONVINCE US OF THE ETERNAL JOY OF EXISTENCE: ONLY WE ARE TO SEEK THIS JOY NOT IN PHENOMENA, BUT BEHIND THEM. WE ARE TO RECOGNIZE THAT ALL THAT COMES INTO BEING MUST BE READY FOR A SORROWFUL END; WE ARE FORCED TO LOOK INTO THE TERRORS OF THE INDIVIDUAL EXISTENCE‚ÄÎYET WE ARE NOT TO BECOME RIGID WITH FEAR: A METAPHYSICAL COMFORT TEARS US MOMENTARILY FROM THE BUSTLE OF THE CHANGING FIGURES. WE ARE REALLY FOR A BRIEF MOMENT PRIMORDIAL BEING ITSELF, FEELING ITS RAGING DESIRE FOR EXISTENCE AND JOY IN EXISTENCE; THE STRUGGLE, THE PAIN, THE DESTRUCTION OF PHENOMENA, NOW APPEAR NECESSARY TO US, IN VIEW OF THE EXCESS OF COUNTLESS FORMS OF EXISTENCE WHICH FORCE AND PUSH ONE ANOTHER INTO LIFE, IN VIEW OF THE EXUBERANT FERTILITY OF THE UNIVERSAL WILL. WE ARE PIERCED BY THE MADDENING STING OF THESE PAINS JUST WHEN WE HAVE BECOME, AS IT WERE, ONE WITH THE INFINITE PRIMORDIAL JOY IN EXISTENCE, AND WHEN WE ANTICIPATE, IN DIONYSIAN ECSTASY, THE INDESTRUCTIBILITY AND ETERNITY OF THIS JOY. IN SPITE OF FEAR AND PITY, WE ARE THE HAPPY LIVING BEINGS, NOT AS INDIVIDUALS, BUT AS THE ONE LIVING BEING, WITH WHOSE CREATIVE JOY WE ARE UNITED.

THE HISTORY OF THE RISE OF GREEK TRAGEDY NOW TELLS US WITH LUMINOUS PRECISION HOW THE TRAGIC ART OF THE GREEKS WAS REALLY BORN OF THE SPIRIT OF MUSIC. WITH THIS CONCEPTION WE BELIEVE WE HAVE DONE JUSTICE FOR THE FIRST TIME TO THE PRIMITIVE AND ASTONISHING SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHORUS. AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, WE MUST ADMIT THAT THE MEANING OF TRAGIC MYTH SET FORTH ABOVE NEVER BECAME CLEAR IN TRANSPARENT CONCEPTS TO THE GREEK POETS, NOT TO SPEAK OF THE GREEK PHILOSOPHERS: THEIR HEROES SPEAK, AS IT WERE, MORE SUPERFICIALLY THAN THEY ACT; THE MYTH DOES NOT AT ALL OBTAIN ADEQUATE OBJECTIFICATION IN THE SPOKEN WORD. THE STRUCTURE OF THE SCENES AND THE VISUAL IMAGES REVEAL A DEEPER WISDOM THAN THE POET HIMSELF CAN PUT INTO WORDS AND CONCEPTS: THE SAME IS ALSO OBSERVABLE IN SHAKESPEARE, WHOSE HAMLET, FOR INSTANCE, SIMILARLY, TALKS MORE SUPERFICIALLY THAN HE ACTS, SO THAT THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED LESSON OF HAMLET IS TO BE DEDUCED, NOT FROM HIS WORDS, BUT FROM A PROFOUND CONTEMPLATION AND SURVEY OF THE WHOLE.

WITH RESPECT TO GREEK TRAGEDY, WHICH OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF TO US ONLY AS WORD-DRAMA, I HAVE EVEN INTIMATED THAT THE LACK OF CONGRUITY BETWEEN MYTH AND EXPRESSION MIGHT EASILY LEAD US TO REGARD IT AS SHALLOWER AND LESS SIGNIFICANT THAN IT REALLY IS, AND ACCORDINGLY TO ATTRIBUTE TO IT A MORE SUPERFICIAL EFFECT THAN IT MUST HAVE HAD ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE ANCIENTS: FOR HOW EASILY ONE FORGETS THAT WHAT THE WORD-POET DID NOT SUCCEED IN DOING, NAMELY, ATTAIN THE HIGHEST SPIRITUALIZATION AND IDEALITY OF THE MYTH, HE MIGHT VERY WELL SUCCEED IN DOING EVERY MOMENT AS CREATIVE MUSICIAN! TO BE SURE, WE ARE ALMOST FORCED TO CONSTRUCT FOR OURSELVES BY SCHOLARLY RESEARCH THE SUPERIOR POWER OF THE MUSICAL EFFECT IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING OF THE INCOMPARABLE COMFORT WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN CHARACTERISTIC OF TRUE TRAGEDY. EVEN THIS MUSICAL SUPERIORITY, HOWEVER, WOULD ONLY HAVE BEEN FELT BY US HAD WE BEEN GREEKS; FOR IN THE ENTIRE DEVELOPMENT OF GREEK MUSIC‚ÄÎAS COMPARED WITH THE INFINITELY RICHER MUSIC KNOWN AND FAMILIAR TO US‚ÄÎWE IMAGINE WE HEAR ONLY THE YOUTHFUL SONG OF THE MUSICAL GENIUS MODESTLY INTONED. THE GREEKS, AS THE EGYPTIAN PRIESTS SAY, ARE ETERNAL CHILDREN, AND IN TRAGIC ART TOO THEY ARE ONLY CHILDREN WHO DO NOT KNOW WHAT A SUBLIME PLAYTHING ORIGINATED IN THEIR HANDS AND‚ÄÎWAS QUICKLY DEMOLISHED.

THAT STRIVING OF THE SPIRIT OF MUSIC TOWARD VISUAL AND MYTHICAL OBJECTIFICATION, WHICH INCREASES FROM THE BEGINNINGS OF LYRIC POETRY UP TO ATTIC TRAGEDY, SUDDENLY BREAKS OFF AFTER ATTAINING A LUXURIANT DEVELOPMENT, AND DISAPPEARS, AS IT WERE, FROM THE SURFACE OF HELLENIC ART; WHILE THE DIONYSIAN WORLD VIEW BORN OF THIS STRIVING LIVES ON IN THE MYSTERIES AND, IN ITS STRANGEST METAMORPHOSES AND DEBASEMENTS, DOES NOT CEASE TO ATTRACT SERIOUS NATURES. WILL IT NOT SOME DAY RISE ONCE AGAIN OUT OF ITS MYSTIC DEPTHS AS ART?

HERE WE ARE DETAINED BY THE QUESTION, WHETHER THE POWER, BY VIRTUE OF WHOSE OPPOSING INFLUENCE TRAGEDY PERISHED, HAS FOR ALL TIME SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO PREVENT THE ARTISTIC REAWAKENING OF TRAGEDY AND THE TRAGIC WORLD VIEW. IF ANCIENT TRAGEDY WAS DIVERTED FROM ITS COURSE BY THE DIALECTICAL DESIRE FOR KNOWLEDGE AND THE OPTIMISM OF SCIENCE, THIS FACT MIGHT LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN ETERNAL CONFLICT BETWEEN THE THEORETIC AND THE TRAGIC WORLD VIEW; AND ONLY AFTER THE SPIRIT OF SCIENCE HAS BEEN PURSUED TO ITS LIMITS, AND ITS CLAIM TO UNIVERSAL VALIDITY DESTROYED BY THE EVIDENCE OF THESE LIMITS MAY WE HOPE FOR A REBIRTH OF TRAGEDY‚ÄÎA FORM OF CULTURE FOR WHICH WE SHOULD HAVE TO USE THE SYMBOL OF THE MUSIC-PRACTICING SOCRATES IN THE SENSE SPOKEN OF ABOVE.1 IN THIS CONTRAST, I UNDERSTAND BY THE SPIRIT OF SCIENCE THE FAITH THAT FIRST CAME TO LIGHT IN THE PERSON OF SOCRATES‚ÄÎTHE FAITH IN THE EXPLICABILITY OF NATURE AND IN KNOWLEDGE AS A PANACEA.

HE WHO RECALLS THE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS RESTLESSLY PROGRESSING SPIRIT OF SCIENCE WILL REALIZE AT ONCE THAT MYTH WAS ANNIHILATED BY IT, AND THAT, BECAUSE OF THIS ANNIHILATION, POETRY WAS DRIVEN LIKE A HOMELESS BEING FROM HER NATURAL IDEAL SOIL. IF WE HAVE BEEN RIGHT IN ASSIGNING TO MUSIC THE POWER OF AGAIN GIVING BIRTH TO MYTH, WE MAY SIMILARLY EXPECT TO FIND THE SPIRIT OF SCIENCE ON THE PATH WHERE IT INIMICALLY OPPOSES THIS MYTHOPOEIC POWER OF MUSIC. THIS TAKES PLACE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW ATTIC DITHYRAMB, THE MUSIC OF WHICH NO LONGER EXPRESSED THE INNER ESSENCE, THE WILL ITSELF, BUT ONLY RENDERED THE PHENOMENON INADEQUATELY, IN AN IMITATION BY MEANS OF CONCEPTS. FROM THIS INTRINSICALLY DEGENERATE MUSIC THE GENUINELY MUSICAL NATURES TURNED AWAY WITH THE SAME REPUGNANCE THAT THEY FELT FOR THE ART-DESTROYING TENDENCY OF SOCRATES. THE UNERRING INSTINCT OF ARISTOPHANES WAS SURELY RIGHT WHEN IT INCLUDED SOCRATES HIMSELF, THE TRAGEDY OF EURIPIDES, AND THE MUSIC OF THE NEW DITHYRAMBIC POETS IN THE SAME FEELING OF HATRED, RECOGNIZING IN ALL THREE PHENOMENA THE SIGNS OF A DEGENERATE CULTURE.

IN THIS NEW DITHYRAMB, MUSIC IS OUTRAGEOUSLY MANIPULATED SO AS TO BE THE IMITATIVE COUNTERFEIT OF A PHENOMENON, FOR INSTANCE, OF A BATTLE OR A STORM AT SEA; AND THUS, OF COURSE, IT HAS BEEN UTTERLY ROBBED OF ITS MYTHOPOEIC POWER. FOR IF IT SEEKS TO AROUSE PLEASURE ONLY BY IMPELLING US TO SEEK EXTERNAL ANALOGIES BETWEEN A VITAL OR NATURAL PROCESS AND CERTAIN RHYTHMICAL FIGURES AND CHARACTERISTIC SOUNDS OF MUSIC; IF OUR UNDERSTANDING IS TO CONTENT ITSELF WITH THE PERCEPTION OF THESE ANALOGIES; WE ARE REDUCED TO A FRAME OF MIND WHICH MAKES IMPOSSIBLE ANY RECEPTION OF THE MYTHICAL; FOR THE MYTH WANTS TO BE EXPERIENCED VIVIDLY AS A UNIQUE EXAMPLE OF A UNIVERSALITY AND TRUTH THAT GAZE INTO THE INFINITE. THE TRULY DIONYSIAN MUSIC PRESENTS ITSELF AS SUCH A GENERAL MIRROR OF THE UNIVERSAL WILL: THE VIVID EVENT REFRACTED IN THIS MIRROR EXPANDS AT ONCE FOR OUR CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE COPY OF AN EXTERNAL TRUTH. CONVERSELY, SUCH A VIVID EVENT IS AT ONCE DIVESTED OF EVERY MYTHICAL CHARACTER BY THE TONE-PAINTING OF THE NEW DITHYRAMB; MUSIC NOW BECOMES A WRETCHED COPY OF THE PHENOMENON, AND THEREFORE INFINITELY POORER THAN THE PHENOMENON ITSELF. AND THROUGH THIS POVERTY IT STILL FURTHER REDUCES THE PHENOMENON FOR OUR CONSCIOUSNESS, SO THAT NOW, FOR EXAMPLE, A MUSICALLY IMITATED BATTLE OF THIS SORT EXHAUSTS ITSELF IN MARCHES, SIGNAL SOUNDS, ETC., AND OUR IMAGINATION IS ARRESTED PRECISELY BY THESE SUPERFICIALITIES. TONE-PAINTING IS THUS IN EVERY RESPECT THE OPPOSITE OF TRUE MUSIC WITH ITS MYTHOPOEIC POWER: THROUGH IT THE PHENOMENON, POOR IN ITSELF, IS MADE STILL POORER, WHILE THROUGH DIONYSIAN MUSIC THE INDIVIDUAL PHENOMENON IS ENRICHED AND EXPANDED INTO AN IMAGE OF THE WORLD. IT WAS A GREAT TRIUMPH FOR THE UN-DIONYSIAN SPIRIT WHEN, BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW DITHYRAMB, IT HAD ESTRANGED MUSIC FROM ITSELF AND REDUCED IT TO BE THE SLAVE OF PHENOMENA. EURIPIDES, WHO, THOUGH IN A HIGHER SENSE, MUST BE CONSIDERED A THOROUGHLY UNMUSICAL NATURE, IS FOR THIS VERY REASON A PASSIONATE ADHERENT OF THE NEW DITHYRAMBIC MUSIC, AND WITH THE LIBERALITY OF A ROBBER MAKES USE OF ALL ITS EFFECTIVE TRICKS AND MANNERISMS.

IN ANOTHER DIRECTION ALSO WE SEE AT WORK THE POWER OF THIS UN-DIONYSIAN MYTH-OPPOSING SPIRIT, WHEN WE TURN OUR ATTENTION TO THE PREVALENCE OF CHARACTER REPRESENTATION AND PSYCHOLOGICAL REFINEMENT IN TRAGEDY FROM SOPHOCLES ONWARD. THE CHARACTER MUST NO LONGER BE EXPANDED INTO AN ETERNAL TYPE, BUT, ON THE CONTRARY, MUST DEVELOP INDIVIDUALLY THROUGH ARTISTIC SUBORDINATE TRAITS AND SHADINGS, THROUGH THE NICEST PRECISION OF ALL LINES, IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE SPECTATOR IS IN GENERAL NO LONGER CONSCIOUS OF THE MYTH, BUT OF THE VIGOROUS TRUTH TO NATURE AND THE ARTIST‚ÄÔS IMITATIVE POWER. HERE ALSO WE OBSERVE THE VICTORY OF THE PHENOMENON OVER THE UNIVERSAL, AND THE DELIGHT IN A UNIQUE, ALMOST ANATOMICAL PREPARATION; WE ARE ALREADY IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF A THEORETICAL WORLD, WHERE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE IS VALUED MORE HIGHLY THAN THE ARTISTIC REFLECTION OF A UNIVERSAL LAW.

THE MOVEMENT IN THE DIRECTION OF CHARACTER DELINEATION PROCEEDS RAPIDLY: WHILE SOPHOCLES STILL PORTRAYS COMPLETE CHARACTERS AND EMPLOYS MYTH FOR THEIR REFINED DEVELOPMENT, EURIPIDES ALREADY DRAWS ONLY PROMINENT INDIVIDUAL TRAITS OF CHARACTER, WHICH CAN EXPRESS THEMSELVES IN VIOLENT BURSTS OF PASSION. IN THE NEW ATTIC COMEDY, HOWEVER, THERE ARE ONLY MASKS WITH ONE EXPRESSION: FRIVOLOUS OLD MEN, DUPED PANDERS, AND CUNNING SLAVES, RECURRING INCESSANTLY. WHERE NOW IS THE MYTHOPOEIC SPIRIT OF MUSIC? WHAT STILL REMAINS OF MUSIC IS EITHER EXCITATORY OR REMINISCENT MUSIC, THAT IS, EITHER A STIMULANT FOR DULL AND FADED NERVES, OR TONE-PAINTING. AS REGARDS THE FORMER, IT HARDLY MATTERS ABOUT THE TEXT SET TO IT: AS SOON AS HIS HEROES AND CHORUSES BEGIN TO SING, EVERYTHING BECOMES PRETTY SLOVENLY IN EURIPIDES; TO WHAT PASS MUST THINGS HAVE COME WITH HIS IMPERTINENT SUCCESSORS?

THE NEW UN-DIONYSIAN SPIRIT, HOWEVER, REVEALS ITSELF MOST PLAINLY IN THE D√©NOUEMENTS OF THE NEW DRAMAS. IN THE OLD TRAGEDY ONE COULD SENSE AT THE END THAT METAPHYSICAL COMFORT WITHOUT WHICH THE DELIGHT IN TRAGEDY CANNOT BE EXPLAINED AT ALL. THE RECONCILING TONES FROM ANOTHER WORLD SOUND PUREST, PERHAPS, IN THE OEDIPUS AT COLONUS. NOW THAT THE GENIUS OF MUSIC HAS FLED FROM TRAGEDY, TRAGEDY, STRICTLY SPEAKING, IS DEAD: FOR FROM WHAT SOURCE SHALL WE NOW DRAW THIS METAPHYSICAL COMFORT? THE NEW SPIRIT, THEREFORE, SOUGHT FOR AN EARTHLY RESOLUTION OF THE TRAGIC DISSONANCE. THE HERO, AFTER BEING SUFFICIENTLY TORTURED BY FATE, EARNED A WELL-DESERVED REWARD THROUGH A SPLENDID MARRIAGE OR TOKENS OF DIVINE FAVOR. THE HERO HAD TURNED GLADIATOR ON WHOM, AFTER HE HAD BEEN NICELY BEATEN AND COVERED WITH WOUNDS, FREEDOM WAS OCCASIONALLY BESTOWED. THE DEUS EX MACHINA TOOK THE PLACE OF METAPHYSICAL COMFORT.

I WILL NOT SAY THAT THE TRAGIC WORLD VIEW WAS EVERYWHERE COMPLETELY DESTROYED BY THIS INTRUDING UN-DIONYSIAN SPIRIT: WE ONLY KNOW THAT IT HAD TO FLEE FROM ART INTO THE UNDERWORLD AS IT WERE, IN THE DEGENERATE FORM OF A SECRET CULT. OVER THE WIDEST EXTENT OF THE HELLENIC CHARACTER, HOWEVER, THERE RAGED THE CONSUMING BLAST OF THIS SPIRIT, WHICH MANIFESTS ITSELF IN THE FORM OF ‚ÄÚGREEK CHEERFULNESS,‚ÄÙ WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OF AS A SENILE, UNPRODUCTIVE LOVE OF EXISTENCE. THIS CHEERFULNESS STANDS OPPOSED TO THE SPLENDID ‚ÄÚNA√ØVET√©‚ÄÙ OF THE EARLIER GREEKS, WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE CHARACTERIZATION GIVEN ABOVE, MUST BE CONCEIVED AS THE BLOSSOM OF THE APOLLINIAN CULTURE SPRINGING FROM A DARK ABYSS, AS THE VICTORY WHICH THE HELLENIC WILL, THROUGH ITS MIRRORING OF BEAUTY, OBTAINS OVER SUFFERING AND THE WISDOM OF SUFFERING.

THE NOBLEST MANIFESTATION OF THAT OTHER FORM OF ‚ÄÚGREEK CHEERFULNESS,‚ÄÙ THE ALEXANDRIAN, IS THE CHEERFULNESS OF THE THEORETICAL MAN. IT EXHIBITS THE SAME CHARACTERISTIC SYMPTOMS THAT I HAVE JUST DEDUCED FROM THE SPIRIT OF THE UN-DIONYSIAN: IT COMBATS DIONYSIAN WISDOM AND ART, IT SEEKS TO DISSOLVE MYTH, IT SUBSTITUTES FOR A METAPHYSICAL COMFORT AN EARTHLY CONSONANCE, IN FACT, A DEUS EX MACHINA OF ITS OWN, THE GOD OF MACHINES AND CRUCIBLES, THAT IS, THE POWERS OF THE SPIRITS OF NATURE RECOGNIZED AND EMPLOYED IN THE SERVICE OF A HIGHER EGOISM; IT BELIEVES THAT IT CAN CORRECT THE WORLD BY KNOWLEDGE, GUIDE LIFE BY SCIENCE, AND ACTUALLY CONFINE THE INDIVIDUAL WITHIN A LIMITED SPHERE OF SOLVABLE PROBLEMS, FROM WHICH HE CAN CHEERFULLY SAY TO LIFE: ‚ÄÚI DESIRE YOU; YOU ARE WORTH KNOWING.‚ÄÙ

IT IS AN ETERNAL PHENOMENON: THE INSATIABLE WILL ALWAYS FINDS A WAY TO DETAIN ITS CREATURES IN LIFE AND COMPEL THEM TO LIVE ON, BY MEANS OF AN ILLUSION SPREAD OVER THINGS. ONE IS CHAINED BY THE SOCRATIC LOVE OF KNOWLEDGE AND THE DELUSION OF BEING ABLE THEREBY TO HEAL THE ETERNAL WOUND OF EXISTENCE; ANOTHER IS ENSNARED BY ART‚ÄÔS SEDUCTIVE VEIL OF BEAUTY FLUTTERING BEFORE HIS EYES; STILL ANOTHER BY THE METAPHYSICAL COMFORT THAT BENEATH THE WHIRL OF PHENOMENA ETERNAL LIFE FLOWS ON INDESTRUCTIBLY‚ÄÎTO SAY NOTHING OF THE MORE VULGAR AND ALMOST MORE POWERFUL ILLUSIONS WHICH THE WILL ALWAYS HAS AT HAND. THESE THREE STAGES OF ILLUSION ARE ACTUALLY DESIGNED ONLY FOR THE MORE NOBLY FORMED NATURES, WHO ACTUALLY FEEL PROFOUNDLY THE WEIGHT AND BURDEN OF EXISTENCE, AND MUST BE DELUDED BY EXQUISITE STIMULANTS INTO FORGETFULNESS OF THEIR DISPLEASURE. ALL THAT WE CALL CULTURE IS MADE UP OF THESE STIMULANTS; AND, ACCORDING TO THE PROPORTION OF THE INGREDIENTS, WE HAVE EITHER A DOMINANTLY SOCRATIC OR ARTISTIC OR TRAGIC CULTURE; OR, IF HISTORICAL EXEMPLIFICATIONS ARE PERMITTED, THERE IS EITHER AN ALEXANDRIAN OR A HELLENIC OR A BUDDHISTIC CULTURE.1

OUR WHOLE MODERN WORLD IS ENTANGLED IN THE NET OF ALEXANDRIAN2 CULTURE. IT PROPOSES AS ITS IDEAL THE THEORETICAL MAN EQUIPPED WITH THE GREATEST FORCES OF KNOWLEDGE, AND LABORING IN THE SERVICE OF SCIENCE, WHOSE ARCHETYPE AND PROGENITOR IS SOCRATES. ALL OUR EDUCATIONAL METHODS ORIGINALLY HAVE THIS IDEAL IN VIEW: EVERY OTHER FORM OF EXISTENCE MUST STRUGGLE ON LABORIOUSLY BESIDE IT, AS SOMETHING TOLERATED, BUT NOT INTENDED. IN AN ALMOST ALARMING MANNER THE CULTURED MAN WAS FOR A LONG TIME FOUND ONLY IN THE FORM OF THE SCHOLAR: EVEN OUR POETICAL ARTS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO EVOLVE FROM SCHOLARLY IMITATIONS, AND IN THE MAIN EFFECT, THAT OF RHYME, WE STILL RECOGNIZE THE ORIGIN OF OUR POETIC FORM FROM ARTIFICIAL EXPERIMENTS WITH A NONINDIGENOUS, REALLY SCHOLARLY LANGUAGE. HOW UNINTELLIGIBLE MUST FAUST, THE MODERN CULTURED MAN, WHO IS IN HIMSELF INTELLIGIBLE, HAVE APPEARED TO A TRUE GREEK‚ÄÎFAUST, STORMING UNSATISFIED THROUGH ALL THE FACULTIES, DEVOTED TO MAGIC AND THE DEVIL FROM A DESIRE FOR KNOWLEDGE; FAUST, WHOM WE HAVE BUT TO PLACE BESIDE SOCRATES FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPARISON, IN ORDER TO SEE THAT MODERN MAN IS BEGINNING TO DIVINE THE LIMITS OF THIS SOCRATIC LOVE OF KNOWLEDGE AND YEARNS FOR A COAST IN THE WIDE WASTE OF THE OCEAN OF KNOWLEDGE. WHEN GOETHE ON ONE OCCASION SAID TO ECKERMANN WITH REFERENCE TO NAPOLEON: ‚ÄÚYES, MY GOOD FRIEND, THERE IS ALSO A PRODUCTIVENESS OF DEEDS,‚ÄÙ HE REMINDED US IN A CHARMINGLY NA√ØVE MANNER THAT THE NONTHEORIST IS SOMETHING INCREDIBLE AND ASTOUNDING TO MODERN MAN; SO THAT WE AGAIN HAVE NEED OF THE WISDOM OF GOETHE TO DISCOVER THAT SUCH A SURPRISING FORM OF EXISTENCE IS NOT ONLY COMPREHENSIBLE, BUT EVEN PARDONABLE.

NOW WE MUST NOT HIDE FROM OURSELVES WHAT IS CONCEALED IN THE WOMB OF THIS SOCRATIC CULTURE: OPTIMISM, WITH ITS DELUSION OF LIMITLESS POWER. WE MUST NOT BE ALARMED IF THE FRUITS OF THIS OPTIMISM RIPEN‚ÄÎIF SOCIETY, LEAVENED TO THE VERY LOWEST STRATA BY THIS KIND OF CULTURE, GRADUALLY BEGINS TO TREMBLE WITH WANTON AGITATIONS AND DESIRES, IF THE BELIEF IN THE EARTHLY HAPPINESS OF ALL, IF THE BELIEF IN THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH A GENERAL INTELLECTUAL CULTURE CHANGES INTO THE THREATENING DEMAND FOR SUCH AN ALEXANDRIAN EARTHLY HAPPINESS, INTO THE CONJURING UP OF A EURIPIDEAN DEUS EX MACHINA.

LET US MARK THIS WELL: THE ALEXANDRIAN CULTURE, TO BE ABLE TO EXIST PERMANENTLY, REQUIRES A SLAVE CLASS, BUT WITH ITS OPTIMISTIC VIEW OF LIFE IT DENIES THE NECESSITY OF SUCH A CLASS, AND CONSEQUENTLY, WHEN ITS BEAUTIFULLY SEDUCTIVE AND TRANQUILLIZING UTTERANCES ABOUT THE ‚ÄÚDIGNITY OF MAN‚ÄÙ AND THE ‚ÄÚDIGNITY OF LABOR‚ÄÙ ARE NO LONGER EFFECTIVE, IT GRADUALLY DRIFTS TOWARD A DREADFUL DESTRUCTION. THERE IS NOTHING MORE TERRIBLE THAN A CLASS OF BARBARIC SLAVES WHO HAVE LEARNED TO REGARD THEIR EXISTENCE AS AN INJUSTICE, AND NOW PREPARE TO AVENGE, NOT ONLY THEMSELVES, BUT ALL GENERATIONS. IN THE FACE OF SUCH THREATENING STORMS, WHO DARES TO APPEAL WITH ANY CONFIDENCE TO OUR PALE AND EXHAUSTED RELIGIONS, THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF WHICH HAVE DEGENERATED INTO SCHOLARLY RELIGIONS? MYTH, THE NECESSARY PREREQUISITE OF EVERY RELIGION, IS ALREADY PARALYZED EVERYWHERE, AND EVEN IN THIS DOMAIN THE OPTIMISTIC SPIRIT, WHICH WE HAVE JUST DESIGNATED AS THE GERM OF DESTRUCTION IN OUR SOCIETY, HAS ATTAINED THE MASTERY.

WHILE THE DISASTER SLUMBERING IN THE WOMB OF THEORETICAL CULTURE GRADUALLY BEGINS TO FRIGHTEN MODERN MAN, AND HE ANXIOUSLY RANSACKS THE STORES OF HIS EXPERIENCE FOR MEANS TO AVERT THE DANGER, THOUGH HE HAS NO GREAT FAITH IN THESE MEANS; WHILE HE, THEREFORE, BEGINS TO DIVINE THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS SITUATION‚ÄÎGREAT MEN, UNIVERSALLY GIFTED, HAVE CONTRIVED, WITH AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF THOUGHT, TO MAKE USE OF THE PARAPHERNALIA OF SCIENCE ITSELF, TO POINT OUT THE LIMITS AND THE RELATIVITY OF KNOWLEDGE GENERALLY, AND THUS TO DENY DECISIVELY THE CLAIM OF SCIENCE TO UNIVERSAL VALIDITY AND UNIVERSAL AIMS. AND THEIR DEMONSTRATION DIAGNOSED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE ILLUSORY NOTION WHICH PRETENDS TO BE ABLE TO FATHOM THE INNERMOST ESSENCE OF THINGS WITH THE AID OF CAUSALITY. THE EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE AND WISDOM OF KANT AND SCHOPENHAUER HAVE SUCCEEDED IN GAINING THE MOST DIFFICULT VICTORY, THE VICTORY OVER THE OPTIMISM CONCEALED IN THE ESSENCE OF LOGIC‚ÄÎAN OPTIMISM THAT IS THE BASIS OF OUR CULTURE. WHILE THIS OPTIMISM, RESTING ON APPARENTLY UNOBJECTIONABLE AETERNAE VERITATES,3 HAD BELIEVED THAT ALL THE RIDDLES OF THE UNIVERSE COULD BE KNOWN AND FATHOMED, AND HAD TREATED SPACE, TIME, AND CAUSALITY AS ENTIRELY UNCONDITIONAL LAWS OF THE MOST UNIVERSAL VALIDITY, KANT SHOWED THAT THESE REALLY SERVED ONLY TO ELEVATE THE MERE PHENOMENON, THE WORK OF MƑÅYƑÅ, TO THE POSITION OF THE SOLE AND HIGHEST REALITY, AS IF IT WERE THE INNERMOST AND TRUE ESSENCE OF THINGS, THUS MAKING IMPOSSIBLE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THIS ESSENCE OR, IN SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS WORDS, LULLING THE DREAMER STILL MORE SOUNDLY ASLEEP.

WITH THIS INSIGHT A CULTURE IS INAUGURATED THAT I VENTURE TO CALL A TRAGIC CULTURE. ITS MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC IS THAT WISDOM TAKES THE PLACE OF SCIENCE AS THE HIGHEST END‚ÄÎWISDOM THAT, UNINFLUENCED BY THE SEDUCTIVE DISTRACTIONS OF THE SCIENCES, TURNS WITH UNMOVED EYES TO A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF THE WORLD, AND SEEKS TO GRASP, WITH SYMPATHETIC FEELINGS OF LOVE, THE ETERNAL SUFFERING AS ITS OWN.

LET US IMAGINE A COMING GENERATION WITH SUCH INTREPIDITY OF VISION, WITH SUCH A HEROIC PENCHANT FOR THE TREMENDOUS; LET US IMAGINE THE BOLD STRIDE OF THESE DRAGON-SLAYERS, THE PROUD AUDACITY WITH WHICH THEY TURN THEIR BACK ON ALL THE WEAKLINGS‚ÄÔ DOCTRINES OF OPTIMISM IN ORDER TO ‚ÄÚLIVE RESOLUTELY‚ÄÙ IN WHOLENESS AND FULLNESS:4 WOULD IT NOT BE NECESSARY FOR THE TRAGIC MAN OF SUCH A CULTURE, IN VIEW OF HIS SELF-EDUCATION FOR SERIOUSNESS AND TERROR, TO DESIRE A NEW ART, THE ART OF METAPHYSICAL COMFORT, TO DESIRE TRAGEDY AS HIS OWN PROPER HELEN, AND TO EXCLAIM WITH FAUST:

SHOULD NOT MY LONGING OVERLEAP THE DISTANCE

AND DRAW THE FAIREST FORM INTO EXISTENCE?5



BUT NOW THAT THE SOCRATIC CULTURE CAN ONLY HOLD THE SCEPTER OF ITS INFALLIBILITY WITH TREMBLING HANDS; NOW THAT IT HAS BEEN SHAKEN FROM TWO DIRECTIONS‚ÄÎONCE BY THE FEAR OF ITS OWN CONSEQUENCES WHICH IT AT LENGTH BEGINS TO SURMISE, AND AGAIN BECAUSE IT NO LONGER HAS ITS FORMER NA√ØVE CONFIDENCE IN THE ETERNAL VALIDITY OF ITS FOUNDATION‚ÄÎIT IS A SAD SPECTACLE TO SEE HOW THE DANCE OF ITS THOUGHT RUSHES LONGINGLY TOWARD EVER-NEW FORMS, TO EMBRACE THEM, AND THEN, SHUDDERING, LETS THEM GO SUDDENLY AS MEPHISTOPHELES DOES THE SEDUCTIVE LAMIAE.6 IT IS CERTAINLY THE SIGN OF THE ‚ÄÚBREACH‚ÄÙ OF WHICH EVERYONE SPEAKS AS THE FUNDAMENTAL MALADY OF MODERN CULTURE, THAT THE THEORETICAL MAN, ALARMED AND DISSATISFIED AT HIS OWN CONSEQUENCES, NO LONGER DARES ENTRUST HIMSELF TO THE TERRIBLE ICY CURRENT OF EXISTENCE: HE RUNS TIMIDLY UP AND DOWN THE BANK. SO THOROUGHLY HAS HE BEEN PAMPERED BY HIS OPTIMISTIC VIEWS THAT HE NO LONGER WANTS TO HAVE ANYTHING WHOLE, WITH ALL OF NATURE‚ÄÔS CRUELTY ATTACHING TO IT. BESIDES, HE FEELS THAT A CULTURE BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE MUST BE DESTROYED WHEN IT BEGINS TO GROW ILLOGICAL, THAT IS, TO RETREAT BEFORE ITS OWN CONSEQUENCES. OUR ART REVEALS THIS UNIVERSAL DISTRESS: IN VAIN DOES ONE DEPEND IMITATIVELY ON ALL THE GREAT PRODUCTIVE PERIODS AND NATURES; IN VAIN DOES ONE ACCUMULATE THE ENTIRE ‚ÄÚWORLD-LITERATURE‚ÄÙ AROUND MODERN MAN FOR HIS COMFORT; IN VAIN DOES ONE PLACE ONESELF IN THE MIDST OF THE ART STYLES AND ARTISTS OF ALL AGES, SO THAT ONE MAY GIVE NAMES TO THEM AS ADAM DID TO THE BEASTS: ONE STILL REMAINS ETERNALLY HUNGRY, THE ‚ÄÚCRITIC‚ÄÙ WITHOUT JOY AND ENERGY, THE ALEXANDRIAN MAN, WHO IS AT BOTTOM A LIBRARIAN AND CORRECTOR OF PROOFS, AND WRETCHEDLY GOES BLIND FROM THE DUST OF BOOKS AND FROM PRINTERS‚ÄÔ ERRORS.

WE CANNOT INDICATE THE INNERMOST MODERN CONTENT OF THIS SOCRATIC CULTURE MORE DISTINCTLY THAN BY CALLING IT THE CULTURE OF THE OPERA: FOR IT IS IN THIS DEPARTMENT THAT THIS CULTURE HAS EXPRESSED ITS AIMS AND PERCEPTIONS WITH SPECIAL NA√ØVET√©, WHICH IS SURPRISING WHEN WE COMPARE THE GENESIS OF THE OPERA AND THE FACTS OF OPERATIC DEVELOPMENT WITH THE ETERNAL TRUTHS OF THE APOLLINIAN AND DIONYSIAN. I RECALL FIRST OF ALL THE ORIGIN OF THE STILO RAPPRESENTATIVO1 AND THE RECITATIVE. IS IT CREDIBLE THAT THIS THOROUGHLY EXTERNALIZED OPERATIC MUSIC, INCAPABLE OF DEVOTION, COULD BE RECEIVED AND CHERISHED WITH ENTHUSIASTIC FAVOR, AS A REBIRTH, AS IT WERE, OF ALL TRUE MUSIC, BY THE VERY AGE IN WHICH HAD APPEARED THE INEFFABLY SUBLIME AND SACRED MUSIC OF PALESTRINA? AND WHO, ON THE OTHER HAND, WOULD THINK OF MAKING ONLY THE DIVERSION-CRAVING LUXURIOUSNESS OF THOSE FLORENTINE CIRCLES AND THE VANITY OF THEIR DRAMATIC SINGERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOVE OF THE OPERA WHICH SPREAD WITH SUCH RAPIDITY? THAT IN THE SAME AGE, EVEN AMONG THE SAME PEOPLE, THIS PASSION FOR A HALF-MUSICAL MODE OF SPEECH SHOULD AWAKEN ALONGSIDE OF THE VAULTED STRUCTURE OF PALESTRINA HARMONIES WHICH ALL MEDIEVAL CHRISTENDOM HAD BEEN BUILDING UP, I CAN EXPLAIN TO MYSELF ONLY BY A COOPERATING, EXTRA-ARTISTIC TENDENCY IN THE ESSENCE OF THE RECITATIVE.

THE LISTENER WHO INSISTS ON DISTINCTLY HEARING THE WORDS UNDER THE MUSIC HAS HIS DESIRE FULFILLED BY THE SINGER IN THAT THE LATTER SPEAKS RATHER THAN SINGS, INTENSIFYING THE PATHETIC EXPRESSION OF THE WORDS BY MEANS OF THIS HALF-SONG. BY THIS INTENSIFICATION OF THE PATHOS HE FACILITATES THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORDS AND OVERCOMES THE REMAINING HALF OF THE MUSIC. THE SPECIFIC DANGER NOW THREATENING HIM IS THAT IN SOME UNGUARDED MOMENT HE MAY STRESS THE MUSIC UNDULY, WHICH WOULD IMMEDIATELY ENTAIL THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PATHOS OF THE SPEECH AND THE DISTINCTNESS OF THE WORDS; WHILE, ON THE OTHER HAND, HE FEELS HIMSELF CONTINUALLY IMPELLED TO MUSICAL DISCHARGE AND A VIRTUOSO EXHIBITION OF HIS VOCAL TALENT. HERE THE ‚ÄÚPOET‚ÄÙ COMES TO HIS AID, WHO KNOWS HOW TO PROVIDE HIM WITH ABUNDANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR LYRICAL INTERJECTIONS, REPETITIONS OF WORDS AND SENTENCES, ETC.‚ÄÎAT WHICH PLACES THE SINGER, NOW IN THE PURELY MUSICAL ELEMENT, CAN REST HIMSELF WITHOUT PAYING ANY ATTENTION TO THE WORDS. THIS ALTERNATION OF EMOTIONALLY IMPRESSIVE SPEECH WHICH, HOWEVER, IS ONLY HALF SUNG, WITH INTERJECTIONS WHICH ARE WHOLLY SUNG, AN ALTERNATION CHARACTERISTIC OF THE STILO RAPPRESENTATIVO, THIS RAPIDLY CHANGING ENDEAVOR TO AFFECT NOW THE CONCEPTS AND IMAGINATION OF THE HEARER, NOW HIS MUSICAL SENSE, IS SOMETHING SO UTTERLY UNNATURAL AND LIKEWISE SO INTRINSICALLY CONTRADICTORY BOTH TO THE APOLLINIAN AND DIONYSIAN ARTISTIC IMPULSES, THAT ONE HAS TO INFER AN ORIGIN OF THE RECITATIVE LYING OUTSIDE ALL ARTISTIC INSTINCTS. ACCORDING TO THIS DESCRIPTION, THE RECITATIVE MUST BE DEFINED AS A MIXTURE OF EPIC AND LYRIC DELIVERY, NOT BY ANY MEANS AS AN INTRINSICALLY STABLE MIXTURE, A STATE NOT TO BE ATTAINED IN THE CASE OF SUCH TOTALLY DISPARATE ELEMENTS, BUT AS AN ENTIRELY SUPERFICIAL MOSAIC CONGLUTINATION, SUCH AS IS TOTALLY UNPRECEDENTED IN THE DOMAIN OF NATURE AND EXPERIENCE. BUT THIS WAS NOT THE OPINION OF THE INVENTORS OF THE RECITATIVE: THEY THEMSELVES, TOGETHER WITH THEIR AGE, BELIEVED RATHER THAT THE MYSTERY OF ANTIQUE MUSIC HAS BEEN SOLVED BY THIS STILO RAPPRESENTATIVO, IN WHICH, SO THEY THOUGHT, WAS TO BE FOUND THE ONLY EXPLANATION OF THE ENORMOUS INFLUENCE OF AN ORPHEUS, AN AMPHION, AND EVEN OF GREEK TRAGEDY. THE NEW STYLE WAS LOOKED UPON AS THE REAWAKENING OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE MUSIC, ANCIENT GREEK MUSIC: INDEED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UNIVERSAL AND POPULAR CONCEPTION OF THE HOMERIC AS THE PRIMITIVE WORLD, THEY COULD ABANDON THEMSELVES TO THE DREAM OF HAVING DESCENDED ONCE MORE INTO THE PARADISIACAL BEGINNINGS OF MANKIND, WHERE MUSIC ALSO MUST HAVE HAD THAT UNSURPASSED PURITY, POWER, AND INNOCENCE OF WHICH THE POETS, IN THEIR PASTORAL PLAYS, COULD GIVE SUCH TOUCHING ACCOUNTS. HERE WE CAN SEE INTO THE INNERMOST DEVELOPMENT OF THIS THOROUGHLY MODERN VARIETY OF ART, THE OPERA: ART HERE RESPONDS TO A POWERFUL NEED, BUT IT IS A NONAESTHETIC NEED: THE YEARNING FOR THE IDYLLIC, THE FAITH IN THE PRIMORDIAL EXISTENCE OF THE ARTISTIC AND GOOD MAN. THE RECITATIVE WAS REGARDED AS THE REDISCOVERED LANGUAGE OF THIS PRIMITIVE MAN; OPERA AS THE REDISCOVERED COUNTRY OF THIS IDYLLICALLY OR HEROICALLY GOOD CREATURE, WHO SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH EVERY ACTION FOLLOWS A NATURAL ARTISTIC IMPULSE, WHO ACCOMPLISHES HIS SPEECH WITH A LITTLE SINGING, IN ORDER THAT HE MAY IMMEDIATELY BREAK FORTH INTO FULL SONG AT THE SLIGHTEST EMOTIONAL EXCITEMENT.

IT IS NOW A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO US THAT THE HUMANISTS OF THE TIME COMBATED THE OLD ECCLESIASTICAL CONCEPTION OF MAN AS INHERENTLY CORRUPT AND LOST, WITH THIS NEWLY CREATED PICTURE OF THE PARADISIACAL ARTIST: SO THAT OPERA IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS THE OPPOSITION DOGMA OF THE GOOD MAN, BUT MAY ALSO, AT THE SAME TIME, PROVIDE A CONSOLATION FOR THAT PESSIMISM WHICH, OWING TO THE FRIGHTFUL UNCERTAINTY OF ALL CONDITIONS OF LIFE, ATTRACTED PRECISELY THE SERIOUS-MINDED MEN OF THE TIME. FOR US, IT IS ENOUGH TO HAVE PERCEIVED THAT THE ESSENTIAL CHARM, AND THEREFORE THE GENESIS, OF THIS NEW ART FORM LIES IN THE GRATIFICATION OF AN ALTOGETHER NONAESTHETIC NEED, IN THE OPTIMISTIC GLORIFICATION OF MAN AS SUCH, IN THE CONCEPTION OF THE PRIMITIVE MAN AS THE MAN NATURALLY GOOD AND ARTISTIC‚ÄÎA PRINCIPLE OF THE OPERA THAT HAS GRADUALLY CHANGED INTO A THREATENING AND TERRIBLE DEMAND WHICH, IN FACE OF CONTEMPORARY SOCIALISTIC MOVEMENTS, WE CAN NO LONGER IGNORE. THE ‚ÄÚGOOD PRIMITIVE MAN‚ÄÙ WANTS HIS RIGHTS: WHAT PARADISIACAL PROSPECTS!

BESIDES THIS I PLACE ANOTHER EQUALLY OBVIOUS CONFIRMATION OF MY VIEW THAT OPERA IS BASED ON THE SAME PRINCIPLES AS OUR ALEXANDRIAN CULTURE. OPERA IS THE BIRTH OF THE THEORETICAL MAN, THE CRITICAL LAYMAN, NOT OF THE ARTIST: ONE OF THE MOST SURPRISING FACTS IN THE HISTORY OF ALL THE ARTS. IT WAS THE DEMAND OF THOROUGHLY UNMUSICAL HEARERS THAT BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE THE WORDS MUST BE UNDERSTOOD, SO THAT ACCORDING TO THEM A REBIRTH OF MUSIC IS TO BE EXPECTED ONLY WHEN SOME MODE OF SINGING HAS BEEN DISCOVERED IN WHICH TEXT-WORD LORDS IT OVER COUNTERPOINT LIKE MASTER OVER SERVANT. FOR THE WORDS, IT IS ARGUED, ARE AS MUCH NOBLER THAN THE ACCOMPANYING HARMONIC SYSTEM AS THE SOUL IS NOBLER THAN THE BODY.

IT WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAICALLY UNMUSICAL CRUDENESS OF THESE VIEWS THAT THE COMBINATION OF MUSIC, IMAGE, AND WORDS WAS EFFECTED IN THE BEGINNINGS OF THE OPERA. IN THE SPIRIT OF THIS AESTHETIC THE FIRST EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE IN THE LEADING AMATEUR CIRCLES OF FLORENCE BY THE POETS AND SINGERS PATRONIZED THERE. THE MAN INCAPABLE OF ART CREATES FOR HIMSELF A KIND OF ART PRECISELY BECAUSE HE IS THE INARTISTIC MAN AS SUCH. BECAUSE HE DOES NOT SENSE THE DIONYSIAN DEPTH OF MUSIC, HE CHANGES HIS MUSICAL TASTE INTO AN APPRECIATION OF THE UNDERSTANDABLE WORD-AND-TONE-RHETORIC OF THE PASSIONS IN THE STILO RAPPRESENTATIVO, AND INTO THE VOLUPTUOUSNESS OF THE ARTS OF SONG. BECAUSE HE IS UNABLE TO BEHOLD A VISION, HE FORCES THE MACHINIST AND THE DECORATIVE ARTIST INTO HIS SERVICE. BECAUSE HE CANNOT COMPREHEND THE TRUE NATURE OF THE ARTIST, HE CONJURES UP THE ‚ÄÚARTISTIC PRIMITIVE MAN‚ÄÙ TO SUIT HIS TASTE, THAT IS, THE MAN WHO SINGS AND RECITES VERSES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PASSION. HE DREAMS HIMSELF BACK INTO A TIME WHEN PASSION SUFFICED TO GENERATE SONGS AND POEMS; AS IF EMOTION HAD EVER BEEN ABLE TO CREATE ANYTHING ARTISTIC.

THE PREMISE OF THE OPERA IS A FALSE BELIEF CONCERNING THE ARTISTIC PROCESS: THE IDYLLIC BELIEF THAT EVERY SENTIENT MAN IS AN ARTIST. THIS BELIEF WOULD MAKE OPERA THE EXPRESSION OF THE TASTE OF THE LAITY IN ART, DICTATING THEIR LAWS WITH THE CHEERFUL OPTIMISM OF THE THEORETICAL MAN.

SHOULD WE DESIRE TO COMBINE THE TWO CONCEPTIONS THAT HAVE JUST BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE INFLUENCED THE ORIGIN OF OPERA, IT WOULD MERELY REMAIN FOR US TO SPEAK OF AN IDYLLIC TENDENCY OF THE OPERA. IN THIS CONNECTION WE NEED ONLY AVAIL OURSELVES OF THE EXPRESSIONS AND EXPLANATION OF SCHILLER. NATURE AND THE IDEAL, HE SAYS, ARE EITHER OBJECTS OF GRIEF, WHEN THE FORMER IS REPRESENTED AS LOST, THE LATTER UNATTAINED; OR BOTH ARE OBJECTS OF JOY, IN THAT THEY ARE REPRESENTED AS REAL. THE FIRST CASE FURNISHES THE ELEGY IN ITS NARROWER SIGNIFICATION, THE SECOND THE IDYLL IN ITS WIDEST SENSE.

HERE WE MUST AT ONCE CALL ATTENTION TO THE COMMON CHARACTERISTIC OF THESE TWO CONCEPTIONS IN THE GENESIS OF OPERA, NAMELY, THAT IN THEM THE IDEAL IS NOT FELT AS UNATTAINED OR NATURE AS LOST. THIS SENTIMENT SUPPOSES THAT THERE WAS A PRIMITIVE AGE OF MAN WHEN HE LAY CLOSE TO THE HEART OF NATURE, AND, OWING TO THIS NATURALNESS, HAD AT ONCE ATTAINED THE IDEAL OF MANKIND IN A PARADISIACAL GOODNESS AND ARTISTRY. FROM THIS PERFECT PRIMITIVE MAN ALL OF US WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DESCENDED. WE WERE EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE FAITHFUL COPIES OF HIM; ONLY WE HAD TO CAST OFF A FEW THINGS IN ORDER TO RECOGNIZE OURSELVES ONCE MORE AS THIS PRIMITIVE MAN, ON THE STRENGTH OF A VOLUNTARY RENUNCIATION OF SUPERFLUOUS LEARNEDNESS, OF SUPERABUNDANT CULTURE. IT WAS TO SUCH A CONCORD OF NATURE AND THE IDEAL, TO AN IDYLLIC REALITY, THAT THE CULTURED RENAISSANCE MAN LET HIMSELF BE LED BACK BY HIS OPERATIC IMITATION OF GREEK TRAGEDY. HE MADE USE OF THIS TRAGEDY AS DANTE MADE USE OF VERGIL, IN ORDER TO BE CONDUCTED TO THE GATES OF PARADISE; WHILE FROM THIS POINT HE CONTINUED UNASSISTED AND PASSED OVER FROM AN IMITATION OF THE HIGHEST GREEK ART-FORM TO A ‚ÄÚRESTORATION OF ALL THINGS,‚ÄÙ TO AN IMITATION OF MAN‚ÄÔS ORIGINAL ARTWORLD. WHAT A CHEERFUL CONFIDENCE THERE IS ABOUT THESE DARING ENDEAVORS, IN THE VERY HEART OF THEORETICAL CULTURE!‚ÄÎSOLELY TO BE EXPLAINED BY THE COMFORTING BELIEF, THAT ‚ÄÚMAN-IN-HIMSELF‚ÄÙ IS THE ETERNALLY VIRTUOUS HERO OF THE OPERA, THE ETERNALLY PIPING OR SINGING SHEPHERD, WHO MUST ALWAYS IN THE END REDISCOVER HIMSELF AS SUCH, SHOULD HE EVER AT ANY TIME HAVE REALLY LOST HIMSELF; TO BE CONSIDERED SOLELY AS THE FRUIT OF THAT OPTIMISM, WHICH HERE RISES LIKE A SWEETISHLY SEDUCTIVE COLUMN OF VAPOR FROM THE DEPTH OF THE SOCRATIC WORLD VIEW.

THEREFORE, THE FEATURES OF THE OPERA DO NOT BY ANY MEANS EXHIBIT THE ELEGIAC SORROW OF AN ETERNAL LOSS, BUT RATHER THE CHEERFULNESS OF ETERNAL REDISCOVERY, THE COMFORTABLE DELIGHT IN AN IDYLLIC REALITY WHICH ONE CAN AT LEAST ALWAYS IMAGINE AS REAL. BUT IN THIS PROCESS ONE MAY SOME DAY GRASP THE FACT THAT THIS SUPPOSED REALITY IS NOTHING BUT A FANTASTICALLY SILLY DAWDLING, AT WHICH EVERYONE WHO COULD JUDGE IT BY THE TERRIBLE SERIOUSNESS OF TRUE NATURE, AND COMPARE IT WITH ACTUAL PRIMITIVE SCENES OF THE BEGINNINGS OF MANKIND, WOULD BE IMPELLED TO CALL OUT, NAUSEATED: AWAY WITH THE PHANTOM!

NEVERTHELESS, IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO IMAGINE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE MERELY BY A VIGOROUS SHOUT TO FRIGHTEN AWAY SUCH A PLAYFUL THING AS THE OPERA, AS IF IT WERE A SPECTER. HE WHO WOULD DESTROY THE OPERA MUST TAKE UP THE STRUGGLE AGAINST ALEXANDRIAN CHEERFULNESS, WHICH EXPRESSES ITSELF SO NAIVELY IN OPERA CONCERNING ITS FAVORITE IDEA. INDEED, OPERA IS ITS SPECIFIC FORM OF ART. BUT WHAT MAY ART ITSELF EXPECT FROM THE OPERATION OF AN ART FORM WHOSE BEGINNINGS LIE ENTIRELY OUTSIDE OF THE AESTHETIC PROVINCE AND WHICH HAS STOLEN OVER FROM A HALF-MORAL SPHERE INTO THE ARTISTIC DOMAIN, DECEIVING US ONLY OCCASIONALLY ABOUT ITS HYBRID ORIGIN? BY WHAT SAP IS THIS PARASITIC OPERA NOURISHED, IF NOT BY THAT OF TRUE ART? MUST WE NOT SUPPOSE THAT THE HIGHEST AND, INDEED, THE TRULY SERIOUS TASK OF ART‚ÄÎTO SAVE THE EYE FROM GAZING INTO THE HORRORS OF NIGHT AND TO DELIVER THE SUBJECT BY THE HEALING BALM OF ILLUSION FROM THE SPASMS OF THE AGITATIONS OF THE WILL‚ÄÎMUST DEGENERATE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ITS IDYLLIC SEDUCTIONS AND ALEXANDRIAN FLATTERIES TO BECOME AN EMPTY AND MERELY DISTRACTING DIVERSION? WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE ETERNAL TRUTHS OF THE DIONYSIAN AND APOLLINIAN WHEN THE STYLES ARE MIXED IN THIS FASHION, AS I HAVE SHOWN TO BE THE ESSENCE OF THE STILO RAPPRESENTATIVO? A STYLE IN WHICH MUSIC IS REGARDED AS THE SERVANT, THE TEXT AS THE MASTER, WHERE MUSIC IS COMPARED WITH THE BODY, THE TEXT WITH THE SOUL? WHERE AT BEST THE HIGHEST AIM WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARD A PARAPHRASTIC TONE-PAINTING, JUST AS FORMERLY IN THE NEW ATTIC DITHYRAMB? WHERE MUSIC IS COMPLETELY ALIENATED FROM ITS TRUE DIGNITY AS THE DIONYSIAN MIRROR OF THE WORLD, SO THAT THE ONLY THING LEFT TO IT, AS THE SLAVE OF PHENOMENA, IS TO IMITATE THE FORMAL CHARACTER OF PHENOMENA, AND TO AROUSE A SUPERFICIAL PLEASURE IN THE PLAY OF LINES AND PROPORTIONS. CLOSELY OBSERVED, THIS FATAL INFLUENCE OF THE OPERA ON MUSIC IS SEEN TO COINCIDE EXACTLY WITH THE UNIVERSAL DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN MUSIC; THE OPTIMISM LURKING IN THE GENESIS OF THE OPERA AND IN THE CHARACTER OF THE CULTURE THEREBY REPRESENTED, HAS, WITH ALARMING RAPIDITY, SUCCEEDED IN DIVESTING MUSIC OF ITS DIONYSIAN-COSMIC MISSION AND IMPRESSING ON IT A PLAYFULLY FORMAL AND PLEASURABLE CHARACTER: A CHANGE COMPARABLE TO THE METAMORPHOSIS OF THE AESCHYLEAN MAN INTO THE CHEERFUL ALEXANDRIAN.

IF, HOWEVER, IN THE EXEMPLIFICATION HERE INDICATED, WE HAVE RIGHTLY ASSOCIATED THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE DIONYSIAN SPIRIT WITH A MOST STRIKING, BUT HITHERTO UNEXPLAINED, TRANSFORMATION AND DEGENERATION OF THE HELLENIC MAN‚ÄÎWHAT HOPES MUST REVIVE IN US WHEN THE MOST CERTAIN AUSPICES GUARANTEE THE REVERSE PROCESS, THE GRADUAL AWAKENING OF THE DIONYSIAN SPIRIT IN OUR MODERN WORLD! IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE DIVINE STRENGTH OF HERAKLES SHOULD LANGUISH FOR EVER IN AMPLE BONDAGE TO OMPHALE.2 OUT OF THE DIONYSIAN ROOT OF THE GERMAN SPIRIT A POWER HAS ARISEN WHICH, HAVING NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE PRIMITIVE CONDITIONS OF SOCRATIC CULTURE, CAN NEITHER BE EXPLAINED NOR EXCUSED BY IT, BUT WHICH IS RATHER FELT BY THIS CULTURE AS SOMETHING TERRIBLY INEXPLICABLE AND OVERWHELMINGLY HOSTILE‚ÄÎGERMAN MUSIC AS WE MUST UNDERSTAND IT, PARTICULARLY IN ITS VAST SOLAR ORBIT FROM BACH TO BEETHOVEN, FROM BEETHOVEN TO WAGNER.

EVEN UNDER THE MOST FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT CAN THE KNOWLEDGE-CRAVING SOCRATISM OF OUR DAYS DO WITH THIS DEMON RISING FROM UNFATHOMABLE DEPTHS? NEITHER BY MEANS OF THE FLOURISHES AND ARABESQUES OF OPERATIC MELODY, NOR WITH THE AID OF THE ARITHMETICAL COUNTING BOARD OF FUGUE AND CONTRAPUNTAL DIALECTIC IS THE FORMULA TO BE FOUND BY WHOSE THRICE-POWERFUL LIGHT ONE MIGHT SUBDUE THIS DEMON AND COMPEL IT TO SPEAK. WHAT A SPECTACLE, WHEN OUR LATTER-DAY AESTHETICIANS, WITH A NET OF ‚ÄÚBEAUTY‚ÄÙ PECULIAR TO THEMSELVES, PURSUE AND CLUTCH AT THE GENIUS OF MUSIC WHIRLING BEFORE DISPLAY ACTIVITIES WHICH ARE NOT TO BE JUDGED BY THE STANDARD OF ETERNAL BEAUTY ANY MORE THAN BY THE STANDARD OF THE SUBLIME. LET US BUT OBSERVE THESE PATRONS OF MUSIC AT CLOSE RANGE, AS THEY REALLY ARE, INDEFATIGABLY CRYING: ‚ÄÚBEAUTY! BEAUTY!‚ÄÙ DO THEY REALLY BEAR THE STAMP OF NATURE‚ÄÔS DARLING CHILDREN WHO ARE FOSTERED AND NOURISHED AT THE BREAST OF THE BEAUTIFUL, OR ARE THEY NOT RATHER SEEKING A MENDACIOUS CLOAK FOR THEIR OWN COARSENESS, AN AESTHETICAL PRETEXT FOR THEIR OWN INSENSITIVE SOBRIETY; HERE I AM THINKING OF OTTO JAHN, FOR EXAMPLE.3 BUT LET THE LIAR AND THE HYPOCRITE BEWARE OF GERMAN MUSIC: FOR AMID ALL OUR CULTURE IT IS REALLY THE ONLY GENUINE, PURE, AND PURIFYING FIRE-SPIRIT FROM WHICH AND TOWARD WHICH, AS IN THE TEACHING OF THE GREAT HERACLITUS OF EPHESUS, ALL THINGS MOVE IN A DOUBLE ORBIT: ALL THAT WE NOW CALL CULTURE, EDUCATION, CIVILIZATION, MUST SOME DAY APPEAR BEFORE THE UNERRING JUDGE, DIONYSUS.

LET US RECOLLECT FURTHER THAT KANT AND SCHOPENHAUER MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE SPIRIT OF GERMAN PHILOSOPHY, STREAMING FROM SIMILAR SOURCES, TO DESTROY SCIENTIFIC SOCRATISM‚ÄÔS COMPLACENT DELIGHT IN EXISTENCE BY ESTABLISHING ITS BOUNDARIES; HOW THROUGH THIS DELIMITATION WAS INTRODUCED AN INFINITELY PROFOUNDER AND MORE SERIOUS VIEW OF ETHICAL PROBLEMS AND OF ART, WHICH WE MAY DESIGNATE AS DIONYSIAN WISDOM COMPRISED IN CONCEPTS. TO WHAT THEN DOES THE MYSTERY OF THIS ONENESS OF GERMAN MUSIC AND PHILOSOPHY POINT IF NOT TO A NEW FORM OF EXISTENCE, CONCERNING WHOSE CHARACTER WE CAN ONLY INFORM OURSELVES BY SURMISE FROM HELLENIC ANALOGIES? FOR TO US WHO STAND ON THE BOUNDARY LINE BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT FORMS OF EXISTENCE, THE HELLENIC PROTOTYPE RETAINS THIS IMMEASURABLE VALUE, THAT ALL THESE TRANSITIONS AND STRUGGLES ARE IMPRINTED UPON IT IN A CLASSICALLY INSTRUCTIVE FORM; EXCEPT THAT WE, AS IT WERE, PASS THROUGH THE CHIEF EPOCHS OF THE HELLENIC GENIUS, ANALOGICALLY IN REVERSE ORDER, AND SEEM NOW, FOR INSTANCE, TO BE PASSING BACKWARD FROM THE ALEXANDRIAN AGE TO THE PERIOD OF TRAGEDY. AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE THE FEELING THAT THE BIRTH OF A TRAGIC AGE SIMPLY MEANS A RETURN TO ITSELF OF THE GERMAN SPIRIT, A BLESSED SELF-REDISCOVERY AFTER POWERFUL INTRUSIVE INFLUENCES HAD FOR A LONG TIME COMPELLED IT, LIVING AS IT DID IN A HELPLESS AND UNCHASTE BARBARISM, TO SERVITUDE UNDER THEIR FORM. NOW AT LAST, UPON RETURNING TO THE PRIMITIVE SOURCE OF ITS BEING, IT MAY VENTURE TO STRIDE ALONG BOLDLY AND FREELY BEFORE THE EYES OF ALL NATIONS WITHOUT BEING ATTACHED TO THE LEAD STRINGS OF A ROMANIC CIVILIZATION; IF ONLY IT CAN LEARN CONSTANTLY FROM ONE PEOPLE‚ÄÎTHE GREEKS, FROM WHOM TO BE ABLE TO LEARN AT ALL IS ITSELF A HIGH HONOR AND A RARE DISTINCTION. AND WHEN WERE WE IN GREATER NEED OF THESE HIGHEST OF ALL TEACHERS THAN AT PRESENT, WHEN WE ARE EXPERIENCING A REBIRTH OF TRAGEDY AND ARE IN DANGER ALIKE OF NOT KNOWING WHENCE IT COMES AND OF BEING UNABLE TO MAKE CLEAR TO OURSELVES WHITHER IT TENDS?

SOME DAY, BEFORE AN IMPARTIAL JUDGE, IT MAY BE DECIDED IN WHAT TIME AND IN WHAT MEN THE GERMAN SPIRIT HAS SO FAR STRIVEN MOST RESOLUTELY TO LEARN FROM THE GREEKS; AND IF WE CONFIDENTLY ASSUME THAT THIS UNIQUE PRAISE MUST BE ACCORDED TO THE NOBLEST INTELLECTUAL EFFORTS OF GOETHE, SCHILLER, AND WINCKELMANN, WE SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TO ADD THAT SINCE THEIR TIME AND THE MORE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR EFFORTS, THE ENDEAVOR TO ATTAIN TO CULTURE AND TO THE GREEKS ON THE SAME PATH HAS GROWN INCOMPREHENSIBLY FEEBLER AND FEEBLER. THAT WE MAY NOT DESPAIR UTTERLY OF THE GERMAN SPIRIT, MUST WE NOT CONCLUDE THAT, IN SOME ESSENTIAL MATTER, EVEN THESE CHAMPIONS DID NOT PENETRATE INTO THE CORE OF THE HELLENIC NATURE, TO ESTABLISH A PERMANENT ALLIANCE BETWEEN GERMAN AND GREEK CULTURE? SO AN UNCONSCIOUS RECOGNITION OF THIS SHORTCOMING MAY HAVE PROMPTED THE DISHEARTENING DOUBT, EVEN IN VERY SERIOUS PEOPLE, WHETHER AFTER SUCH PREDECESSORS THEY COULD POSSIBLY ADVANCE FURTHER ON THIS PATH OF CULTURE OR COULD REACH THE GOAL AT ALL. ACCORDINGLY, WE SEE THAT OPINIONS CONCERNING THE VALUE OF THE GREEKS FOR EDUCATION HAVE BEEN DEGENERATING IN THE MOST ALARMING MANNER SINCE THAT TIME. EXPRESSIONS OF COMPASSIONATE CONDESCENSION MAY BE HEARD IN THE MOST VARIED CAMPS OF THE SPIRIT‚ÄÎAND OF LACK OF SPIRIT. ELSEWHERE, INEFFECTUAL RHETORIC PLAYS WITH THE PHRASES ‚ÄÚGREEK HARMONY,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚGREEK BEAUTY,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚGREEK CHEERFULNESS.‚ÄÙ AND THOSE VERY CIRCLES WHOSE DIGNIFIED TASK IT MIGHT BE TO DRAW INDEFATIGABLY FROM THE GREEK RESERVOIR FOR THE GOOD OF GERMAN CULTURE, THE TEACHERS OF THE HIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, HAVE LEARNED BEST TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE GREEKS EASILY AND IN GOOD TIME, OFTEN BY SKEPTICALLY ABANDONING THE HELLENIC IDEAL AND COMPLETELY PERVERTING THE TRUE PURPOSE OF ANTIQUARIAN STUDIES. WHOEVER IN THESE CIRCLES HAS NOT COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED HIMSELF IN HIS ENDEAVOR TO BE A DEPENDABLE CORRECTOR OF OLD TEXTS OR A LINGUISTIC MICROSCOPIST WHO APES NATURAL HISTORY IS PROBABLY TRYING TO ASSIMILATE GREEK ANTIQUITY ‚ÄÚHISTORICALLY,‚ÄÙ ALONG WITH OTHER ANTIQUITIES, AT ANY RATE ACCORDING TO THE METHOD AND WITH THE SUPERCILIOUS AIRS OF OUR PRESENT CULTURED HISTORIOGRAPHY.

THE CULTURAL POWER OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS HAS PERHAPS NEVER BEEN LOWER OR FEEBLER THAN AT PRESENT. THE ‚ÄÚJOURNALIST,‚ÄÙ THE PAPER SLAVE OF THE DAY, TRIUMPHS OVER THE PROFESSOR IN ALL MATTERS PERTAINING TO CULTURE; AND NOTHING REMAINS TO THE LATTER BUT THE METAMORPHOSIS, OFTEN EXPERIENCED BY NOW, OF FLUTTERING ALSO LIKE A CHEERFUL CULTURED BUTTERFLY, WITH THE ‚ÄÚLIGHT ELEGANCE‚ÄÙ PECULIAR TO THIS SPHERE, EMPLOYING THE JOURNALIST‚ÄÔS STYLE. IN WHAT PAINFUL CONFUSION MUST THE CULTURED CLASS OF SUCH A PERIOD GAZE AT THE PHENOMENON WHICH PERHAPS IS TO BE COMPREHENDED ANALOGICALLY ONLY BY MEANS OF THE PROFOUNDEST PRINCIPLE OF THE HITHERTO UNINTELLIGIBLE HELLENIC GENIUS‚ÄÎTHE PHENOMENON OF THE REAWAKENING OF THE DIONYSIAN SPIRIT AND THE REBIRTH OF TRAGEDY?

THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANOTHER PERIOD IN THE HISTORY OF ART IN WHICH SO-CALLED CULTURE AND TRUE ART HAVE BEEN SO ESTRANGED AND OPPOSED AS WE MAY OBSERVE THEM TO BE AT PRESENT. WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY SO FEEBLE A CULTURE HATES TRUE ART; IT FEARS DESTRUCTION FROM ITS HANDS. BUT HAS NOT AN ENTIRE CULTURAL FORM, NAMELY, THE SOCRATIC-ALEXANDRIAN, EXHAUSTED ITSELF AFTER CULMINATING IN SUCH A DAINTILY TAPERING POINT AS OUR PRESENT CULTURE? IF HEROES LIKE GOETHE AND SCHILLER COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BREAKING OPEN THE ENCHANTED GATE WHICH LEADS INTO THE HELLENIC MAGIC MOUNTAIN; IF WITH THEIR MOST DAUNTLESS STRIVING THEY COULD NOT GO BEYOND THE LONGING GAZE WHICH GOETHE‚ÄÔS IPHIGENIA CASTS FROM BARBARIC TAURIS TO HER HOME ACROSS THE OCEAN, WHAT COULD THE EPIGONES OF SUCH HEROES HOPE FOR‚ÄÎUNLESS, AMID THE MYSTIC TONES OF REAWAKENED TRAGIC MUSIC, THE GATE SHOULD OPEN FOR THEM SUDDENLY OF ITS OWN ACCORD, FROM AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SIDE, QUITE OVERLOOKED IN ALL PREVIOUS CULTURAL ENDEAVORS.

LET NO ONE TRY TO BLIGHT OUR FAITH IN A YET-IMPENDING REBIRTH OF HELLENIC ANTIQUITY; FOR THIS ALONE GIVES US HOPE FOR A RENOVATION AND PURIFICATION OF THE GERMAN SPIRIT THROUGH THE FIRE MAGIC OF MUSIC.1 WHAT ELSE COULD WE NAME THAT MIGHT AWAKEN ANY COMFORTING EXPECTATIONS FOR THE FUTURE IN THE MIDST OF THE DESOLATION AND EXHAUSTION OF CONTEMPORARY CULTURE? IN VAIN WE LOOK FOR A SINGLE VIGOROUSLY DEVELOPED ROOT, FOR A SPOT OF FERTILE AND HEALTHY SOIL: EVERYWHERE THERE IS DUST AND SAND; EVERYTHING HAS BECOME RIGID AND LANGUISHES. ONE WHO IS DISCONSOLATE AND LONELY COULD NOT CHOOSE A BETTER SYMBOL THAN THE KNIGHT WITH DEATH AND DEVIL, AS D√ºRER HAS DRAWN HIM FOR US, THE ARMORED KNIGHT WITH THE IRON, HARD LOOK, WHO KNOWS HOW TO PURSUE HIS TERRIBLE PATH, UNDETERRED BY HIS GRUESOME COMPANIONS, AND YET WITHOUT HOPE, ALONE WITH HIS HORSE AND DOG. OUR SCHOPENHAUER WAS SUCH A D√ºRER KNIGHT; HE LACKED ALL HOPE, BUT HE DESIRED TRUTH. HE HAS NO PEERS.

BUT HOW SUDDENLY THE DESERT OF OUR EXHAUSTED CULTURE, JUST DESCRIBED IN SUCH GLOOMY TERMS, IS CHANGED WHEN IT IS TOUCHED BY THE DIONYSIAN MAGIC! A TEMPEST SEIZES EVERYTHING THAT HAS OUTLIVED ITSELF, EVERYTHING THAT IS DECAYED, BROKEN, AND WITHERED, AND, WHIRLING, SHROUDS IT IN A CLOUD OF RED DUST TO CARRY IT INTO THE AIR LIKE A VULTURE. CONFUSED, OUR EYES LOOK AFTER WHAT HAS DISAPPEARED; FOR WHAT THEY SEE HAS BEEN RAISED AS FROM A DEPRESSION INTO GOLDEN LIGHT, SO FULL AND GREEN, SO AMPLY ALIVE, IMMEASURABLE AND FULL OF YEARNING. TRAGEDY IS SEATED AMID THIS EXCESS OF LIFE, SUFFERING, AND PLEASURE, IN SUBLIME ECSTASY, LISTENING TO A DISTANT MELANCHOLY SONG THAT TELLS OF THE MOTHERS OF BEING WHOSE NAMES ARE: DELUSION, WILL, WOE.2

YES, MY FRIENDS, BELIEVE WITH ME IN DIONYSIAN LIFE AND THE REBIRTH OF TRAGEDY. THE AGE OF THE SOCRATIC MAN IS OVER; PUT ON WREATHS OF IVY, PUT THE THYRSUS INTO YOUR HAND, AND DO NOT BE SURPRISED WHEN TIGERS AND PANTHERS LIE DOWN, FAWNING, AT YOUR FEET. ONLY DARE TO BE TRAGIC MEN; FOR YOU ARE TO BE REDEEMED. YOU SHALL ACCOMPANY THE DIONYSIAN PAGEANT FROM INDIA TO GREECE. PREPARE YOURSELVES FOR HARD STRIFE, BUT BELIEVE IN THE MIRACLES OF YOUR GOD.

RETURNING FROM THESE HORTATORY TONES TO THE MOOD BEFITTING CONTEMPLATION, I REPEAT THAT WE CAN LEARN ONLY FROM THE GREEKS WHAT SUCH AN ALMOST MIRACULOUSLY SUDDEN AWAKENING OF TRAGEDY MEANS FOR THE INNERMOST LIFE GROUND OF A PEOPLE. IT IS THE PEOPLE OF THE TRAGIC MYSTERIES THAT FIGHTS THE BATTLES AGAINST THE PERSIANS; AND THE PEOPLE THAT FOUGHT THESE WARS IN TURN NEEDS TRAGEDY AS A NECESSARY POTION TO RECOVER. WHO WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED THAT PRECISELY THIS PEOPLE, AFTER IT HAD BEEN DEEPLY AGITATED THROUGH SEVERAL GENERATIONS BY THE STRONGEST SPASMS OF THE DIONYSIAN DEMON, SHOULD STILL HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF SUCH A UNIFORMLY VIGOROUS EFFUSION OF THE SIMPLEST POLITICAL FEELING, THE MOST NATURAL PATRIOTIC INSTINCTS, AND ORIGINAL MANLY DESIRE TO FIGHT? AFTER ALL, ONE FEELS IN EVERY CASE IN WHICH DIONYSIAN EXCITEMENT GAINS ANY SIGNIFICANT EXTENT HOW THE DIONYSIAN LIBERATION FROM THE FETTERS OF THE INDIVIDUAL FINDS EXPRESSION FIRST OF ALL IN A DIMINUTION OF, IN INDIFFERENCE TO, INDEED, IN HOSTILITY TO, THE POLITICAL INSTINCTS. JUST AS CERTAINLY, APOLLO WHO FORMS STATES IS ALSO THE GENIUS OF THE PRINCIPIUM INDIVIDUATIONIS, AND STATE AND PATRIOTISM CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT AN AFFIRMATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL PERSONALITY. BUT FROM ORGIES A PEOPLE CAN TAKE ONE PATH ONLY, THE PATH TO INDIAN BUDDHISM, AND IN ORDER THAT THIS MAY BE ENDURABLE AT ALL WITH ITS YEARNING FOR THE NOTHING, IT REQUIRES THESE RARE ECSTATIC STATES WITH THEIR ELEVATION ABOVE SPACE, TIME, AND THE INDIVIDUAL. THESE STATES IN TURN DEMAND A PHILOSOPHY THAT TEACHES MEN HOW TO OVERCOME BY THE FORCE OF AN IDEA THE INDESCRIBABLE DISPLEASURE OF THE STATES THAT LIE BETWEEN. WHERE THE POLITICAL DRIVES ARE TAKEN TO BE ABSOLUTELY VALID, IT IS JUST AS NECESSARY THAT A PEOPLE SHOULD GO THE PATH TOWARD THE MOST EXTREME SECULARIZATION WHOSE MOST MAGNIFICENT BUT ALSO MOST TERRIFYING EXPRESSION MAY BE FOUND IN THE ROMAN IMPERIUM.

PLACED BETWEEN INDIA AND ROME, AND PUSHED TOWARD A SEDUCTIVE CHOICE, THE GREEKS SUCCEEDED IN INVENTING A THIRD FORM, IN CLASSICAL PURITY‚ÄÎTO BE SURE, ONE THEY DID NOT LONG USE THEMSELVES, BUT ONE THAT PRECISELY FOR THAT REASON GAINED IMMORTALITY. FOR THAT THE FAVORITES OF THE GODS DIE EARLY, IS TRUE IN ALL THINGS; BUT IT IS JUST AS CERTAIN THAT THEY THEN LIVE ETERNALLY WITH THE GODS. AFTER ALL, ONE SHOULD NOT DEMAND OF WHAT IS NOBLEST OF ALL THAT IT SHOULD HAVE THE DURABLE TOUGHNESS OF LEATHER. THAT STAUNCH PERSEVERANCE WHICH CHARACTERIZED, FOR EXAMPLE, THE NATIONAL INSTINCTS OF THE ROMANS, PROBABLY DOES NOT BELONG AMONG THE NECESSARY PREDICATES OF PERFECTION. BUT LET US ASK BY MEANS OF WHAT REMEDY IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THE GREEKS DURING THEIR GREAT PERIOD, IN SPITE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH OF THEIR DIONYSIAN AND POLITICAL INSTINCTS, NOT TO EXHAUST THEMSELVES EITHER IN ECSTATIC BROODING OR IN A CONSUMING CHASE AFTER WORLDLY POWER AND WORLDLY HONOR, BUT RATHER TO ATTAIN THAT SPLENDID MIXTURE WHICH RESEMBLES A NOBLE WINE IN MAKING ONE FEEL FIERY AND CONTEMPLATIVE AT THE SAME TIME. HERE WE MUST CLEARLY THINK OF THE TREMENDOUS POWER THAT STIMULATED, PURIFIED, AND DISCHARGED THE WHOLE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE: TRAGEDY. WE CANNOT BEGIN TO SENSE ITS HIGHEST VALUE UNTIL IT CONFRONTS US, AS IT DID THE GREEKS, AS THE QUINTESSENCE OF ALL PROPHYLACTIC POWERS OF HEALING, AS THE MEDIATOR THAT WORKED AMONG THE STRONGEST AND IN THEMSELVES MOST FATAL QUALITIES OF THE PEOPLE.

TRAGEDY ABSORBS THE HIGHEST ECSTASIES OF MUSIC, SO THAT IT TRULY BRINGS MUSIC, BOTH AMONG THE GREEKS AND AMONG US, TO ITS PERFECTION; BUT THEN IT PLACES THE TRAGIC MYTH AND THE TRAGIC HERO NEXT TO IT, AND HE, LIKE A POWERFUL TITAN, TAKES THE WHOLE DIONYSIAN WORLD UPON HIS BACK AND THUS RELIEVES US OF THIS BURDEN. ON THE OTHER HAND, BY MEANS OF THE SAME TRAGIC MYTH, IN THE PERSON OF THE TRAGIC HERO; IT KNOWS HOW TO REDEEM US FROM THE GREEDY THIRST FOR THIS EXISTENCE, AND WITH AN ADMONISHING GESTURE IT REMINDS US OF ANOTHER EXISTENCE AND A HIGHER PLEASURE FOR WHICH THE STRUGGLING HERO PREPARES HIMSELF BY MEANS OF HIS DESTRUCTION, NOT BY MEANS OF HIS TRIUMPHS. BETWEEN THE UNIVERSAL VALIDITY OF ITS MUSIC AND THE LISTENER, RECEPTIVE IN HIS DIONYSIAN STATE, TRAGEDY PLACES A SUBLIME PARABLE, THE MYTH, AND DECEIVES THE LISTENER INTO FEELING THAT THE MUSIC IS MERELY THE HIGHEST MEANS TO BRING LIFE INTO THE VIVID WORLD OF MYTH. RELYING ON THIS NOBLE DECEPTION, IT MAY NOW MOVE ITS LIMBS IN DITHYRAMBIC DANCES AND YIELD UNHESITATINGLY TO AN ECSTATIC FEELING OF FREEDOM IN WHICH IT COULD NOT DARE TO WALLOW AS PURE MUSIC WITHOUT THIS DECEPTION. THE MYTH PROTECTS US AGAINST THE MUSIC, WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND IT ALONE GIVES MUSIC THE HIGHEST FREEDOM. IN RETURN, MUSIC IMPARTS TO THE TRAGIC MYTH AN INTENSE AND CONVINCING METAPHYSICAL SIGNIFICANCE THAT WORD AND IMAGE WITHOUT THIS SINGULAR HELP COULD NEVER HAVE ATTAINED. AND ABOVE ALL, IT IS THROUGH MUSIC THAT THE TRAGIC SPECTATOR IS OVERCOME BY AN ASSURED PREMONITION OF A HIGHEST PLEASURE1 ATTAINED THROUGH DESTRUCTION AND NEGATION, SO HE FEELS AS IF THE INNERMOST ABYSS OF THINGS SPOKE TO HIM PERCEPTIBLY.

IF THESE LAST SENTENCES HAVE PERHAPS MANAGED TO GIVE ONLY A PRELIMINARY EXPRESSION TO THESE DIFFICULT IDEAS AND ARE IMMEDIATELY INTELLIGIBLE ONLY TO FEW, I NEVERTHELESS MAY NOT DESIST AT THIS POINT FROM TRYING TO STIMULATE MY FRIENDS TO FURTHER EFFORTS AND MUST ASK THEM TO USE A SINGLE EXAMPLE OF OUR COMMON EXPERIENCE IN ORDER TO PREPARE THEMSELVES FOR A GENERAL INSIGHT. IN GIVING THIS EXAMPLE, I MUST NOT APPEAL TO THOSE WHO USE THE IMAGES OF WHAT HAPPENS ON THE STAGE, THE WORDS AND EMOTIONS OF THE ACTING PERSONS, IN ORDER TO APPROACH WITH THEIR HELP THE MUSICAL FEELING; FOR THESE PEOPLE DO NOT SPEAK MUSIC AS THEIR MOTHER TONGUE AND, IN SPITE OF THIS HELP, NEVER GET BEYOND THE ENTRANCE HALLS OF MUSICAL PERCEPTION, WITHOUT EVER BEING ABLE TO AS MUCH AS TOUCH THE INNER SANCTUM. SOME OF THEM, LIKE GERVINUS,2 DO NOT EVEN REACH THE ENTRANCE HALLS. I MUST APPEAL ONLY TO THOSE WHO, IMMEDIATELY RELATED TO MUSIC, HAVE IN IT, AS IT WERE, THEIR MOTHERLY WOMB, AND ARE RELATED TO THINGS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH UNCONSCIOUS MUSICAL RELATIONS. TO THESE GENUINE MUSICIANS I DIRECT THE QUESTION WHETHER THEY CAN IMAGINE A HUMAN BEING WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO PERCEIVE THE THIRD ACT OF TRISTAN AND ISOLDE, WITHOUT ANY AID OF WORD AND IMAGE, PURELY AS A TREMENDOUS SYMPHONIC MOVEMENT, WITHOUT EXPIRING IN A SPASMODIC UNHARNESSING OF ALL THE WINGS OF THE SOUL?

SUPPOSE A HUMAN BEING HAS THUS PUT HIS EAR, AS IT WERE, TO THE HEART CHAMBER OF THE WORLD WILL AND FELT THE ROARING DESIRE FOR EXISTENCE POURING FROM THERE INTO ALL THE VEINS OF THE WORLD, AS A THUNDERING CURRENT OR AS THE GENTLEST BROOK, DISSOLVING INTO A MIST‚ÄÎHOW COULD HE FAIL TO BREAK SUDDENLY? HOW COULD HE ENDURE TO PERCEIVE THE ECHO OF INNUMERABLE SHOUTS OF PLEASURE AND WOE IN THE ‚ÄÚWIDE SPACE OF THE WORLD NIGHT,‚ÄÙ ENCLOSED IN THE WRETCHED GLASS CAPSULE OF THE HUMAN INDIVIDUAL, WITHOUT INEXORABLY FLEEING TOWARD HIS PRIMORDIAL HOME, AS HE HEARS THIS SHEPHERD‚ÄÔS DANCE OF METAPHYSICS? BUT IF SUCH A WORK COULD NEVERTHELESS BE PERCEIVED AS A WHOLE, WITHOUT DENIAL OF INDIVIDUAL EXISTENCE; IF SUCH A CREATION COULD BE CREATED WITHOUT SMASHING ITS CREATOR‚ÄÎWHENCE DO WE TAKE THE SOLUTION OF SUCH A CONTRADICTION?

HERE THE TRAGIC MYTH AND THE TRAGIC HERO INTERVENE BETWEEN OUR HIGHEST MUSICAL EMOTION AND THIS MUSIC‚ÄÎAT BOTTON ONLY AS SYMBOLS OF THE MOST UNIVERSAL FACTS, OF WHICH ONLY MUSIC CAN SPEAK SO DIRECTLY. BUT IF OUR FEELINGS WERE THOSE OF ENTIRELY DIONYSIAN BEINGS, MYTH AS A SYMBOL WOULD REMAIN TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE AND UNNOTICED, AND WOULD NEVER FOR A MOMENT KEEP US FROM LISTENING TO THE RE-ECHO OF THE UNIVERSALIA ANTE REM.3 YET HERE THE APOLLINIAN POWER ERUPTS TO RESTORE THE ALMOST SHATTERED INDIVIDUAL WITH THE HEALING BALM OF BLISSFUL ILLUSION: SUDDENLY WE IMAGINE WE SEE ONLY TRISTAN, MOTIONLESS, ASKING HIMSELF DULLY: ‚ÄÚTHE OLD TUNE, WHY DOES IT WAKE ME?‚ÄÙ AND WHAT ONCE SEEMED TO US LIKE A HOLLOW SIGH FROM THE CORE OF BEING NOW MERELY WANTS TO TELL US HOW ‚ÄÚDESOLATE AND EMPTY THE SEA.‚ÄÙ4 AND WHERE, BREATHLESS, WE ONCE THOUGHT WE WERE BEING EXTINGUISHED IN A CONVULSIVE DISTENTION OF ALL OUR FEELINGS, AND LITTLE REMAINED TO TIE US TO OUR PRESENT EXISTENCE, WE NOW HEAR AND SEE ONLY THE HERO WOUNDED TO DEATH, YET NOT DYING, WITH HIS DESPAIRING CRY: ‚ÄÚLONGING! LONGING! IN DEATH STILL LONGING! FOR VERY LONGING NOT DYING!‚ÄÙ AND WHERE, FORMERLY AFTER SUCH AN EXCESS AND SUPERABUNDANCE OF CONSUMING AGONIES, THE JUBILATION OF THE HORN CUT THROUGH OUR HEARTS ALMOST LIKE THE ULTIMATE AGONY, THE REJOICING KURWENAL NOW STANDS BETWEEN US AND THIS ‚ÄÚJUBILATION IN ITSELF,‚ÄÙ HIS FACE TURNED TOWARD THE SHIP WHICH CARRIES ISOLDE. HOWEVER POWERFULLY PITY AFFECTS US, IT NEVERTHELESS SAVES US IN A WAY FROM THE PRIMORDIAL SUFFERING OF THE WORLD, JUST AS THE SYMBOLIC IMAGE OF THE MYTH SAVES US FROM THE IMMEDIATE PERCEPTION OF THE HIGHEST WORLD-IDEA, JUST AS THOUGHT AND WORD SAVE US FROM THE UNINHIBITED EFFUSION OF THE UNCONSCIOUS WILL. THE GLORIOUS APOLLINIAN ILLUSION MAKES IT APPEAR AS IF EVEN THE TONE WORLD CONFRONTED US AS A SCULPTED WORLD, AS IF THE FATE OF TRISTAN AND √ÅSOLDE HAD BEEN FORMED AND MOLDED IN IT, TOO, AS IN AN EXCEEDINGLY TENDER AND EXPRESSIVE MATERIAL.

THUS THE APOLLINIAN TEARS US OUT OF THE DIONYSIAN UNIVERSALITY AND LETS US FIND DELIGHT IN INDIVIDUALS; IT ATTACHES OUR PITY TO THEM, AND BY MEANS OF THEM IT SATISFIES OUR SENSE OF BEAUTY WHICH LONGS FOR GREAT AND SUBLIME FORMS; IT PRESENTS IMAGES OF LIFE TO US, AND INCITES US TO COMPREHEND IN THOUGHT THE CORE OF LIFE THEY CONTAIN. WITH THE IMMENSE IMPACT OF THE IMAGE, THE CONCEPT, THE ETHICAL TEACHING, AND THE SYMPATHETIC EMOTION, THE APOLLINIAN TEARS MAN FROM HIS ORGIASTIC SELF-ANNIHILATION AND BLINDS HIM TO THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE DIONYSIAN PROCESS, DELUDING HIM INTO THE BELIEF THAT HE IS SEEING A SINGLE IMAGE OF THE WORLD (TRISTAN AND ISOLDE, FOR INSTANCE), AND THAT, THROUGH MUSIC, HE IS MERELY SUPPOSED TO SEE IT STILL BETTER AND MORE PROFOUNDLY. WHAT CAN THE HEALING MAGIC OF APOLLO NOT ACCOMPLISH WHEN IT CAN EVEN CREATE THE ILLUSION THAT THE DIONYSIAN IS REALLY IN THE SERVICE OF THE APOLLINIAN AND CAPABLE OF ENHANCING ITS EFFECTS‚ÄÎAS IF MUSIC WERE ESSENTIALLY THE ART OF PRESENTING AN APOLLINIAN CONTENT?

BY MEANS OF THE PRE-ESTABLISHED HARMONY BETWEEN PERFECT DRAMA AND ITS MUSIC, THE DRAMA ATTAINS A SUPERLATIVE VIVIDNESS UNATTAINABLE IN MERE SPOKEN DRAMA. IN THE INDEPENDENTLY MOVING LINES OF THE MELODY ALL THE LIVING FIGURES OF THE SCENE SIMPLIFY THEMSELVES BEFORE US TO THE DISTINCTNESS OF CURVED LINES, AND THE HARMONIES OF THESE LINES SYMPATHIZE IN A MOST DELICATE MANNER WITH THE EVENTS ON THE STAGE. THESE HARMONIES MAKE THE RELATIONS OF THINGS IMMEDIATELY PERCEPTIBLE TO US IN A SENSUOUS, BY NO MEANS ABSTRACT MANNER, AND THUS WE PERCEIVE THAT IT IS ONLY IN THESE RELATIONS THAT THE ESSENCE OF A CHARACTER AND OF A MELODIC LINE IS REVEALED CLEARLY. AND WHILE MUSIC THUS COMPELS US TO SEE MORE AND MORE PROFOUNDLY THAN USUAL, AND WE SEE THE ACTION ON THE STAGE AS A DELICATE WEB, THE WORLD OF THE STAGE IS EXPANDED INFINITELY AND ILLUMINATED FOR OUR SPIRITUALIZED EYE. HOW COULD A WORD-POET FURNISH ANYTHING ANALOGOUS, WHEN HE STRIVES TO ATTAIN THIS INTERNAL EXPANSION AND ILLUMINATION OF THE VISIBLE STAGE-WORLD BY MEANS OF A MUCH MORE IMPERFECT MECHANISM, INDIRECTLY, PROCEEDING FROM WORD AND CONCEPT? ALTHOUGH MUSICAL TRAGEDY ALSO AVAILS ITSELF OF THE WORD, IT CAN AT THE SAME TIME PLACE BESIDE IT THE BASIS AND ORIGIN OF THE WORD, MAKING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WORD CLEAR TO US, FROM THE INSIDE.

CONCERNING THE PROCESS JUST DESCRIBED, HOWEVER, WE MAY STILL SAY WITH EQUAL ASSURANCE THAT IT IS MERELY A GLORIOUS APPEARANCE, NAMELY, THE AFOREMENTIONED APOLLINIAN ILLUSION WHOSE INFLUENCE AIMS TO DELIVER US FROM THE DIONYSIAN FLOOD AND EXCESS. FOR, AT BOTTOM, THE RELATION OF MUSIC TO DRAMA IS PRECISELY THE REVERSE: MUSIC IS THE REAL IDEA OF THE WORLD, DRAMA IS BUT THE REFLECTION OF THIS IDEA, A SINGLE SILHOUETTE OF IT. THE IDENTITY BETWEEN THE MELODY AND THE LIVING FIGURE, BETWEEN THE HARMONY AND THE CHARACTER RELATIONS OF THAT FIGURE, IS TRUE IN A SENSE OPPOSITE TO WHAT ONE WOULD SUPPOSE ON THE CONTEMPLATION OF MUSICAL TRAGEDY. EVEN IF WE AGITATE AND ENLIVEN THE FIGURE IN THE MOST VISIBLE MANNER, AND ILLUMINATE IT FROM WITHIN, IT STILL REMAINS MERELY A PHENOMENON FROM WHICH NO BRIDGE LEADS US TO TRUE REALITY, INTO THE HEART OF THE WORLD. BUT MUSIC SPEAKS OUT OF THIS HEART; AND THOUGH COUNTLESS PHENOMENA OF THE KIND WERE TO ACCOMPANY THIS MUSIC, THEY COULD NEVER EXHAUST ITS ESSENCE, BUT WOULD ALWAYS BE NOTHING MORE THAN ITS EXTERNALIZED COPIES.

AS FOR THE INTRICATE RELATIONSHIP OF MUSIC AND DRAMA, NOTHING CAN BE EXPLAINED, WHILE EVERYTHING MAY BE CONFUSED, BY THE POPULAR AND THOROUGHLY FALSE CONTRAST OF SOUL AND BODY; BUT THE UNPHILOSOPHICAL CRUDENESS OF THIS CONTRAST SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME‚ÄÎWHO KNOWS FOR WHAT REASONS‚ÄÎA READILY ACCEPTED ARTICLE OF FAITH AMONG OUR AESTHETICIANS, WHILE THEY HAVE LEARNED NOTHING OF THE CONTRAST OF THE PHENOMENON AND THE THING-IN-ITSELF‚ÄÎOR, FOR EQUALLY UNKNOWN REASONS, HAVE NOT CARED TO LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

SHOULD OUR ANALYSIS HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT THE APOLLINIAN ELEMENT IN TRAGEDY HAS BY MEANS OF ITS ILLUSION GAINED A COMPLETE VICTORY OVER THE PRIMORIDAL DIONYSIAN ELEMENT OF MUSIC, MAKING MUSIC SUBSERVIENT TO ITS AIMS, NAMELY, TO MAKE THE DRAMA AS VIVID AS POSSIBLE‚ÄÎIT WOULD CERTAINLY BE NECESSARY TO ADD A VERY IMPORTANT QUALIFICATION: AT THE MOST ESSENTIAL POINT THIS APOLLINIAN ILLUSION IS BROKEN AND ANNIHILATED. THE DRAMA THAT, WITH THE AID OF MUSIC, UNFOLDS ITSELF BEFORE US WITH SUCH INWARDLY ILLUMINED DISTINCTNESS IN ALL ITS MOVEMENTS AND FIGURES, AS IF WE SAW THE TEXTURE COMING INTO BEING ON THE LOOM AS THE SHUTTLE FLIES TO AND FRO‚ÄÎATTAINS AS A WHOLE AN EFFECT THAT TRANSCENDS ALL APOLLINIAN ARTISTIC EFFECTS. IN THE TOTAL EFFECT OF TRAGEDY, THE DIONYSIAN PREDOMINATES ONCE AGAIN. TRAGEDY CLOSES WITH A SOUND WHICH COULD NEVER COME FROM THE REALM OF APOLLINIAN ART. AND THUS THE APOLLINIAN ILLUSION REVEALS ITSELF AS WHAT IT REALLY IS‚ÄÎTHE VEILING DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TRAGEDY OF THE REAL DIONYSIAN EFFECT; BUT THE LATTER IS SO POWERFUL THAT IT ENDS BY FORCING THE APOLLINIAN DRAMA ITSELF INTO A SPHERE WHERE IT BEGINS TO SPEAK WITH DIONYSIAN WISDOM AND EVEN DENIES ITSELF AND ITS APOLLINIAN VISIBILITY. THUS THE INTRICATE RELATION OF THE APOLLINIAN AND THE DIONYSIAN IN TRAGEDY MAY REALLY BE SYMBOLIZED BY A FRATERNAL UNION OF THE TWO DEITIES: DIONYSUS SPEAKS THE LANGUAGE OF APOLLO; AND APOLLO, FINALLY THE LANGUAGE OF DIONYSUS; AND SO THE HIGHEST GOAL OF TRAGEDY AND OF ALL ART IS ATTAINED.





22


LET THE ATTENTIVE FRIEND IMAGINE THE EFFECT OF A TRUE MUSICAL TRAGEDY PURELY AND SIMPLY, AS HE KNOWS IT FROM EXPERIENCE. I THINK I HAVE SO PORTRAYED THE PHENOMENON OF THIS EFFECT IN BOTH ITS PHASES THAT HE CAN NOW INTERPRET HIS OWN EXPERIENCES. FOR HE WILL RECOLLECT HOW WITH REGARD TO THE MYTH WHICH PASSED IN FRONT OF HIM, HE FELT HIMSELF EXALTED TO A KIND OF OMNISCIENCE, AS IF HIS VISUAL FACULTY WERE NO LONGER MERELY A SURFACE FACULTY BUT CAPABLE OF PENETRATING INTO THE INTERIOR, AND AS IF HE NOW SAW BEFORE HIM, WITH THE AID OF MUSIC, THE WAVES OF THE WILL, THE CONFLICT OF MOTIVES, AND THE SWELLING FLOOD OF THE PASSIONS, SENSUOUSLY VISIBLE, AS IT WERE, LIKE A MULTITUDE OF VIVIDLY MOVING LINES AND FIGURES; AND HE FELT HE COULD DIP INTO THE MOST DELICATE SECRETS OF UNCONSCIOUS EMOTIONS. WHILE HE THUS BECOMES CONSCIOUS OF THE HIGHEST EXALTATION OF HIS INSTINCTS FOR CLARITY AND TRANSFIGURATION, HE NEVERTHELESS FEELS JUST AS DEFINITELY THAT THIS LONG SERIES OF APOLLINIAN ARTISTIC EFFECTS STILL DOES NOT GENERATE THAT BLESSED CONTINUANCE IN WILL-LESS CONTEMPLATION WHICH THE PLASTIC ARTIST AND THE EPIC POET, THAT IS TO SAY, THE STRICTLY APOLLINIAN ARTISTS, EVOKE IN HIM WITH THEIR ARTISTIC PRODUCTIONS: TO WIT, THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE WORLD OF THE INDIVIDUATIO ATTAINED BY THIS CONTEMPLATION‚ÄÎWHICH IS THE CLIMAX AND ESSENCE OF APOLLINIAN ART. HE BEHOLDS THE TRANSFIGURED WORLD OF THE STAGE AND NEVERTHELESS DENIES IT. HE SEES THE TRAGIC HERO BEFORE HIM IN EPIC CLEARNESS AND BEAUTY, AND NEVERTHELESS REJOICES IN HIS ANNIHILATION. HE COMPREHENDS THE ACTION DEEP DOWN, AND YET LIKES TO FLEE INTO THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE. HE FEELS THE ACTIONS OF THE HERO TO BE JUSTIFIED, AND IS NEVERTHELESS STILL MORE ELATED WHEN THESE ACTIONS ANNIHILATE THEIR AGENT. HE SHUDDERS AT THE SUFFERINGS WHICH WILL BEFALL THE HERO, AND YET ANTICIPATES IN THEM A HIGHER, MUCH MORE OVERPOWERING JOY. HE SEES MORE EXTENSIVELY AND PROFOUNDLY THAN EVER, AND YET WISHES HE WERE BLIND.

HOW MUST WE DERIVE THIS CURIOUS INTERNAL BIFURCATION, THIS BLUNTING OF THE APOLLINIAN POINT, IF NOT FROM THE DIONYSIAN MAGIC THAT, THOUGH APPARENTLY EXCITING THE APOLLINIAN EMOTIONS TO THEIR HIGHEST PITCH, STILL RETAINS THE POWER TO FORCE INTO ITS SERVICE HIS EXCESS OF APOLLINIAN FORCE?

THE TRAGIC MYTH IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD ONLY AS A SYMBOLIZATION OF DIONYSIAN WISDOM THROUGH APOLLINIAN ARTIFICES. THE MYTH LEADS THE WORLD OF PHENOMENA TO ITS LIMITS WHERE IT DENIES ITSELF AND SEEKS TO FLEE BACK AGAIN INTO THE WOMB OF THE TRUE AND ONLY REALITY, WHERE IT THEN SEEMS TO COMMENCE ITS METAPHYSICAL SWANSONG, LIKE ISOLDE:

IN THE RAPTURE OCEAN‚ÄÔS

BILLOWING ROLL,

IN THE FRAGRANCE WAVES‚ÄÔ

RINGING SOUND,

IN THE WORLD BREATH‚ÄÔS

WAFTING WHOLE‚ÄÎ

TO DROWN, TO SINK‚ÄÎ

UNCONSCIOUS‚ÄÎHIGHEST JOY!1



THUS WE USE THE EXPERIENCES OF THE TRULY AESTHETIC LISTENER TO BRING TO MIND THE TRAGIC ARTIST HIMSELF AS HE CREATES HIS FIGURES LIKE A FECUND DIVINITY OF INDIVIDUATION (SO HIS WORK CAN HARDLY BE UNDERSTOOD AS AN ‚ÄÚIMITATION OF NATURE‚ÄÙ) AND AS HIS VAST DIONYSIAN IMPULSE THEN DEVOURS HIS ENTIRE WORLD OF PHENOMENA, IN ORDER TO LET US SENSE BEYOND IT, AND THROUGH ITS DESTRUCTION, THE HIGHEST ARTISTIC PRIMAL JOY, IN THE BOSOM OF THE PRIMORDIALLY ONE. OF COURSE, OUR AESTHETICIANS HAVE NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT THIS RETURN TO THE PRIMORDIAL HOME, OR THE FRATERNAL UNION OF THE TWO ART-DEITIES, NOR OF THE EXCITEMENT OF THE HEARER WHICH IS APOLLINIAN AS WELL AS DIONYSIAN; BUT THEY NEVER TIRE OF CHARACTERIZING THE STRUGGLE OF THE HERO WITH FATE, THE TRIUMPH OF THE MORAL WORLD ORDER, OR THE PURGATION OF THE EMOTIONS THROUGH TRAGEDY, AS THE ESSENCE OF THE TRAGIC. AND THEIR INDEFATIGABILITY MAKES ME THINK THAT PERHAPS THEY ARE NOT AESTHETICALLY SENSITIVE AT ALL, BUT REACT MERELY AS MORAL BEINGS WHEN LISTENING TO A TRAGEDY.

NEVER SINCE ARISTOTLE HAS AN EXPLANATION OF THE TRAGIC EFFECT BEEN OFFERED FROM WHICH AESTHETIC STATES OR AN AESTHETIC ACTIVITY OF THE LISTENER COULD BE INFERRED. NOW THE SERIOUS EVENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO PROMPT PITY AND FEAR TO DISCHARGE THEMSELVES IN A WAY THAT RELIEVES US; NOW WE ARE SUPPOSED TO FEEL ELEVATED AND INSPIRED BY THE TRIUMPH OF GOOD AND NOBLE PRINCIPLES, AT THE SACRIFICE OF THE HERO IN THE INTEREST OF A MORAL VISION OF THE UNIVERSE. I AM SURE THAT FOR COUNTLESS MEN PRECISELY THIS, AND ONLY THIS, IS THE EFFECT OF TRAGEDY, BUT IT PLAINLY FOLLOWS THAT ALL THESE MEN, TOGETHER WITH THEIR INTERPRETING AESTHETICIANS, HAVE HAD NO EXPERIENCE OF TRAGEDY, AS A SUPREME ART.

THE PATHOLOGICAL DISCHARGE, THE CATHARSIS OF ARISTOTLE, OF WHICH PHILOLOGISTS ARE NOT SURE WHETHER IT SHOULD BE INCLUDED AMONG MEDICAL OR MORAL PHENOMENA, RECALLS A REMARKABLE NOTION OF GOETHE‚ÄÔS. ‚ÄÚWITHOUT A LIVELY PATHOLOGICAL INTEREST,‚ÄÙ HE SAYS, ‚ÄÚI, TOO, HAVE NEVER YET SUCCEEDED IN ELABORATING A TRAGIC SITUATION OF ANY KIND, AND HENCE I HAVE RATHER AVOIDED THAN SOUGHT IT. CAN IT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN YET ANOTHER MERIT OF THE ANCIENTS THAT THE DEEPEST PATHOS WAS WITH THEM MERELY AESTHETIC PLAY, WHILE WITH US THE TRUTH OF NATURE MUST CO-OPERATE IN ORDER TO PRODUCE SUCH A WORK?‚ÄÙ

WE CAN NOW ANSWER THIS PROFOUND FINAL QUESTION IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AFTER OUR GLORIOUS EXPERIENCES, HAVING FOUND TO OUR ASTONISHMENT THAT THE DEEPEST PATHOS CAN INDEED BE MERELY AESTHETIC PLAY IN THE CASE OF MUSICAL TRAGEDY. THEREFORE WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN BELIEVING THAT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THE PRIMAL PHENOMENON OF THE TRAGIC CAN BE DESCRIBED WITH SOME DEGREE OF SUCCESS. ANYONE WHO STILL PERSISTS IN TALKING ONLY OF THOSE VICARIOUS EFFECTS PROCEEDING FROM EXTRA-AESTHETIC SPHERES, AND WHO DOES NOT FEEL THAT HE IS ABOVE THE PATHOLOGICAL-MORAL PROCESS, SHOULD DESPAIR OF HIS AESTHETIC NATURE: SHOULD WE RECOMMEND TO HIM AS AN INNOCENT EQUIVALENT THE INTERPRETATION OF SHAKESPEARE AFTER THE MANNER OF GERVINUS AND THE DILIGENT SEARCH FOR POETIC JUSTICE?2

THUS THE AESTHETIC LISTENER IS ALSO REBORN WITH THE REBIRTH OF TRAGEDY. IN HIS PLACE IN THE THEATER, A CURIOUS QUID PRO QUO3 USED TO SIT WITH HALF MORAL AND HALF SCHOLARLY PRETENSIONS‚ÄÎTHE ‚ÄÚCRITIC.‚ÄÙ EVERYTHING IN HIS SPHERE SO FAR HAS BEEN ARTIFICIAL AND MERELY WHITEWASHED WITH AN APPEARANCE OF LIFE. THE PERFORMING ARTIST WAS REALLY AT A LOSS HOW TO DEAL WITH A LISTENER WHO COMPORTED HIMSELF SO CRITICALLY; SO HE, AS WELL AS THE DRAMATIST OR OPERATIC COMPOSER WHO INSPIRED HIM, SEARCHED ANXIOUSLY FOR THE LAST REMAINS OF LIFE IN A BEING SO PRETENTIOUSLY BARREN AND INCAPABLE OF ENJOYMENT. SO FAR, HOWEVER, SUCH ‚ÄÚCRITICS‚ÄÙ HAVE CONSTITUTED THE AUDIENCE: THE STUDENT, THE SCHOOLBOY, EVEN THE MOST INNOCUOUS FEMALE HAD BEEN UNWITTINGLY PREPARED BY EDUCATION AND NEWSPAPERS FOR THIS KIND OF PERCEPTION OF WORKS OF ART. CONFRONTED WITH SUCH A PUBLIC, THE NOBLER NATURES AMONG THE ARTISTS COUNTED UPON EXCITING THEIR MORAL-RELIGIOUS EMOTIONS, AND THE APPEAL TO THE MORAL WORLD-ORDER INTERVENED VICARIOUSLY WHERE SOME POWERFUL ARTISTIC MAGIC OUGHT TO ENRAPTURE THE GENUINE LISTENER. OR SOME MORE IMPOSING, OR AT ALL EVENTS EXCITING, TREND OF THE CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL AND SOCIAL WORLD WAS SO VIVIDLY PRESENTED BY THE DRAMATIST THAT THE LISTENER COULD FORGET HIS CRITICAL EXHAUSTION AND ABANDON HIMSELF TO EMOTIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE FELT IN PATRIOTIC OR WARLIKE MOMENTS, OR BEFORE THE TRIBUNE OF PARLIAMENT, OR AT THE CONDEMNATION OF CRIME AND VICE‚ÄÎAN ALIENATION FROM THE TRUE AIMS OF ART THAT SOMETIMES HAD TO RESULT IN AN OUTRIGHT CULT OF TENDENTIOUSNESS. BUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT IS WHAT HAS ALWAYS HAPPENED TO ALL ARTIFICIAL ARTS: A RAPID DEGENERATION OF SUCH TENDENTIOUSNESS. THE ATTEMPT, FOR EXAMPLE, TO USE THE THEATER AS AN INSTITUTION FOR THE MORAL EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE, STILL TAKEN SERIOUSLY IN SCHILLER‚ÄÔS TIME, IS ALREADY RECKONED AMONG THE INCREDIBLE ANTIQUES OF A DATED TYPE OF EDUCATION. WHILE THE CRITIC GOT THE UPPER HAND IN THE THEATER AND CONCERT HALL, THE JOURNALIST IN THE SCHOOLS, AND THE PRESS IN SOCIETY, ART DEGENERATED INTO A PARTICULARLY LOWLY TOPIC OF CONVERSATION, AND AESTHETIC CRITICISM WAS USED AS A MEANS OF UNITING A VAIN, DISTRACTED, SELFISH, AND MOREOVER PITEOUSLY UNORIGINAL SOCIABILITY WHOSE CHARACTER IS SUGGESTED BY SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS PARABLE OF THE PORCUPINES.4 AS A RESULT, ART HAS NEVER BEEN SO MUCH TALKED ABOUT AND SO LITTLE ESTEEMED. BUT IS IT STILL POSSIBLE TO HAVE INTERCOURSE WITH A PERSON CAPABLE OF CONVERSING ABOUT BEETHOVEN OR SHAKESPEARE?5 LET EACH ANSWER THIS QUESTION ACCORDING TO HIS OWN FEELINGS: HE WILL AT ANY RATE SHOW BY HIS ANSWER HIS CONCEPTION OF ‚ÄÚCULTURE,‚ÄÙ PROVIDED HE AT LEAST TRIES TO ANSWER THE QUESTION, AND HAS NOT ALREADY BECOME DUMFOUNDED WITH ASTONISHMENT.

ON THE OTHER HAND, MANY A BEING MORE NOBLY AND DELICATELY ENDOWED BY NATURE, THOUGH HE MAY HAVE GRADUALLY BECOME A CRITICAL BARBARIAN IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED, MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE UNEXPECTED AS WELL AS TOTALLY UNINTELLIGIBLE EFFECT THAT A SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE OF LOHENGRIN, FOR EXAMPLE, HAD ON HIM‚ÄÎEXCEPT THAT PERHAPS THERE WAS NO HELPFUL INTERPRETING HAND TO GUIDE HIM; SO THE INCOMPREHENSIBLY DIFFERENT AND ALTOGETHER INCOMPARABLE SENSATION THAT THRILLED HIM REMAINED ISOLATED AND, LIKE A MYSTERIOUS STAR, BECAME EXTINCT AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF BRILLIANCE. BUT IT WAS THEN THAT HE HAD AN INKLING OF WHAT AN AESTHETIC LISTENER IS.

WHOEVER WISHES TO TEST RIGOROUSLY TO WHAT EXTENT HE HIMSELF IS RELATED TO THE TRUE AESTHETIC LISTENER OR BELONGS TO THE COMMUNITY OF THE SOCRATIC-CRITICAL PERSONS NEEDS ONLY TO EXAMINE SINCERELY THE FEELING WITH WHICH HE ACCEPTS MIRACLES REPRESENTED ON THE STAGE: WHETHER HE FEELS HIS HISTORICAL SENSE, WHICH INSISTS ON STRICT PSYCHOLOGICAL CAUSALITY, INSULTED BY THEM, WHETHER HE MAKES A BENEVOLENT CONCESSION AND ADMITS THE MIRACLE AS A PHENOMENON INTELLIGIBLE TO CHILDHOOD BUT ALIEN TO HIM, OR WHETHER HE EXPERIENCES ANYTHING ELSE. FOR IN THIS WAY HE WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE TO WHAT EXTENT HE IS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING MYTH AS A CONCENTRATED IMAGE OF THE WORLD THAT, AS A CONDENSATION OF PHENOMENA, CANNOT DISPENSE WITH MIRACLES. IT IS PROBABLE, HOWEVER, THAT ALMOST EVERYONE, UPON CLOSE EXAMINATION, FINDS THAT THE CRITICAL-HISTORICAL SPIRIT OF OUR CULTURE HAS SO AFFECTED HIM THAT HE CAN ONLY MAKE THE FORMER EXISTENCE OF MYTH CREDIBLE TO HIMSELF BY MEANS OF SCHOLARSHIP, THROUGH INTERMEDIARY ABSTRACTIONS. BUT WITHOUT MYTH EVERY CULTURE LOSES THE HEALTHY NATURAL POWER OF ITS CREATIVITY: ONLY A HORIZON DEFINED BY MYTHS COMPLETES AND UNIFIES A WHOLE CULTURAL MOVEMENT. MYTH ALONE SAVES ALL THE POWERS OF THE IMAGINATION AND OF THE APOLLINIAN DREAM FROM THEIR AIMLESS WANDERINGS. THE IMAGES OF THE MYTH HAVE TO BE THE UNNOTICED OMNIPRESENT DEMONIC GUARDIANS, UNDER WHOSE CARE THE YOUNG SOUL GROWS TO MATURITY AND WHOSE SIGNS HELP THE MAN TO INTERPRET HIS LIFE AND STRUGGLES. EVEN THE STATE KNOWS NO MORE POWERFUL UNWRITTEN LAWS THAN THE MYTHICAL FOUNDATION THAT GUARANTEES ITS CONNECTION WITH RELIGION AND ITS GROWTH FROM MYTHICAL NOTIONS.

BY WAY OF COMPARISON LET US NOW PICTURE THE ABSTRACT MAN, UNTUTORED BY MYTH; ABSTRACT EDUCATION; ABSTRACT MORALITY; ABSTRACT LAW; THE ABSTRACT STATE; LET US IMAGINE THE LAWLESS ROVING OF THE ARTISTIC IMAGINATION, UNCHECKED BY ANY NATIVE MYTH; LET US THINK OF A CULTURE THAT HAS NO FIXED AND SACRED PRIMORDIAL SITE BUT IS DOOMED TO EXHAUST ALL POSSIBILITIES AND TO NOURISH ITSELF WRETCHEDLY ON ALL OTHER CULTURES‚ÄÎTHERE WE HAVE THE PRESENT AGE, THE RESULT OF THAT SOCRATISM WHICH IS BENT ON THE DESTRUCTION OF MYTH. AND NOW THE MYTHLESS MAN STANDS ETERNALLY HUNGRY, SURROUNDED BY ALL PAST AGES, AND DIGS AND GRUBS FOR ROOTS, EVEN IF HE HAS TO DIG FOR THEM AMONG THE REMOTEST ANTIQUITIES. THE TREMENDOUS HISTORICAL NEED OF OUR UNSATISFIED MODERN CULTURE, THE ASSEMBLING AROUND ONE OF COUNTLESS OTHER CULTURES, THE CONSUMING DESIRE FOR KNOWLEDGE‚ÄÎWHAT DOES ALL THIS POINT TO, IF NOT TO THE LOSS OF MYTH, THE LOSS OF THE MYTHICAL HOME, THE MYTHICAL MATERNAL WOMB? LET US ASK OURSELVES WHETHER THE FEVERISH AND UNCANNY EXCITEMENT OF THIS CULTURE IS ANYTHING BUT THE GREEDY SEIZING AND SNATCHING AT FOOD OF A HUNGRY MAN‚ÄÎAND WHO WOULD CARE TO CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING TO A CULTURE THAT CANNOT BE SATISFIED NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT DEVOURS, AND AT WHOSE CONTACT THE MOST VIGOROUS AND WHOLESOME NOURISHMENT IS CHANGED INTO ‚ÄÚHISTORY AND CRITICISM‚ÄÙ?

WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE TO REGARD OUR GERMAN CHARACTER WITH SORROWFUL DESPAIR, IF IT HAD ALREADY BECOME INEXTRICABLY ENTANGLED IN, OR EVEN IDENTICAL WITH, ITS CULTURE, AS WE MAY OBSERVE TO OUR HORROR IN THE CASE OF CIVILIZED FRANCE. WHAT FOR A LONG TIME WAS THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OF FRANCE AND THE CAUSE OF HER VAST SUPERIORITY, NAMELY, THIS VERY IDENTITY OF PEOPLE AND CULTURE, MIGHT COMPEL US IN VIEW OF THIS SIGHT TO CONGRATULATE OURSELVES THAT THIS SO QUESTIONABLE CULTURE OF OURS HAS AS YET NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE NOBLE CORE OF OUR PEOPLE‚ÄÔS CHARACTER.1 ON THE CONTRARY, ALL OUR HOPES STRETCH OUT LONGINGLY TOWARD THE PERCEPTION THAT BENEATH THIS RESTLESSLY PALPITATING CULTURAL LIFE AND CONVULSION THERE IS CONCEALED A GLORIOUS, INTRINSICALLY HEALTHY, PRIMORDIAL POWER THAT, TO BE SURE, STIRS VIGOROUSLY ONLY AT INTERVALS IN STUPENDOUS MOMENTS, AND THEN CONTINUES TO DREAM OF A FUTURE AWAKENING. IT IS FROM THIS ABYSS THAT THE GERMAN REFORMATION CAME FORTH; AND IN ITS CHORALES THE FUTURE TUNE OF GERMAN MUSIC RESOUNDED FOR THE FIRST TIME. SO DEEP, COURAGEOUS, AND SPIRITUAL, SO EXUBERANTLY GOOD AND TENDER DID THIS CHORALE OF LUTHER SOUND‚ÄÎAS THE FIRST DIONYSIAN LURING CALL BREAKING FORTH FROM DENSE THICKETS AT THE APPROACH OF SPRING. AND IN COMPETING ECHOES THE SOLEMNLY EXUBERANT PROCESSION OF DIONYSIAN REVELERS RESPONDED, TO WHOM WE ARE INDEBTED FOR GERMAN MUSIC‚ÄÎAND TO WHOM WE SHALL BE INDEBTED FOR THE REBIRTH OF GERMAN MYTH.

I KNOW THAT I MUST NOW LEAD THE SYMPATHIZING AND ATTENTIVE FRIEND TO AN ELEVATED POSITION OF LONELY CONTEMPLATION, WHERE HE WILL HAVE BUT FEW COMPANIONS, AND I CALL OUT ENCOURAGINGLY TO HIM THAT WE MUST HOLD FAST TO OUR LUMINOUS GUIDES, THE GREEKS. TO PURIFY OUR AESTHETIC INSIGHT, WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY BORROWED FROM THEM THE TWO DIVINE FIGURES WHO RULE OVER SEPARATE REALMS OF ART, AND CONCERNING WHOSE MUTUAL CONTACT AND ENHANCEMENT WE HAVE ACQUIRED SOME NOTION THROUGH GREEK TRAGEDY. IT HAD TO APPEAR TO US THAT THE DEMISE OF GREEK TRAGEDY WAS BROUGHT ABOUT THROUGH A REMARKABLE AND FORCIBLE DISSOCIATION OF THESE TWO PRIMORDIAL ARTISTIC DRIVES. TO THIS PROCESS THERE CORRESPONDED A DEGENERATION AND TRANSFORMATION OF THE CHARACTER OF THE GREEK PEOPLE, WHICH CALLS FOR SERIOUS REFLECTION ON HOW NECESSARY AND CLOSE THE FUNDAMENTAL CONNECTIONS ARE BETWEEN ART AND THE PEOPLE, MYTH AND CUSTOM, TRAGEDY AND THE STATE. THIS DEMISE OF TRAGEDY WAS AT THE SAME TIME THE DEMISE OF MYTH. UNTIL THEN THE GREEKS HAD FELT INVOLUNTARILY IMPELLED TO RELATE ALL THEIR EXPERIENCES IMMEDIATELY TO THEIR MYTHS, INDEED TO UNDERSTAND THEM ONLY IN THIS RELATION. THUS EVEN THE IMMEDIATE PRESENT HAD TO APPEAR TO THEM RIGHT AWAY SUB SPECIE AETERNI2 AND IN A CERTAIN SENSE AS TIMELESS.

BUT THE STATE NO LESS THAN ART DIPPED INTO THIS CURRENT OF THE TIMELESS TO FIND REST IN IT FROM THE BURDEN AND THE GREED OF THE MOMENT. AND ANY PEOPLE‚ÄÎJUST AS, INCIDENTALLY, ALSO ANY INDIVIDUAL‚ÄÎIS WORTH ONLY AS MUCH AS IT IS ABLE TO PRESS UPON ITS EXPERIENCES THE STAMP OF THE ETERNAL; FOR THUS IT IS, AS IT WERE, DESECULARIZED AND SHOWS ITS UNCONSCIOUS INWARD CONVICTIONS OF THE RELATIVITY OF TIME AND OF THE TRUE, THAT IS METAPHYSICAL, SIGNIFICANCE OF LIFE. THE OPPOSITE OF THIS HAPPENS WHEN A PEOPLE BEGINS TO COMPREHEND ITSELF HISTORICALLY AND TO SMASH THE MYTHICAL WORKS THAT SURROUND IT. AT THAT POINT WE GENERALLY FIND A DECISIVE SECULARIZATION, A BREAK WITH THE UNCONSCIOUS METAPHYSICS OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE, TOGETHER WITH ALL ITS ETHICAL CONSEQUENCES. GREEK ART AND PRE-EMINENTLY GREEK TRAGEDY DELAYED ABOVE ALL THE DESTRUCTION OF MYTH. ONE HAD TO DESTROY TRAGEDY, TOO, IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO LIVE AWAY FROM THE SOIL OF HOME, UNINHIBITED, IN THE WILDERNESS OF THOUGHT, CUSTOM, AND DEED. EVEN NOW THIS METAPHYSICAL DRIVE STILL TRIES TO CREATE FOR ITSELF A CERTAINLY ATTENUATED FORM OF TRANSFIGURATION, IN THE SOCRATISM OF SCIENCE THAT STRIVES FOR LIFE; BUT ON THE LOWER STEPS, THIS SAME DRIVE LED ONLY TO A FEVERISH SEARCH THAT GRADUALLY LOST ITSELF IN A PANDEMONIUM OF MYTHS AND SUPERSTITIONS THAT WERE COLLECTED FROM ALL OVER AND PILED UP IN CONFUSION: NEVERTHELESS THE GREEK SAT AMONG THEM WITH AN UNSTILLED HEART UNTIL HE LEARNED TO MASK THIS FEVER WITH GREEK CHEERFULNESS AND GREEK FRIVOLITY, BECOMING A GRAECULUS,3 OR HE NUMBED HIS MIND COMPLETELY IN SOME DARK ORIENTAL SUPERSTITION.

SINCE THE REAWAKENING OF ALEXANDRIAN-ROMAN ANTIQUITY IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY WE HAVE APPROXIMATED THIS STATE IN THE MOST EVIDENT MANNER, AFTER A LONG INTERLUDE THAT IS DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE. ON THE HEIGHTS WE ENCOUNTER THE SAME OVERABUNDANT LUST FOR KNOWLEDGE, THE SAME UNSATISFIED DELIGHT IN DISCOVERY, THE SAME TREMENDOUS SECULARIZATION, AND BESIDE IT A HOMELESS ROVING, A GREEDY CROWDING AROUND FOREIGN TABLES, A FRIVOLOUS DEIFICATION OF THE PRESENT, OR A DULLY DAZED RETREAT‚ÄÎEVERYTHING SUB SPECIE SAECULI,4 OF THE ‚ÄÚPRESENT AGE.‚ÄÙ AND THESE SAME SYMPTOMS ALLOW US TO INFER THE SAME LACK AT THE HEART OF THIS CULTURE, THE DESTRUCTION OF MYTH. IT SCARCELY SEEMS POSSIBLE TO BE CONTINUALLY SUCCESSFUL AT TRANSPLANTING A FOREIGN MYTH WITHOUT IRREPARABLY DAMAGING THE TREE BY THIS TRANSPLANTATION. IN ONE CASE IT MAY PERHAPS BE STRONG AND HEALTHY ENOUGH TO ELIMINATE THIS FOREIGN ELEMENT IN A TERRIBLE FIGHT; USUALLY, HOWEVER, IT MUST CONSUME ITSELF, SICK AND WITHERED OR IN DISEASED SUPERFOETATION.

WE THINK SO HIGHLY OF THE PURE AND VIGOROUS CORE OF THE GERMAN CHARACTER THAT WE DARE TO EXPECT OF IT ABOVE ALL OTHERS THIS ELIMINATION OF THE FORCIBLY IMPLANTED FOREIGN ELEMENTS, AND CONSIDER IT POSSIBLE THAT THE GERMAN SPIRIT WILL RETURN TO ITSELF. SOME MAY SUPPOSE THAT THIS SPIRIT MUST BEGIN ITS FIGHT WITH THE ELIMINATION OF EVERYTHING ROMANIC. IF SO THEY MAY RECOGNIZE AN EXTERNAL PREPARATION AND ENCOURAGEMENT IN THE VICTORIOUS FORTITUDE AND BLOODY GLORY OF THE LAST WAR; BUT ONE MUST STILL SEEK THE INNER NECESSITY IN THE AMBITION TO BE ALWAYS WORTHY OF THE SUBLIME CHAMPIONS ON THIS WAY, LUTHER AS WELL AS OUR GREAT ARTISTS AND POETS. BUT LET HIM NEVER BELIEVE THAT HE COULD FIGHT SIMILAR FIGHTS WITHOUT THE GODS OF HIS HOUSE, OR HIS MYTHICAL HOME, WITHOUT ‚ÄÚBRINGING BACK‚ÄÙ ALL GERMAN THINGS! AND IF THE GERMAN SHOULD HESITANTLY LOOK AROUND FOR A LEADER WHO MIGHT BRING HIM BACK AGAIN INTO HIS LONG LOST HOME WHOSE WAYS AND PATHS HE SCARCELY KNOWS ANYMORE, LET HIM MERELY LISTEN TO THE ECSTATICALLY LURING CALL OF THE DIONYSIAN BIRD THAT HOVERS ABOVE HIM AND WANTS TO POINT THE WAY FOR HIM.

AMONG THE PECULIAR ART EFFECTS OF MUSICAL TRAGEDY WE HAD TO EMPHASIZE AN APOLLINIAN ILLUSION BY MEANS OF WHICH WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SAVED FROM THE IMMEDIATE UNITY WITH DIONYSIAN MUSIC, WHILE OUR MUSICAL EXCITEMENT COULD DISCHARGE ITSELF IN AN APOLLINIAN FIELD AND IN RELATION TO A VISIBLE INTERMEDIARY WORLD THAT HAD BEEN INTERPOSED. AT THE SAME TIME WE THOUGHT THAT WE HAD OBSERVED HOW PRECISELY THROUGH THIS DISCHARGE THE INTERMEDIARY WORLD OF THE ACTION ON THE STAGE, AND THE DRAMA IN GENERAL, HAD BEEN MADE VISIBLE AND INTELLIGIBLE FROM THE INSIDE TO A DEGREE THAT IN ALL OTHER APOLLINIAN ART REMAINS UNATTAINED. WHERE THE APOLLINIAN RECEIVES WINGS FROM THE SPIRIT OF MUSIC AND SOARS, WE THUS FOUND THE HIGHEST INTENSIFICATION OF ITS POWERS, AND IN THIS FRATERNAL UNION OF APOLLO AND DIONYSUS WE HAD TO RECOGNIZE THE APEX OF THE APOLLINIAN AS WELL AS THE DIONYSIAN AIMS OF ART.

TO BE SURE, THE APOLLINIAN PROJECTION THAT IS THUS ILLUMINATED FROM INSIDE BY MUSIC DOES NOT ACHIEVE THE PECULIAR EFFECT OF THE WEAKER DEGREES OF APOLLINIAN ART. WHAT THE EPIC OR THE ANIMATED STONE CAN DO, COMPELLING THE CONTEMPLATIVE EYE TO FIND CALM DELIGHT IN THE WORLD OF INDIVIDUATION, THAT COULD NOT BE ATTAINED HERE, IN SPITE OF A HIGHER ANIMATION AND CLARITY. WE LOOKED AT THE DRAMA AND WITH PENETRATING EYE REACHED ITS INNER WORLD OF MOTIVES‚ÄÎAND YET WE FELT AS IF ONLY A PARABLE PASSED US BY, WHOSE MOST PROFOUND MEANING WE ALMOST THOUGHT WE COULD GUESS AND THAT WE WISHED TO DRAW AWAY LIKE A CURTAIN IN ORDER TO BEHOLD THE PRIMORDIAL IMAGE BEHIND IT. THE BRIGHTEST CLARITY OF THE IMAGE DID NOT SUFFICE US, FOR THIS SEEMED TO WISH JUST AS MUCH TO REVEAL SOMETHING AS TO CONCEAL SOMETHING. ITS REVELATION, BEING LIKE A PARABLE, SEEMED TO SUMMON US TO TEAR THE VEIL AND TO UNCOVER THE MYSTERIOUS BACKGROUND; BUT AT THE SAME TIME THIS ALL-ILLUMINATED TOTAL VISIBILITY CAST A SPELL OVER THE EYES AND PREVENTED THEM FROM PENETRATING DEEPER.

THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING TO SEE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY ALSO LONGED TO TRANSCEND ALL SEEING WILL SCARCELY BE ABLE TO IMAGINE HOW DEFINITELY AND CLEARLY THESE TWO PROCESSES COEXIST AND ARE FELT AT THE SAME TIME, AS ONE CONTEMPLATES THE TRAGIC MYTH. BUT ALL TRULY AESTHETIC SPECTATORS WILL CONFIRM THAT AMONG THE PECULIAR EFFECTS OF TRAGEDY THIS COEXISTENCE IS THE MOST REMARKABLE. NOW TRANSFER THIS PHENOMENON OF THE AESTHETIC SPECTATOR INTO AN ANALOGOUS PROCESS IN THE TRAGIC ARTIST, AND YOU WILL HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE GENESIS OF THE TRAGIC MYTH. WITH THE APOLLINIAN ART SPHERE HE SHARES THE COMPLETE PLEASURE IN MERE APPEARANCE AND IN SEEING, YET AT THE SAME TIME HE NEGATES THIS PLEASURE AND FINDS A STILL HIGHER SATISFACTION IN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE VISIBLE WORLD OF MERE APPEARANCE.

THE CONTENT OF THE TRAGIC MYTH IS, FIRST OF ALL, AN EPIC EVENT AND THE GLORIFICATION OF THE FIGHTING HERO. BUT WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THIS ENIGMATIC TRAIT THAT THE SUFFERING AND THE FATE OF THE HERO, THE MOST PAINFUL TRIUMPHS, THE MOST AGONIZING OPPOSITIONS OF MOTIVES, IN SHORT, THE EXEMPLIFICATION OF THIS WISDOM OF SILENUS, OR, TO PUT IT AESTHETICALLY, THAT WHICH IS UGLY AND DISHARMONIC, IS REPRESENTED EVER ANEW IN SUCH COUNTLESS FORMS AND WITH SUCH A DISTINCT PREFERENCE‚ÄÎAND PRECISELY IN THE MOST FRUITFUL AND YOUTHFUL PERIOD OF A PEOPLE? SURELY A HIGHER PLEASURE MUST BE PERCEIVED IN ALL THIS.

THAT LIFE IS REALLY SO TRAGIC WOULD LEAST OF ALL EXPLAIN THE ORIGIN OF AN ART FORM‚ÄÎASSUMING THAT ART IS NOT MERELY IMITATION OF THE REALITY OF NATURE BUT RATHER A METAPHYSICAL SUPPLEMENT OF THE REALITY OF NATURE, PLACED BESIDE IT FOR ITS OVERCOMING. THE TRAGIC MYTH, TOO, INSOFAR AS IT BELONGS TO ART AT ALL, PARTICIPATES FULLY IN THIS METAPHYSICAL INTENTION OF ART TO TRANSFIGURE. BUT WHAT DOES IT TRANSFIGURE WHEN IT PRESENTS THE WORLD OF APPEARANCE IN THE IMAGE OF THE SUFFERING HERO? LEAST OF ALL THE ‚ÄÚREALITY‚ÄÙ OF THIS WORLD OF APPEARANCE, FOR IT SAYS TO US: ‚ÄÚLOOK THERE! LOOK CLOSELY! THIS IS YOUR LIFE, THIS IS THE HAND ON THE CLOCK OF YOUR EXISTENCE.‚ÄÙ

AND THE MYTH SHOULD SHOW US THIS LIFE IN ORDER TO THUS TRANSFIGURE IT FOR US? BUT IF NOT, IN WHAT THEN LIES THE AESTHETIC PLEASURE WITH WHICH WE LET THESE IMAGES, TOO, PASS BEFORE US? I ASK ABOUT THE AESTHETIC PLEASURE, THOUGH I KNOW FULL WELL THAT MANY OF THESE IMAGES ALSO PRODUCE AT TIMES A MORAL DELIGHT, FOR EXAMPLE, UNDER THE FORM OF PITY OR MORAL TRIUMPH. BUT THOSE WHO WOULD DERIVE THE EFFECT OF THE TRAGIC SOLELY FROM THESE MORAL SOURCES‚ÄÎWHICH, TO BE SURE, HAS BEEN THE CUSTOM IN AESTHETICS ALL TOO LONG‚ÄÎSHOULD LEAST OF ALL BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE THUS ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING FOR ART, WHICH ABOVE ALL MUST DEMAND PURITY IN ITS SPHERE. IF YOU WOULD EXPLAIN THE TRAGIC MYTH, THE FIRST REQUIREMENT IS TO SEEK THE PLEASURE THAT IS PECULIAR TO IT IN THE PURELY AESTHETIC SPHERE, WITHOUT TRANSGRESSING INTO THE REGION OF PITY, FEAR, OR THE MORALLY SUBLIME. HOW CAN THE UGLY AND THE DISHARMONIC, THE CONTENT OF THE TRAGIC MYTH, STIMULATE AESTHETIC PLEASURE?

HERE IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO TAKE A BOLD RUNNING START AND LEAP INTO A METAPHYSICS OF ART, BY REPEATING THE SENTENCE WRITTEN ABOVE,1 THAT EXISTENCE AND THE WORLD SEEM JUSTIFIED ONLY AS AN AESTHETIC PHENOMENON. IN THIS SENSE, IT IS PRECISELY THE TRAGIC MYTH THAT HAS TO CONVINCE US THAT EVEN THE UGLY AND DISHARMONIC ARE PART OF AN ARTISTIC GAME THAT THE WILL IN THE ETERNAL AMPLITUDE OF ITS PLEASURE PLAYS WITH ITSELF. BUT THIS PRIMORDIAL PHENOMENON OF DIONYSIAN ART IS DIFFICULT TO GRASP, AND THERE IS ONLY ONE DIRECT WAY TO MAKE IT INTELLIGIBLE AND GRASP IT IMMEDIATELY: THROUGH THE WONDERFUL SIGNIFICANCE OF MUSICAL DISSONANCE. QUITE GENERALLY, ONLY MUSIC, PLACED BESIDE THE WORLD, CAN GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT IS MEANT BY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE WORLD AS AN AESTHETIC PHENOMENON. THE JOY AROUSED BY THE TRAGIC MYTH HAS THE SAME ORIGIN AS THE JOYOUS SENSATION OF DISSONANCE IN MUSIC. THE DIONYSIAN, WITH ITS PRIMORDIAL JOY EXPERIENCED EVEN IN PAIN, IS THE COMMON SOURCE OF MUSIC AND TRAGIC MYTH.

IS IT NOT POSSIBLE THAT BY CALLING TO OUR AID THE MUSICAL RELATION OF DISSONANCE WE MAY MEANWHILE HAVE MADE THE DIFFICULT PROBLEM OF THE TRAGIC EFFECT MUCH EASIER? FOR WE NOW UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO WISH TO SEE TRAGEDY AND AT THE SAME TIME TO LONG TO GET BEYOND ALL SEEING: REFERRING TO THE ARTISTICALLY EMPLOYED DISSONANCES, WE SHOULD HAVE TO CHARACTERIZE THE CORRESPONDING STATE BY SAYING THAT WE DESIRE TO HEAR AND AT THE SAME TIME LONG TO GET BEYOND ALL HEARING. THAT STRIVING FOR THE INFINITE, THE WING-BEAT OF LONGING THAT ACCOMPANIES THE HIGHEST DELIGHT IN CLEARLY PERCEIVED REALITY, REMINDS US THAT IN BOTH STATES WE MUST RECOGNIZE A DIONYSIAN PHENOMENON: AGAIN AND AGAIN IT REVEALS TO US THE PLAYFUL CONSTRUCTION AND DESTRUCTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL WORLD AS THE OVERFLOW OF A PRIMORDIAL DELIGHT. THUS THE DARK HERACLITUS COMPARES THE WORLD-BUILDING FORCE TO A PLAYING CHILD THAT PLACES STONES HERE AND THERE AND BUILDS SAND HILLS ONLY TO OVERTHROW THEM AGAIN.

IN ORDER, THEN, TO FORM A TRUE ESTIMATE OF THE DIONYSIAN CAPACITY OF A PEOPLE, WE MUST THINK NOT ONLY OF THEIR MUSIC, BUT ALSO JUST AS NECESSARILY OF THEIR TRAGIC MYTH, AS THE SECOND WITNESS OF THIS CAPACITY. CONSIDERING THIS EXTREMELY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MUSIC AND MYTH, ONE MUST SUPPOSE THAT A DEGENERATION AND DEPRAVATION OF THE ONE WILL INVOLVE A DETERIORATION OF THE OTHER, IF THE WEAKENING OF THE MYTH REALLY EXPRESSES A WEAKENING OF THE DIONYSIAN CAPACITY. CONCERNING BOTH, HOWEVER, A GLANCE AT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN CHARACTER SHOULD NOT LEAVE US IN ANY DOUBT. IN THE OPERA, JUST AS IN THE ABSTRACT CHARACTER OF OUR MYTHLESS EXISTENCE, IN AN ART DEGENERATED TO MERE ENTERTAINMENT AS WELL AS IN A LIFE GUIDED BY CONCEPTS, THE INARTISTIC AS WELL AS LIFE-CONSUMING NATURE OF SOCRATIC OPTIMISM HAD REVEALED ITSELF TO US. YET WE WERE COMFORTED BY INDICATIONS THAT NEVERTHELESS IN SOME INACCESSIBLE ABYSS THE GERMAN SPIRIT STILL RESTS AND DREAMS, UNDESTROYED, IN GLORIOUS HEALTH, PROFUNDITY, AND DIONYSIAN STRENGTH, LIKE A KNIGHT SUNK IN SLUMBER; AND FROM THIS ABYSS THE DIONYSIAN SONG RISES TO OUR EARS TO LET US KNOW THAT THIS GERMAN KNIGHT IS STILL DREAMING HIS PRIMORDIAL DIONYSIAN MYTH IN BLISSFULLY SERIOUS VISIONS. LET NO ONE BELIEVE THAT THE GERMAN SPIRIT HAS FOREVER LOST ITS MYTHICAL HOME WHEN IT CAN STILL UNDERSTAND SO PLAINLY THE VOICES OF THE BIRDS THAT TELL OF THAT HOME. SOME DAY IT WILL FIND ITSELF AWAKE IN ALL THE MORNING FRESHNESS FOLLOWING A TREMENDOUS SLEEP: THEN IT WILL SLAY DRAGONS, DESTROY VICIOUS DWARFS,2 WAKE BR√ºNNHILDE‚ÄÎAND EVEN WOTAN‚ÄÔS SPEAR WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STOP ITS COURSE!

MY FRIENDS, YOU WHO BELIEVE IN DIONYSIAN MUSIC, YOU ALSO KNOW WHAT TRAGEDY MEANS TO US. THERE WE HAVE TRAGIC MYTH REBORN FROM MUSIC‚ÄÎAND IN THIS MYTH WE CAN HOPE FOR EVERYTHING AND FORGET WHAT IS MOST PAINFUL. WHAT IS MOST PAINFUL FOR ALL OF US, HOWEVER EVER, IS‚ÄÎTHE PROLONGED DEGRADATION IN WHICH THE GERMAN GENIUS HAS LIVED, ESTRANGED FROM HOUSE AND HOME, IN THE SERVICE OF VICIOUS DWARFS. YOU UNDERSTAND MY WORDS‚ÄÎAS YOU WILL ALSO, IN CONCLUSION, UNDERSTAND MY HOPES.





25


MUSIC AND TRAGIC MYTH ARE EQUALLY EXPRESSIONS OF THE DIONYSIAN CAPACITY OF A PEOPLE, AND THEY ARE INSEPARABLE.1 BOTH DERIVE FROM A SPHERE OF ART THAT LIES BEYOND THE APOLLINIAN; BOTH TRANSFIGURE A REGION IN WHOSE JOYOUS CHORDS DISSONANCE AS WELL AS THE TERRIBLE IMAGE OF THE WORLD FADE AWAY CHARMINGLY; BOTH PLAY WITH THE STING OF DISPLEASURE, TRUSTING IN THEIR EXCEEDINGLY POWERFUL MAGIC ARTS; AND BY MEANS OF THIS PLAY BOTH JUSTIFY THE EXISTENCE OF EVEN THE ‚ÄÚWORST WORLD.‚ÄÙ THUS THE DIONYSIAN IS SEEN TO BE, COMPARED TO THE APOLLINIAN, THE ETERNAL AND ORIGINAL ARTISTIC POWER THAT FIRST CALLS THE WHOLE WORLD OF PHENOMENA INTO EXISTENCE‚ÄÎAND IT IS ONLY IN THE MIDST OF THIS WORLD THAT A NEW TRANSFIGURING ILLUSION2 BECOMES NECESSARY IN ORDER TO KEEP THE ANIMATED WORLD OF INDIVIDUATION ALIVE.

IF WE COULD IMAGINE DISSONANCE BECOME MAN‚ÄÎAND WHAT ELSE IS MAN?‚ÄÎTHIS DISSONANCE, TO BE ABLE TO LIVE, WOULD NEED A SPLENDID ILLUSION3 THAT WOULD COVER DISSONANCE WITH A VEIL OF BEAUTY. THIS IS THE TRUE ARTISTIC AIM OF APOLLO IN WHOSE NAME WE COMPREHEND ALL THOSE COUNTLESS ILLUSIONS OF THE BEAUTY OF MERE APPEARANCE4 THAT AT EVERY MOMENT MAKE LIFE WORTH LIVING AT ALL AND PROMPT THE DESIRE TO LIVE ON IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE THE NEXT MOMENT.

OF THIS FOUNDATION OF ALL EXISTENCE‚ÄÎTHE DIONYSIAN BASIC GROUND OF THE WORLD‚ÄÎNOT ONE WHIT MORE MAY ENTER THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE HUMAN INDIVIDUAL THAN CAN BE OVERCOME AGAIN BY THIS APOLLINIAN POWER OF TRANSFIGURATION. THUS THESE TWO ART DRIVES MUST UNFOLD THEIR POWERS IN A STRICT PROPORTION, ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF ETERNAL JUSTICE. WHERE THE DIONYSIAN POWERS RISE UP AS IMPETUOUSLY AS WE EXPERIENCE THEM NOW, APOLLO, TOO, MUST ALREADY HAVE DESCENDED AMONG US, WRAPPED IN A CLOUD; AND THE NEXT GENERATION WILL PROBABLY BEHOLD HIS MOST AMPLE BEAUTIFUL EFFECTS.

THAT THIS EFFECT SHOULD BE NECESSARY, EVERYBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TO FEEL MOST ASSUREDLY BY MEANS OF INTUITION, PROVIDED HE HAS EVER FELT, IF ONLY IN A DREAM, THAT HE WAS CARRIED BACK INTO AN ANCIENT GREEK EXISTENCE. WALKING UNDER LOFTY IONIC COLONNADES, LOOKING UP TOWARD A HORIZON THAT WAS CUT OFF BY PURE AND NOBLE LINES, FINDING REFLECTIONS OF HIS TRANSFIGURED SHAPE IN THE SHINING MARBLE AT HIS SIDE, AND ALL AROUND HIM SOLEMNLY STRIDING OR DELICATELY MOVING HUMAN BEINGS, SPEAKING WITH HARMONIOUS VOICES AND IN A RHYTHMIC LANGUAGE OF GESTURES‚ÄÎIN VIEW OF THIS CONTINUAL INFLUX OF BEAUTY, WOULD HE NOT HAVE TO EXCLAIM, RAISING HIS HAND TO APOLLO: ‚ÄÚBLESSED PEOPLE OF HELLAS! HOW GREAT MUST DIONYSUS BE AMONG YOU IF THE GOD OF DELOS CONSIDERS SUCH MAGIC NECESSARY TO HEAL YOUR DITHYRAMBIC MADNESS!‚ÄÙ

TO A MAN IN SUCH A MOOD, HOWEVER, AN OLD ATHENIAN, LOOKING UP AT HIM WITH THE SUBLIME EYES OF AESCHYLUS, MIGHT REPLY: ‚ÄÚBUT SAY THIS, TOO, CURIOUS STRANGER: HOW MUCH DID THIS PEOPLE HAVE TO SUFFER TO BE ABLE TO BECOME SO BEAUTIFUL! BUT NOW FOLLOW ME TO WITNESS A TRAGEDY, AND SACRIFICE WITH ME IN THE TEMPLE OF BOTH DEITIES!‚ÄÙ

ONE CAN BE AS HONEST AND FREE OF OPTIMISTIC ILLUSIONS AS SCHOPENHAUER WAS, AND STILL CELEBRATE LIFE AS FUNDAMENTALLY POWERFUL AND PLEASURABLE AS THE GREEKS DID.

4HAVING FINALLY BROKEN LOOSE FROM SCHOPENHAUER, NIETZSCHE FOR THE FIRST TIME SHOWS THE BRILLIANCY OF HIS OWN GENIUS.

ROUND MORE THAN HALF OF THE ORCHESTRA, FORMING A KIND OF HORSE-SHOE, WAS THE THEƑÅTRON (‚ÄÒSEEING-PLACE‚ÄÔ) PROPER, CIRCULAR TIERS OF SEATS, GENERALLY CUT OUT OF THE SIDE OF A HILL ‚Ä¶ BEHIND THE ORCHESTRA AND FACING THE AUDIENCE WAS THE SKƑÌNƑÌ [CALLED ‚ÄÚSCENE‚ÄÙ IN THE ABOVE TRANSLATION], ORIGINALLY A WOODEN STRUCTURE, A FA√ßADE WITH THREE DOORS, THROUGH WHICH, WHEN THE DRAMA HAD DEVELOPED FROM THE DITHYRAMBIC CHORUS, THE ACTORS MADE THEIR ENTRANCES‚ÄÙ (THE OXFORD COMPANION TO CLASSICAL LITERATURE, ED. SIR PAUL HARVEY, REVISED EDITION, 1946.).

THE CONTEXT UNEQUIVOCALLY REQUIRES OBLIVION OF THE WHOLE WORLD OF CULTURE: NOTHING IS BETWEEN THE BEHOLDER AND THE CHORUS. GOLFFING‚ÄÔS TRANSLATION IS ALTOGETHER MORE VIGOROUS THAN IT IS RELIABLE.

1THE CHIEF REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SO-CALLED OLD COMEDY WAS ARISTOPHANES (ABOUT 448-380 B.C.). ‚ÄÚTHE NEW COMEDY BEGAN TO PREVAIL ABOUT 336; ITS CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES ARE THE REPRESENTATION OF CONTEMPORARY LIFE BY MEANS OF IMAGINARY PERSONS DRAWN FROM IT, THE DEVELOPMENT OF PLOT AND CHARACTER, THE SUBSTITUTION OF HUMOUR FOR WIT, AND THE INTRODUCTION OF ROMANTIC LOVE AS A THEME. IT RESEMBLES THE TRAGEDY OF EURIPIDES (THE ‚ÄÒION‚ÄÔ FOR EXAMPLE) MORE THAN THE COMEDY OF ARISTOPHANES. OF THE CHORUS NO MORE REMAINS THAN A BAND OF MUSICIANS AND DANCERS WHOSE PERFORMANCES PUNCTUATE INTERVALS IN THE PLAY. THE NEW COMEDY IS IN FACT AN OBVIOUS PROGENITOR OF THE MODERN DRAMA. BUT THE MORAL STANDARD IS SURPRISINGLY LOW‚Ä¶.‚ÄÙ (THE OXFORD COMPANION TO CLASSICAL LITERATURE, ED. CIT.).

2ARISTOTLE HAD CALLED EURIPIDES ‚ÄÚTHE MOST TRAGIC OF THE POETS‚ÄÙ (POETICS 1453A). ALTHOUGH NIETZSCHE HAS MORE FEELING FOR POETRY‚ÄÎAND TRAGEDY‚ÄÎTHAN ARISTOTLE DID, THIS ESTIMATE SEEMS FAIRER THAN NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CONCEPTION OF EURIPIDES AS THE MOST OPTIMISTIC. SURELY, EURIPIDES DID NOT BELIEVE THAT ‚ÄÚHE WHO IS VIRTUOUS IS HAPPY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎON THE CONTRARY‚ÄÎAND THE SUPERABUNDANCE OF DIALECTICAL FIREWORKS IN HIS TRAGEDIES, THOUGH IT DOES DISSIPATE THE TRAGIC EMOTION, USUALLY ILLUSTRATES THE FUTILITY OF REASON, ITS INABILITY TO PREVENT TRAGEDY.

1LYNCEUS, ONE OF THE ARGONAUTS, WAS SO SHARP-SIGHTED HE COULD SEE THROUGH THE EARTH AND DISTINGUISH OBJECTS ALMOST TEN MILES AWAY. ALTHOUGH THE GERMAN WORD FOR ‚ÄÚLYNX‚ÄÙ IS LUCHS AND NIETZSCHE WRITES LYNKEUSAUGEN, PREVIOUS TRANSLATIONS SAY ‚ÄÚLYNX EYES.‚ÄÙ

2PREVIOUS TRANSLATIONS HAVE MISSED NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS POINT. THE BEST COMMENTARY ON HIS CONTRAST IS FOUND IN SECTION 4 OF THE PREFACE TO THE GAY SCIENCE, REPRINTED AT THE END OF NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER (PORTABLE NIETZSCHE). IN THIS BEAUTIFUL PASSAGE NIETZSCHE TAKES ISSUE WITH THOSE WHO ‚ÄÚWANT BY ALL MEANS TO UNVEIL, UNCOVER ‚Ä¶ WE NO LONGER BELIEVE THAT TRUTH REMAINS TRUTH WHEN THE VEILS ARE WITHDRAWN.‚ÄÙ WE HAVE LEARNED ‚ÄÚTO STOP COURAGEOUSLY AT THE SURFACE, THE FOLD, THE SKIN, TO ADORE APPEARANCE, TO BELIEVE IN FORMS, TONES, WORDS, IN THE WHOLE OLYMPUS OF APPEARANCE. THOSE GREEKS WERE SUPERFICIAL‚ÄÎOUT OF PROFUNDITY‚Ä¶. ARE WE NOT, PRECISELY IN THIS RESPECT, GREEKS? ADORERS OF FORMS, OF TONES, OF WORDS? AND THEREFORE‚ÄÎARTISTS?‚ÄÙ

3‚ÄÚNOT THE TRUTH IN WHOSE POSSESSION ANY MAN IS, OR THINKS HE IS, BUT THE HONEST EFFORT HE HAS MADE TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH, IS WHAT CONSTITUTES THE WORTH OF A MAN. FOR IT IS NOT THROUGH THE POSSESSION BUT THROUGH THE INQUIRY AFTER TRUTH THAT HIS POWERS EXPAND, AND IN THIS ALONE CONSISTS HIS EVER GROWING PERFECTION. POSSESSION MAKES CALM, LAZY, PROUD‚ÄÎ

‚ÄÚIF GOD HAD LOCKED UP ALL TRUTH IN HIS RIGHT HAND, AND IN HIS LEFT THE UNIQUE, EVER-LIVE STRIVING FOR TRUTH, ALBEIT WITH THE ADDITION THAT I SHOULD ALWAYS AND ETERNALLY ERR, AND HE SAID TO ME, ‚ÄÒCHOOSE!‚ÄÔ‚ÄÎI SHOULD HUMBLY CLASP HIS LEFT HAND, SAYING: ‚ÄÒFATHER, GIVE! PURE TRUTH IS AFTER ALL FOR THEE ALONE!‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

THIS CELEBRATED PASSAGE IS FOUND AT THE END OF THE FIRST SECTION OF EINE DUPLIK (A REPLY OF THE ACCUSED TO THE REJOINDER OF HIS ACCUSER), 1778. KIERKEGAARD ALSO ADMIRED THIS PASSAGE WITHOUT FEELING THAT HE COULD FOLLOW LESSING‚ÄÔS EXAMPLE: SEE CONCLUDING UNSCIENTIFIC POSTSCRIPT, THE FINAL SECTION OF BOOK TWO, PART ONE, AND, FOR SOME CRITICAL DISCUSSION, KAUFMANN, FROM SHAKESPEARE TO EXISTENTIALISM, REV. ED. (NEW YORK, ANCHOR BOOKS, 1960).). NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS TREATMENT OF LESSING IN HIS SECOND BOOK, THE ‚ÄÚMEDITATION‚ÄÙ ON DAVID FRIEDRICH STRAUSS, THE CONFESSOR AND WRITER (1873), IS DISCUSSED AT LENGTH IN KAUFMANN, NIETZSCHE, CHAPTER 4, SECTION 2.

HANS JOACHIM METTE (MUNICH, BECK, 1933). THE DISCUSSION OF THE BIRTH AND DEATH OF TRAGEDY IS FINISHED IN THE MAIN, AND THE FOLLOWING CELEBRATION OF THE REBIRTH OF TRAGEDY WEAKENS THE BOOK AND WAS SHORTLY REGRETTED BY NIETZSCHE HIMSELF.

2NIETZSCHE CLEARLY DID NOT MEAN TO IMPLY THAT ALL MUSIC IS ‚ÄÚDIONYSIAN.‚ÄÙ YET IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM AT THIS TIME TO CONSIDER MOZART‚ÄÔS MUSIC AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO WAGNER‚ÄÔS. MOZART IS NOT MENTIONED IN THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY. HE IS MENTIONED ELSEWHERE BY THE YOUNG NIETZSCHE, AND ALL REFERENCES EXPRESS LOVE AND ADMIRATION. BUT IT WAS ONLY IN 1880, IN THE WANDERER AND HIS SHADOW (SECTION 165), AFTER HIS BREAK WITH WAGNER, THAT NIETZSCHE OFFERED A CONTRAST OF WAGNER AND MOZART IN ONE OF HIS BOOKS‚ÄÎWITHOUT MENTIONING WAGNER BY NAME. EVENTUALLY, HE INCLUDED THIS PASSAGE AND SOME COMPARABLE ONES FROM BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL (1886) IN NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER. WHEN IT OCCURRED TO NIETZSCHE THAT MOZART‚ÄÔS MUSIC WAS NOT DIONYSIAN, HE ALSO REALIZED THAT WAGNER‚ÄÔS MUSIC WAS NOT REALLY ‚ÄÚDIONYSIAN‚ÄÙ EITHER, BUT RATHER ‚ÄÚROMANTIC‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚDECADENT.‚ÄÙ SEE NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER (IN THE PORTABLE NIETZSCHE, ESPECIALLY.) AND SECTION 370 OF THE GAY SCIENCE (IN KAUFMANN, NIETZSCHE, CHAPTER 12, SECTION V).

3ENTARTETE KUNST; THE TERM WAS MADE INFAMOUS BY THE NAZIS WHEN THEY SUBSUMED UNDER IT A GREAT DEAL OF MODERN ART WHICH WAS OFFICIALLY PROSCRIBED. BUT THE NAZIS WANTED ‚ÄÚBEAUTIFUL FORMS‚ÄÙ AND RAGED AGAINST ART WHICH DID NOT AIM AT ‚ÄÚBEAUTY,‚ÄÙ WHILE NIETZSCHE CRITICIZES THE ASSUMPTION THAT ALL ART MUST AIM AT ‚ÄÚBEAUTIFUL FORMS.‚ÄÙ

1ALL EDITIONS PUBLISHED BY NIETZSCHE HIMSELF CONTAIN THESE WORDS, AND WILAMOWITZ CITED THIS PASSAGE BOTH IN 1872 (P. 6) AND IN 1873 (P. 6). THE STANDARD EDITIONS OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS COLLECTED WORKS SUBSTITUTE ‚ÄÚAN INDIAN (BRAHMANIC) CULTURE‚ÄÙ FOR ‚ÄÚBUDDHISTIC CULTURE.‚ÄÙ ACCORDING TO VOLUME I (P. 599) OF THE SO-CALLED GROSSOKTAV EDITION OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS WERKE (1905), THIS CHANGE IS BASED ON ‚ÄÚA PENCILED CORRECTION IN NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS OWN HAND IN HIS COPY OF THE SECOND VERSION.‚ÄÙ IT WOULD SEEM THAT BOTH ‚ÄÚBUDDHISTIC‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚBRAHMANIC‚ÄÙ DEPEND ON SOME MISCONCEPTION; NEITHER SEEMS TO MAKE MUCH SENSE.

2IT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO DISTINGUISH THE ALEXANDRIAN PERIOD OF GREEK LITERATURE FROM THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING ATTIC PERIOD. THE GREAT TRAGIC POETS, AS WELL AS THUCYDIDES, PLATO, AND ARISTOTLE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ATHENS AND BELONG TO THE IMMENSELY CREATIVE FIFTH AND FOURTH CENTURIES, ALONG WITH PHIDIAS AND PRAXITELES. THE GLORIES OF ALEXANDRIA, THE INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL OF THE HELLENIC WORLD FROM ABOUT 300 TO 30 B.C., INCLUDE NO REMOTELY COMPARABLE CREATIVE ACHIEVEMENTS BUT ARE ITS IMMENSE LIBRARY, WHICH FAR SURPASSED ANY PREVIOUS COLLECTION, AND ITS OFTEN EXCEEDINGLY ERUDITE SCHOLARS. TO BE SURE, ONE STILL WROTE POETRY AND VAST AMOUNTS OF PROSE, BUT ON THE WHOLE THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE SCIENTISTS AND SCHOLARS WERE MORE REMARKABLE. NIETZSCHE IS PLAINLY SUGGESTING THAT NINETEENTH-CENTURY GERMANY IS IN IMPORTANT RESPECTS STRIKINGLY SIMILAR TO ALEXANDRIAN CIVILIZATION.

3OTTO JAHN WAS BORN IN 1813, LIKE NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS FATHER, RICHARD WAGNER, AND KIERKEGAARD, AND DIED IN 1869. HE WAS A PROFESSOR OF CLASSICAL PHILOLOGY AT BONN, FIRST A FRIEND AND LATER A FOE OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS TEACHER RITSCHL. HIS MANY PUBLICATIONS INCLUDED ARTICLES ON GREEK TRAGEDIES AND ON ANCIENT SCULPTURES AND VASE PAINTINGS, A LIFE OF MOZART, AND ESSAYS ON MUSIC. TO EXPLAIN THE ABOVE REMARK, IT MAY BE RELEVANT TO RECALL A PASSAGE IN ONE OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS LETTERS TO ROHDE, OCTOBER 8, 1868: ‚ÄÚRECENTLY I HAVE ALSO READ ‚Ä¶ JAHN‚ÄÔS ESSAYS ON MUSIC, INCLUDING THOSE ON WAGNER. IT REQUIRES SOME ENTHUSIASM TO DO JUSTICE TO SUCH A MAN, WHILE JAHN HAS AN INSTINCTIVE AVERSION AND LISTENS ONLY WITH EARS THAT ARE HALF PLUGGED. NEVERTHELESS I AGREE WITH HIM ON MANY POINTS; ESPECIALLY INSOFAR AS HE CONSIDERS WAGNER THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A MODERN DILETTANTISM THAT ABSORBS AND DIGESTS ALL ARTISTIC INTERESTS. BUT PRECISELY FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW ONE CAN HARDLY BE ASTONISHED ENOUGH AT HOW IMPOSING EVERY SINGLE ARTISTIC TALENT IS IN THIS MAN, AND WHAT INEXHAUSTIBLE ENERGY IS HERE COUPLED WITH SUCH MANY-SIDED ARTISTIC TALENTS, WHILE ‚ÄÒEDUCATION,‚ÄÔ THE MORE MOTLEY AND COMPREHENSIVE IT IS, USUALLY APPEARS WITH WEAK EYES, FEEBLE LEGS, AND UNNERVED LOINS. MOREOVER, WAGNER HAS A DIMENSION OF FEELINGS THAT REMAINS ALTOGETHER HIDDEN FROM O. JAHN: JAHN SIMPLY REMAINS A ‚Ä¶ HEALTHY MAN FOR WHOM THE MYTH OF TANNH√§USER AND THE ATMOSPHERE OF LOHENGRIN REMAIN A CLOSED WORLD. WHAT I LIKE ABOUT WAGNER IS WHAT I LIKE ABOUT SCHOPENHAUER: THE ETHICAL AIR, THE FAUSTIAN FRAGRANCE, CROSS, DEATH, AND TOMB, ETC.‚ÄÙ

1THIS REQUEST THAT NO ONE SHOULD TROUBLE OUR FAITH BECAUSE IT ALONE GIVES US HOPE, CONTRASTS VERY SHARPLY WITH NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS LATER ATTITUDE TOWARD FAITH.

THE MEDIUM DISTANCE THAT THEY FINALLY DISCOVER AND THAT MAKES ASSOCIATION POSSIBLE IS POLITENESS AND GOOD MANNERS. WHOEVER DOES NOT KEEP THIS DISTANCE IS TOLD, AMONG THE BRITISH: KEEP YOUR DISTANCE!‚ÄÎTO BE SURE, THIS ONLY PERMITS IMPERFECT SATISFACTION OF THE NEED FOR MUTUAL WARMTH, BUT IT ALSO KEEPS ONE FROM FEELING THE PRICK OF THE QUILLS.‚ÄÎBUT WHOEVER POSSESSES MUCH INNER WARMTH OF HIS OWN WILL PREFER TO AVOID COMPANY LEST HE CAUSE OR SUFFER ANNOYANCE.‚ÄÙ I HAVE QUOTED THIS PARABLE IN ITS ENTIRETY; KEEP YOUR DISTANCE IS ENGLISH IN THE ORIGINAL.

DUAL PREHISTORY OF GOOD AND EVIL.‚ÄÎTHE CONCEPT OF GOOD AND EVIL HAS A DUAL PREHISTORY; FIRST, IN THE SOUL OF THE RULING TRIBES AND CASTES. WHOEVER HAS THE POWER TO REPAY GOOD WITH GOOD, EVIL WITH EVIL, AND ALSO ACTUALLY REPAYS, THUS BEING GRATEFUL AND VENGEFUL, IS CALLED GOOD; WHOEVER IS POWERLESS AND UNABLE TO REPAY IS CONSIDERED BAD. AS ONE WHO IS GOOD, ONE BELONGS TO THE ‚ÄÚGOOD,‚ÄÙ A COMMUNITY THAT POSSESSES COMMUNAL FEELING BECAUSE ALL INDIVIDUALS ARE KNIT TOGETHER BY THE SENSE OF REPAYMENT. AS ONE WHO IS BAD, ONE BELONGS TO THE ‚ÄÚBAD,‚ÄÙ A GROUP OF SUBJECTED, IMPOTENT HUMAN BEINGS WHO HAVE NO COMMUNAL FEELING. THE GOOD ARE A CASTE, THE BAD A MASS LIKE DUST. GOOD AND BAD ARE FOR A TIME THE SAME AS NOBLE AND LOW, MASTER AND SLAVE. BUT THE ENEMY IS NOT CONSIDERED EVIL, HE CAN REPAY. TROJAN AND GREEK ARE BOTH GOOD IN HOMER. NOT HE THAT DOES US HARM BUT HE THAT IS CONTEMPTIBLE IS CONSIDERED BAD. IN THE COMMUNITY OF THE GOOD, GOOD IS INHERITED; IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT A BAD PERSON SHOULD GROW OUT OF SUCH GOOD SOIL. IF ONE OF THE GOOD NEVERTHELESS DOES SOMETHING UNWORTHY OF THE GOOD, THEN ONE HAS RECOURSE TO EXCUSES; ONE BLAMES A GOD, FOR EXAMPLE, SAYING THAT HE STRUCK THE GOOD MAN WITH DELUSION AND MADNESS.

THEN, IN THE SOUL OF THE OPPRESSED, THE POWERLESS. HERE ALL OTHER HUMAN BEINGS ARE CONSIDERED HOSTILE, RUTHLESS, EXPLOITING, CRUEL, CUNNING, WHETHER THEY BE NOBLE OR LOW. EVIL IS THE CHARACTERISTIC WORD FOR MAN, INDEED FOR EVERY LIVING BEING BELIEVED IN, FOR EXAMPLE FOR A GOD; HUMAN OR DIVINE MEANS AS MUCH AS DEVILISH OR EVIL. THE SIGNS OF GRACIOUSNESS, HELPFULNESS, PITY ARE TAKEN ANXIOUSLY AS WILES, AS PRELUDES TO A DISASTROUS CONCLUSION, SOPORIFICS AND CRAFT, IN SHORT, AS REFINED MALICE. AS LONG AS INDIVIDUALS HAVE SUCH AN ATTITUDE, A COMMUNITY CAN HARDLY COME INTO BEING; AT BEST, ONLY ITS RUDIMENTS: HENCE, WHEREVER THIS CONCEPTION OF GOOD AND EVIL RULES, THE RUINATION OF INDIVIDUALS, THEIR TRIBES AND RACES, IS NEAR.

OUR CURRENT MORALITY HAS GROWN ON THE SOIL OF THE RULING TRIBES AND CASTES.1

ORIGIN OF JUSTICE.‚ÄÎJUSTICE (FAIRNESS)2 ORIGINATES AMONG THOSE WHO ARE APPROXIMATELY EQUALLY POWERFUL, AS THUCYDIDES (IN THE TERRIBLE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE ATHENIAN AND MELIAN AMBASSADORS) COMPREHENDED CORRECTLY: WHERE THERE IS NO CLEARLY RECOGNIZABLE PREDOMINANCE AND A FIGHT WOULD MEAN INCONCLUSIVE MUTUAL DAMAGE, THERE THE IDEA ORIGINATES THAT ONE MIGHT COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING AND NEGOTIATE ONE‚ÄÔS CLAIMS: THE INITIAL CHARACTER OF JUSTICE IS THE CHARACTER OF A TRADE. EACH SATISFIES THE OTHER INASMUCH AS EACH RECEIVES WHAT HE ESTEEMS MORE THAN THE OTHER DOES. ONE GIVES ANOTHER WHAT HE WANTS, SO THAT IT BECOMES HIS, AND IN RETURN ONE RECEIVES WHAT ONE WANTS. THUS JUSTICE IS REPAYMENT AND EXCHANGE ON THE ASSUMPTION OF AN APPROXIMATELY EQUAL POWER POSITION; REVENGE ORIGINALLY BELONGS IN THE DOMAIN OF JUSTICE, BEING AN EXCHANGE. GRATITUDE, TOO.

JUSTICE NATURALLY DERIVES FROM PRUDENT CONCERN WITH SELF-PRESERVATION; THAT MEANS, FROM THE EGOISM OF THE CONSIDERATION: ‚ÄÚWHY SHOULD I HARM MYSELF USELESSLY AND PERHAPS NOT ATTAIN MY GOAL ANYWAY?‚ÄÙ

SO MUCH ON THE ORIGIN OF JUSTICE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR INTELLECTUAL HABITS, MEN HAVE FORGOTTEN THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF SO-CALLED JUST, FAIR ACTIONS, AND FOR MILLENNIA CHILDREN HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO ADMIRE AND EMULATE SUCH ACTIONS. HENCE IT HAS GRADUALLY COME TO APPEAR AS IF A JUST ACTION WERE UNEGOISTIC; BUT THE HIGH ESTEEM FOR IT DEPENDS ON THIS APPEARANCE, AND THIS ESTEEM, MOREOVER, CONTINUES TO GROW ALL THE TIME, LIKE ALL ESTEEM; FOR WHATEVER IS HIGHLY ESTEEMED BECOMES THE OBJECT OF STRIVING, EMULATION, AND MULTIPLICATION, COUPLED WITH MANY SACRIFICES, AND GROWS FURTHER BECAUSE THE VALUE OF THE EFFORT AND ZEAL IS ADDED BY EVERY INDIVIDUAL TO THE VALUE OF THE THING HE ESTEEMS.

HOW LITTLE THE WORLD WOULD LOOK MORAL WITHOUT FORGETFULNESS! A POET MIGHT SAY THAT GOD MADE FORGETFULNESS THE GUARD HE PLACED AT THE THRESHOLD OF HUMAN DIGNITY.

MORES AND MORAL?3‚ÄÎBEING MORAL OR ETHICAL MEANS OBEYING ANCIENT ESTABLISHED LAW OR CUSTOM. WHETHER ONE SUBMITS TO IT WITH DIFFICULTY OR GLADLY, THAT IS IMMATERIAL; IT IS ENOUGH THAT ONE DOES IT. ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ IS WHAT ONE CALLS THOSE WHO DO WHAT IS MORAL AS IF THEY DID IT BY NATURE, AFTER LONG HEREDITY‚ÄÎIN OTHER WORDS, EASILY AND GLADLY‚ÄÎWHATEVER MAY BE MORAL IN THIS SENSE (PRACTICING REVENGE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN PRACTICING REVENGE BELONGS, AS IT DID AMONG THE MORE ANCIENT GREEKS, TO GOOD MORES). HE IS CALLED GOOD BECAUSE HE IS GOOD ‚ÄÚFOR SOMETHING;‚ÄÙ BUT BECAUSE BENEVOLENCE, PITY, AND THAT SORT OF THING HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FELT TO BE, THROUGH MANY CHANGES IN MORES, ‚ÄÚGOOD FOR SOMETHING‚ÄÙ AND USEFUL, IT HAS COME TO PASS THAT NOW THE BENEVOLENT AND HELPFUL ARE PRE-EMINENTLY CONSIDERED ‚ÄÚGOOD.‚ÄÙ

BEING EVIL IS BEING ‚ÄÚNOT MORAL‚ÄÙ (IMMORAL), PRACTICING IMMORALITY, RESISTING TRADITION, HOWEVER REASONABLE OR STUPID TRADITION MAY BE. HARMING THE NEIGHBOR, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN FELT TO BE PREEMINENTLY HARMFUL IN ALL THE MORAL LAWS OF DIFFERENT AGES, UNTIL NOW THE WORD ‚ÄÚEVIL‚ÄÙ IS ASSOCIATED PRIMARILY WITH THE DELIBERATE HARMING OF THE NEIGHBOR.

NOT ‚ÄÚEGOISTIC‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚUNEGOISTIC‚ÄÙ IS THE FUNDAMENTAL PAIR OF CONTRARIES THAT HAS LED MEN TO DISTINGUISH MORAL AND IMMORAL, GOOD AND EVIL, BUT RATHER: BEING TIED TO A TRADITION AND LAW, AND DETACHMENT FROM THEM. HOW THE TRADITION ORIGINATED IS INDIFFERENT; IN ANY CASE IT WAS WITHOUT ANY REGARD FOR GOOD AND EVIL OR ANY IMMANENT CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE, BUT ABOVE ALL IN ORDER TO PRESERVE A COMMUNITY, A PEOPLE: EVERY SUPERSTITIOUS CUSTOM THAT ORIGINATED ON THE BASIS OF SOME MISINTERPRETED ACCIDENT INVOLVES A TRADITION THAT IT IS MORAL TO FOLLOW; FOR DETACHING ONESELF FROM IT IS DANGEROUS, EVEN MORE DANGEROUS FOR THE COMMUNITY THAN FOR THE INDIVIDUAL (BECAUSE THE DEITY PUNISHES THE COMMUNITY‚ÄÎAND THE INDIVIDUAL ONLY INDIRECTLY‚ÄÎFOR THE SACRILEGE AND THE VIOLATION OF DIVINE PRIVILEGES). NOW EVERY TRADITION BECOMES EVER MORE VENERABLE THE MORE REMOTE ITS ORIGINS ARE AND THE MORE THEY HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN; THE VENERATION SHOWN IT IS ACCUMULATED, GENERATION UPON GENERATION; FINALLY, THE TRADITION BECOMES HOLY AND INSPIRES REVERENCE; AND THUS THE MORALITY OF PIOUS REGARD FOR THE OLD4 IS CERTAINLY A MUCH MORE ANCIENT MORALITY THAN THAT WHICH DEMANDS UNEGOISTIC ACTIONS.

ON CHRISTIAN ASCETICISM AND HOLINESS.‚ÄÎSTRONGLY AS INDIVIDUAL THINKERS HAVE ENDEAVORED TO PRESENT THE RARE PHENOMENA OF MORALITY THAT ARE USUALLY CALLED ASCETICISM AND HOLINESS AS IF THEY WERE MARVELS THAT IT WOULD ALMOST BE SACRILEGE AND DESECRATION TO ILLUMINATE BY RAISING THE TORCH OF RATIONAL EXPLANATION UP TO THEIR FACE‚ÄÎTHE TEMPTATION TO COMMIT THIS SACRILEGE IS JUST AS STRONG. A POWERFUL IMPULSE OF NATURE HAS LED MEN IN ALL AGES TO PROTEST AGAINST THESE PHENOMENA AS SUCH; SCIENCE, INSOFAR AS IT IS, AS MENTIONED, AN IMITATION OF NATURE, AT LEAST TAKES THE LIBERTY TO OBJECT TO THEIR ALLEGED INEXPLICABILITY AND EVEN UNAPPROACHABILITY. TO BE SURE, SO FAR IT HAS NOT SUCCEEDED: THESE PHENOMENA ARE STILL UNEXPLAINED, MUCH TO THE DELIGHT OF THE SAID ADMIRERS OF MORAL MARVELS. FOR, TO SPEAK GENERALLY: THE UNEXPLAINED SHOULD BY ALL MEANS BE UNEXPLAINABLE, THE UNEXPLAINABLE BY ALL MEANS UNNATURAL, SUPERNATURAL, MIRACULOUS‚ÄÎTHUS GOES THE DEMAND IN THE SOULS OF ALL THE RELIGIOUS AND METAPHYSICIANS (OF ARTISTS, TOO, IF THEY ARE AT THE SAME TIME THINKERS); WHILE THE SCIENTIFIC PERSON SEES IN THIS DEMAND THE ‚ÄÚEVIL PRINCIPLE.‚ÄÙ

THE GENERAL FIRST PROBABILITY ONE ENCOUNTERS AS ONE CONTEMPLATES HOLINESS AND ASCETICISM IS THIS: THEIR NATURE IS COMPLICATED; FOR ALMOST EVERYWHERE, IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD AS WELL AS IN THE MORAL WORLD, ONE HAS SUCCEEDED IN REDUCING THE ALLEGEDLY MIRACULOUS TO THE COMPLICATED WHICH DEPENDS ON MANY CONDITIONS. LET US DARE THEN TO BEGIN BY ISOLATING SINGLE IMPULSES IN THE SOULS OF HOLY MEN AND ASCETICS, AND TO CONCLUDE BY THINKING OF THEM AS GROWN TOGETHER.

THERE IS A DEFIANCE OF ONESELF AMONG WHOSE MOST SUBLIMATED EXPRESSIONS SOME FORMS OF ASCETICISM BELONG. FOR CERTAIN HUMAN BEINGS HAVE SUCH A GREAT NEED TO EXERCISE THEIR FORCE AND LUST TO RULE THAT, LACKING OTHER OBJECTS, OR BECAUSE THEY HAVE ALWAYS FAILED ELSEWHERE, THEY FINALLY HAVE RECOURSE TO TYRANNIZING CERTAIN PARTS OF THEIR OWN NATURE, AS IT WERE SECTIONS OR STAGES OF THEMSELVES.

THUS SOME THINKERS PROFESS VIEWS THAT EVIDENTLY DO NOT SERVE TO INCREASE OR IMPROVE THEIR REPUTATIONS; SOME PRACTICALLY CONJURE UP THE DISRESPECT OF OTHERS FOR THEM, ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE EASY FOR THEM TO REMAIN HIGHLY RESPECTED, SIMPLY BY KEEPING STILL. OTHERS RECANT FORMER OPINIONS AND ARE NOT AFRAID OF HENCEFORTH BEING CALLED INCONSISTENT: ON THE CONTRARY, THEY EXERT THEMSELVES TO THAT END AND BEHAVE LIKE EXUBERANT RIDERS WHO LIKE THEIR HORSE BEST WHEN IT HAS GONE WILD, IS COVERED WITH SWEAT, AND SHYING.

THUS MAN ASCENDS THE HIGHEST MOUNTAINS ON DANGEROUS PATHS, TO LAUGH SCORNFULLY AT HIS ANXIETY AND HIS TREMBLING KNEES; THUS THE PHILOSOPHER PROFESSES VIEWS OF ASCETICISM, HUMILITY, AND SANCTITY IN WHOSE SPLENDOR HIS OWN IMAGE IS MADE EXCEEDINGLY UGLY. THIS BREAKING OF ONESELF, THIS MOCKERY OF ONE‚ÄÔS OWN NATURE, THIS SPERNERE SE SPERNI5 OF WHICH RELIGIONS HAVE MADE SO MUCH, IS REALLY A VERY HIGH DEGREE OF VANITY. THE WHOLE MORALITY OF THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT BELONGS HERE: MAN EXPERIENCES A VERITABLE VOLUPTUOUSNESS IN VIOLATING HIMSELF BY MEANS OF EXAGGERATED DEMANDS AND IN THEN DEIFYING THIS TYRANNICALLY DEMANDING FORCE IN HIS SOUL.

IN EVERY ASCETIC MORALITY MAN ADORES PART OF HIMSELF AS GOD AND TO THAT END NEEDS TO DIABOLICIZE THE REST.





142


TO SUM UP WHAT HAS BEEN SAID HERE: THAT STATE OF THE SOUL WHICH THE HOLY MAN OR THE MAN WHO IS BECOMING HOLY ENJOYS IS COMPOSED OF ELEMENTS WHICH ALL OF US KNOW QUITE WELL; THEY MERELY TAKE ON A DIFFERENT COLORING WHEN THEY ARE INFLUENCED BY NONRELIGIOUS IDEAS, AND THEN THEY ARE USUALLY REPROACHED BY MEN JUST AS MUCH AS THEY CAN COUNT‚ÄÎOR AT LEAST COULD COUNT IN FORMER TIMES‚ÄÎON ADMIRATION, EVEN WORSHIP, WHEN ASSOCIATED WITH RELIGION AND THE ULTIMATE MEANING OF EXISTENCE.

SOMETIMES THE HOLY MAN PRACTICES THAT DEFIANCE AGAINST HIMSELF WHICH IS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE LUST TO RULE AT ANY PRICE AND WHICH GIVES EVEN THE LONELIEST THE FEELING OF POWER; SOMETIMES HIS SWOLLEN FEELING CHANGES FROM THE CRAVING TO LET HIS PASSIONS RUN THEIR COURSE INTO THE CRAVING TO MAKE THEM COLLAPSE LIKE WILD HORSES UNDER THE POWERFUL PRESSURE OF A PROUD SOUL; SOMETIMES HE WANTS THE COMPLETE CESSATION OF ALL FEELINGS THAT DISTURB, TORMENT, PROVOKE‚ÄÎA WAKEFUL SLEEP, AN ENDURING REST IN THE LAP OF A DUMB, ANIMAL-OR PLANT-LIKE INDOLENCE; SOMETIMES HE SEEKS A FIGHT AND INFLAMES IT WITHIN HIMSELF BECAUSE BOREDOM FIXES HIM WITH A YAWNING COUNTENANCE: HE SCOURGES HIS SELF-DEIFICATION WITH SELF-CONTEMPT AND CRUELTY, HE DELIGHTS IN THE WILD REBELLION OF HIS DESIRES, IN THE SHARP PAIN OF SIN, EVEN IN THE IDEA THAT HE IS LOST; HE KNOWS HOW TO LAY A SNARE FOR HIS AFFECTS, THAT OF THE MOST EXTREME LUST TO RULE, FOR EXAMPLE, SO THAT IT CHANGES INTO THE MOST EXTREME HUMILIATION AND THIS CONTRAST COMPLETELY UNBALANCES HIS HOUNDED SOUL; AND FINALLY: IF HE SHOULD CRAVE VISIONS OR CONVERSATION WITH THE DEAD OR WITH DIVINE BEINGS, THIS IS AT BOTTOM A RARE KIND OF VOLUPTUOUSNESS THAT HE DESIRES, BUT PERHAPS THAT VOLUPTUOUSNESS IN WHICH ALL THE OTHERS ARE TIED UP INTO ONE KNOT. NOVALIS,6 ONE OF THE AUTHORITIES ON QUESTIONS OF HOLINESS, BOTH BY EXPERIENCE AND BY INSTINCT, ONCE EXPRESSED THE WHOLE SECRET WITH A NA√ØVE JOY: ‚ÄÚIT IS MARVELOUS ENOUGH THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF VOLUPTUOUSNESS, RELIGION, AND CRUELTY HAS NOT LONG ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF MEN TO THEIR CLOSE KINSHIP AND COMMON TENDENCY.‚ÄÙ





143


NOT WHAT THE HOLY MAN IS BUT WHAT HE SIGNIFIES IN THE EYES OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT HOLY GIVES HIM HIS WORLD-HISTORICAL VALUE. IT WAS BECAUSE ONE WAS WRONG ABOUT HIM, BECAUSE ONE MISINTERPRETED THE STATES OF HIS SOUL AND DREW AS SHARP A LINE AS POSSIBLE BETWEEN ONESELF AND HIM, AS IF HE WERE SOMETHING UTTERLY INCOMPARABLE AND STRANGELY SUPERHUMAN‚ÄÎTHAT HE GAINED THAT EXTRAORDINARY POWER WITH WHICH HE COULD DOMINATE THE IMAGINATION OF WHOLE PEOPLES AND AGES. HE DID NOT KNOW HIMSELF; HE UNDERSTOOD THE WRITING OF HIS MOODS, INCLINATIONS, AND ACTIONS ACCORDING TO AN ART OF INTERPRETATION WHICH WAS JUST AS EXTRAVAGANT AND ARTIFICIAL AS THE PNEUMATIC INTERPRETATION OF THE BIBLE. WHAT WAS ECCENTRIC AND SICK IN HIS NATURE, WITH ITS FUSION OF SPIRITUAL POVERTY, FAULTY KNOWLEDGE, SPOILT HEALTH, AND OVEREXCITED NERVES REMAINED CONCEALED FROM HIS OWN EYES AND FROM THE EYES OF THOSE WHO LOOKED AT HIM. HE WAS NOT AN ESPECIALLY GOOD PERSON, EVEN LESS AN ESPECIALLY WISE PERSON; BUT HE SIGNIFIED SOMETHING THAT EXCEEDED ALL HUMAN MEASURE OF GOODNESS AND WISDOM. THE FAITH IN HIM SUPPORTED THE FAITH IN THE DIVINE AND MIRACULOUS, IN A RELIGIOUS MEANING OF ALL EXISTENCE, IN AN IMPENDING FINAL DAY OF JUDGMENT. IN THE EVENING SPLENDOR OF THE WORLD-END‚ÄÔS SUNSET THAT ILLUMINATED THE CHRISTIAN PEOPLES, THE SHADOWY FIGURE OF THE HOLY MAN GREW INTO SOMETHING ENORMOUS‚ÄÎINDEED, TO SUCH A HEIGHT THAT EVEN IN OUR TIME, WHICH NO LONGER BELIEVES IN GOD, THERE ARE STILL THINKERS WHO BELIEVE IN THE HOLY MAN.7





144


IT SCARCELY NEEDS SAYING THAT THIS SKETCH OF THE HOLY MAN, BEING DRAWN AFTER THE AVERAGE OF THE WHOLE SPECIES, CAN BE COUNTERED WITH MANY SKETCHES THAT TEND TO PRODUCE A MORE AGREEABLE FEELING. SINGLE EXCEPTIONS STAND OUT FROM THE SPECIES, WHETHER BY VIRTUE OF GREAT MILDNESS AND HUMANITARIANISM OR BY THE MAGIC OF UNUSUAL ENERGY; OTHERS ARE ATTRACTIVE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE BECAUSE CERTAIN DELUSIONS INUNDATE THEIR WHOLE NATURE WITH LIGHT‚ÄÎAS IS THE CASE, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH THE CELEBRATED FOUNDER OF CHRISTIANITY WHO CONSIDERED HIMSELF THE INBORN SON OF GOD AND THEREFORE FELT HE WAS WITHOUT SIN; THUS, BY VIRTUE OF AN ILLUSION‚ÄÎWHICH SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED TOO HARSHLY, FOR THE WHOLE OF ANTIQUITY WAS FULL OF SONS OF GODS‚ÄÎHE ATTAINED THE SAME GOAL, THE FEELING OF COMPLETE FREEDOM FROM SIN, COMPLETE LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY, WHICH IS NOW AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY BY MEANS OF SCIENCE!

I HAVE ALSO IGNORED THE HOLY MEN OF INDIA WHO OCCUPY AN INTERMEDIATE STAGE BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN HOLY MAN AND THE GREEK PHILOSOPHER, AND THUS DO NOT REPRESENT A PURE TYPE: KNOWLEDGE, SCIENCE‚ÄÎINSOFAR AS SCIENCE EXISTED‚ÄÎRAISING ONESELF ABOVE OTHER MEN THROUGH THE LOGICAL DISCIPLINE AND TRAINING OF THOUGHT, WERE JUST AS MUCH DEMANDED AMONG THE BUDDHISTS, AS A SIGN OF HOLINESS, AS THE SAME QUALITIES WERE REPUDIATED AND PRONOUNCED HERETICAL IN THE CHRISTIAN WORLD WHERE THEY WERE HELD TO BE SIGNS OF UNHOLINESS.

MORES AND THEIR VICTIM.‚ÄÎTHE ORIGIN OF MORES MAY BE FOUND IN TWO THOUGHTS: ‚ÄÚSOCIETY IS WORTH MORE THAN THE INDIVIDUAL,‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚENDURING ADVANTAGE IS TO BE PREFERRED TO EPHEMERAL ADVANTAGE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎFROM WHICH IT FOLLOWS THAT THE ENDURING ADVANTAGE OF SOCIETY MUST BE GIVEN PRECEDENCE, UNCONDITIONALLY, OVER THE ADVANTAGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL, ESPECIALLY OVER HIS MOMENTARY WELL-BEING BUT ALSO OVER HIS ENDURING ADVANTAGE AND EVEN HIS CONTINUED EXISTENCE. WHETHER THE INDIVIDUAL SUFFERS FROM AN INSTITUTION THAT IS GOOD FOR THE WHOLE, WHETHER IT CAUSES HIM TO ATROPHY OR PERISH‚ÄÎMORES MUST BE PRESERVED, SACRIFICES MUST BE MADE. BUT SUCH AN ATTITUDE ORIGINATES ONLY IN THOSE WHO ARE NOT ITS VICTIMS‚ÄÎFOR THEY CLAIM IN THEIR BEHALF THAT THE INDIVIDUAL MAY BE WORTH MORE THAN MANY, ALSO THAT PRESENT ENJOYMENT, THE MOMENT IN PARADISE, MAY HAVE TO BE VALUED HIGHER THAN A PALLID CONTINUATION OF PAINLESS OR COMPLACENT STATES. THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE SACRIFICIAL ANIMAL, HOWEVER, IS ALWAYS SOUNDED TOO LATE; AND SO WE RETAIN MORES AND MORALITY1‚ÄÎWHICH IS NO MORE THAN THE FEELING FOR THE WHOLE QUINTESSENCE OF MORES UNDER WHICH ONE LIVES AND HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP‚ÄÎBROUGHT UP NOT AS AN INDIVIDUAL BUT AS A MEMBER OF A WHOLE, AS A DIGIT OF A MAJORITY.‚ÄÎTHUS IT HAPPENS CONSTANTLY THAT AN INDIVIDUAL BRINGS TO BEAR UPON HIMSELF, BY MEANS OF HIS MORALITY, THE TYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY.2

THUS IT FINDS THE VALUE IN THE FACT THAT THE STRUCTURE CAN BE DESTROYED AND NEVERTHELESS RETAINS VALUE AS BUILDING MATERIAL.

WHY SCHOLARS ARE NOBLER3 THAN ARTISTS.‚ÄÎSCIENCE REQUIRES NOBLER NATURES THAN POETRY DOES: THEY HAVE TO BE SIMPLER, LESS AMBITIOUS, MORE ABSTINENT, QUIETER, NOT SO CONCERNED ABOUT POSTHUMOUS FAME, AND FORGET THEMSELVES OVER MATTERS THAT RARELY SEEM WORTHY IN THE EYES OF MANY OF SUCH A SACRIFICE OF ONE‚ÄÔS PERSONALITY. TO THIS MUST BE ADDED ANOTHER LOSS OF WHICH THEY ARE CONSCIOUS: THE TYPE OF THEIR WORK, THE CONTINUAL DEMAND FOR THE GREATEST SOBRIETY, WEAKENS THEIR WILL; THE FIRE IS NOT KEPT AS STRONG AS ON THE HEARTH OF POETIC NATURES‚ÄÎAND THEREFORE THEY OFTEN LOSE THEIR HIGHEST STRENGTH AND BLOOM AT AN EARLIER AGE THAN THOSE MEN DO‚ÄÎAND, AS MENTIONED, THEY REALIZE THIS DANGER. IN ANY CASE THEY APPEAR LESS GIFTED BECAUSE THEY SHINE LESS, AND THEY WILL BE CONSIDERED INFERIOR TO WHAT THEY ARE.

FOUR PAIRS IT WAS THAT DID NOT DENY THEMSELVES TO MY SACRIFICE: EPICURUS AND MONTAIGNE, GOETHE AND SPINOZA, PLATO AND ROUSSEAU, PASCAL AND SCHOPENHAUER. WITH THESE I MUST COME TO TERMS WHEN I HAVE LONG WANDERED ALONE; THEY MAY CALL ME RIGHT AND WRONG; TO THEM WILL I LISTEN WHEN IN THE PROCESS THEY CALL EACH OTHER RIGHT AND WRONG. WHATSOEVER I SAY, RESOLVE, OR THINK UP FOR MYSELF AND OTHERS‚ÄÎON THESE EIGHT I FIX MY EYES AND SEE THEIR EYES FIXED ON ME.

MAY THE LIVING FORGIVE ME THAT OCCASIONALLY THEY APPEAR TO ME AS SHADES, SO PALE AND SOMBER, SO RESTLESS AND, ALAS, SO LUSTING FOR LIFE‚ÄÎWHILE THOSE MEN THEN SEEM SO ALIVE TO ME AS IF NOW, AFTER DEATH, THEY COULD NEVER AGAIN GROW WEARY OF LIFE.

ELEMENTS OF REVENGE.‚ÄÎTHE WORD ‚ÄÚREVENGE‚ÄÙ IS SAID SO QUICKLY, IT ALMOST SEEMS AS IF IT COULD NOT CONTAIN MORE THAN ONE ROOT CONCEPT AND FEELING. AND SO PEOPLE ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND THIS ROOT‚ÄÎJUST AS OUR ECONOMISTS STILL HAVE NOT GOT TIRED OF SMELLING SUCH A UNITY IN THE WORD ‚ÄÚVALUE‚ÄÙ AND OF LOOKING FOR THE ORIGINAL ROOT CONCEPT OF VALUE. AS IF ALL WORDS WERE NOT POCKETS INTO WHICH NOW THIS AND NOW THAT HAS BEEN PUT, AND NOW MANY THINGS AT ONCE!1 THUS ‚ÄÚREVENGE,‚ÄÙ TOO, IS NOW THIS AND NOW THAT, AND NOW SOMETHING VERY COMPOSITE.

LET US DISTINGUISH, FIRST, THAT RETURN BLOW OF RESISTANCE WHICH IS ALMOST AN INVOLUNTARY REFLEX, EXECUTED EVEN AGAINST LIFELESS OBJECTS THAT HAVE HARMED US (SUCH AS MOVING MACHINES): THE SENSE OF THIS COUNTERMOVE IS TO STOP THE HARM BY BRINGING THE MACHINE TO A HALT. OCCASIONALLY, THE STRENGTH OF THE COUNTERBLOW MUST BE SO STRONG TO SUCCEED IN THIS THAT IT SMASHES THE MACHINE; BUT WHERE THAT IS TOO STRONG TO BE DESTRUCTIBLE IMMEDIATELY BY AN INDIVIDUAL, HE WILL NEVERTHELESS STRIKE AS HARD AS HE CAN‚ÄÎMAKING, AS IT WERE, AN ALL-OUT-ATTEMPT. ONE BEHAVES THE SAME WAY AGAINST PERSONS WHO HARM ONE, AS LONG AS ONE FEELS THE HARM IMMEDIATELY: IF YOU WANT TO CALL THIS ACTION AN ACT OF REVENGE, ALL RIGHT; BUT CONSIDER THAT IT IS ONLY SELF-PRESERVATION THAT HAS HERE PUT ITS RATIONAL MACHINERY INTO MOTION, AND THAT IN THE LAST ANALYSIS ONE DOES NOT THINK AT ALL OF THE HARMING PERSON IN SUCH A CASE BUT ONLY OF ONESELF: WE ACT THAT WAY WITHOUT ANY WISH TO DO HARM IN RETURN, MERELY IN ORDER TO GET AWAY WITH LIFE AND LIMB.

TIME IS NEEDED‚ÄÎWHEN INSTEAD OF CONCENTRATING ON ONESELF ONE BEGINS TO THINK ABOUT ONE‚ÄÔS OPPONENT, ASKING ONESELF HOW ONE CAN HURT HIM THE MOST. THIS HAPPENS IN THE SECOND TYPE OF REVENGE: REFLECTION ON THE OTHER PERSON‚ÄÔS VULNERABILITY AND CAPACITY FOR SUFFERING IS ITS PRESUPPOSITION; ONE WANTS TO HURT. PROTECTING ONESELF AGAINST FURTHER HARM, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS SO LITTLE A CONSIDERATION FOR THE SEEKER OF SUCH VENGEANCE THAT HE ALMOST REGULARLY BRINGS ABOUT FURTHER HARM TO HIMSELF AND QUITE OFTEN ANTICIPATES THIS IN COLD BLOOD. IN THE FIRST TYPE OF REVENGE IT WAS FEAR OF A SECOND BLOW THAT MADE THE COUNTERBLOW AS STRONG AS POSSIBLE; HERE WE FIND ALMOST TOTAL INDIFFERENCE TO WHAT THE OPPONENT WILL DO YET; THE STRENGTH OF THE COUNTERBLOW IS DETERMINED SOLELY BY WHAT HE HAS DONE TO US. BUT WHAT HAS HE DONE? AND WHAT USE IS IT TO US IF HE NOW SUFFERS AFTER WE HAVE SUFFERED ON HIS ACCOUNT? WHAT MATTERS IS A RESTORATION, WHILE THE ACT OF REVENGE OF THE FIRST TYPE SERVES ONLY SELF-PRESERVATION. PERHAPS WE HAVE LOST THROUGH OUR OPPONENT POSSESSIONS, RANK, FRIENDS, CHILDREN: SUCH LOSSES ARE NOT BROUGHT BACK BY REVENGE; THE RESTORATION CONCERNS SOLELY A LOSS INCIDENTAL TO ALL THESE LOSSES. THE REVENGE OF RESTORATION DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINST FURTHER HARM; IT DOES NOT MAKE GOOD THE HARM SUFFERED‚ÄÎEXCEPT IN ONE CASE. IF OUR HONOR HAS SUFFERED FROM OUR OPPONENT, THEN REVENGE CAN RESTORE IT. BUT THIS HAS SUFFERED DAMAGE IN EVERY INSTANCE IN WHICH SUFFERING HAS BEEN INFLICTED ON US DELIBERATELY; FOR OUR OPPONENT THUS DEMONSTRATED THAT HE DID NOT FEAR US. BY REVENGE WE DEMONSTRATE THAT WE DO NOT FEAR HIM EITHER: THIS CONSTITUTES THE EQUALIZATION, THE RESTORATION, (THE INTENT OF SHOWING ONE‚ÄÔS UTTER LACK OF FEAR GOES SO FAR IN SOME PERSONS THAT THE DANGER THEIR REVENGE INVOLVES FOR THEM‚ÄÎLOSS OF HEALTH OR LIFE OR OTHER DAMAGE‚ÄÎIS FOR THEM AN INDISPENSABLE CONDITION OF ALL REVENGE. THEREFORE THEY CHOOSE THE MEANS OF A DUEL ALTHOUGH THE COURTS OFFER THEM HELP IN OBTAINING SATISFACTION FOR THE INSULT: BUT THEY DO NOT ACCEPT AN UN-DANGEROUS RESTORATION OF THEIR HONOR AS SUFFICIENT, BECAUSE IT CANNOT DEMONSTRATE THEIR LACK OF FEAR.)

IN THE FIRST TYPE OF REVENGE IT IS FEAR THAT STRIKES THE COUNTERBLOW; HERE, ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS THE ABSENCE OF FEAR THAT, AS I HAVE TRIED TO SHOW, WANTS TO PROVE ITSELF BY MEANS OF THE COUNTERBLOW.

NOTHING THEREFORE SEEMS MORE DIFFERENT THAN THE INNER MOTIVATION OF THE TWO WAYS OF ACTION THAT ARE CALLED BY ONE NAME, ‚ÄÚREVENGE.‚ÄÙ NEVERTHELESS IT HAPPENS QUITE FREQUENTLY THAT THE PERSON SEEKING REVENGE IS UNCLEAR ABOUT WHAT REALLY INDUCED HIM TO ACT: PERHAPS HE DELIVERED THE COUNTERBLOW FROM FEAR AND IN ORDER TO PRESERVE HIMSELF, BUT LATER, WHEN HE HAS TIME TO THINK ABOUT THE POINT OF HIS INJURED HONOR, HE CONVINCES HIMSELF THAT HE AVENGED HIMSELF FOR HIS HONOR‚ÄÔS SAKE‚ÄÎAFTER ALL, THIS MOTIVE IS NOBLER THAN THE OTHER ONE. MOREOVER, IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT WHETHER HE BELIEVES HIS HONOR TO HAVE BEEN INJURED IN THE EYES OF OTHERS (THE WORLD) OR ONLY IN THE EYES OF THE OPPONENT WHO INSULTED HIM: IN THE LATTER CASE HE WILL PREFER SECRET REVENGE, IN THE FORMER PUBLIC REVENGE. DEPENDING ON WHETHER HE PROJECTS HIMSELF STRONGLY OR WEAKLY INTO THE SOUL OF HIS OPPONENT AND THE SPECTATORS, HIS REVENGE WILL BE MORE EMBITTERED OR TAMER; IF HE LACKS THIS TYPE OF IMAGINATION ENTIRELY, HE WILL NOT THINK OF REVENGE AT ALL, FOR IN THAT CASE THE FEELING FOR ‚ÄÚHONOR‚ÄÙ IS NOT PRESENT IN HIM AND HENCE CANNOT BE INJURED. JUST SO, HE WILL NOT THINK OF REVENGE IF HE DESPISES THE DOER AND THE SPECTATORS OF THE DEED‚ÄÎBECAUSE THEY, BEING DESPISED, CANNOT ACCORD HIM ANY HONOR AND HENCE ALSO CANNOT TAKE IT AWAY. FINALLY, HE WILL FORGO REVENGE IN THE NOT UNUSUAL CASE IN WHICH HE LOVES THE DOER: TO BE SURE, HE THUS LOSES HONOR IN HIS OPPONENT‚ÄÔS EYES AND PERHAPS THUS BECOMES LESS WORTHY OF BEING LOVED IN RETURN. BUT EVEN FORGOING ALL SUCH COUNTERLOVE IS A SACRIFICE THAT LOVE IS PREPARED TO MAKE IF ONLY IT DOES NOT HAVE TO HURT THE BELOVED BEING: THAT WOULD MEAN HURTING ONESELF MORE THAN THIS SACRIFICE HURTS.

THUS: EVERYBODY WILL REVENGE HIMSELF UNLESS HE IS WITHOUT HONOR OR FULL OF CONTEMPT OR FULL OF LOVE FOR THE PERSON WHO HAS HARMED AND INSULTED HIM. EVEN WHEN HE HAS RECOURSE TO THE COURTS HE WANTS REVENGE AS A PRIVATE PERSON‚ÄÎBUT BESIDES, BEING A MEMBER OF SOCIETY WHO THINKS FURTHER AND CONSIDERS THE FUTURE, HE ALSO WANTS SOCIETY‚ÄÔS REVENGE ON ONE WHO DOES NOT HONOR IT. THUS JUDICIAL PUNISHMENT RESTORES BOTH PRIVATE HONOR AND THE HONOR OF SOCIETY‚ÄÎWHICH MEANS, PUNISHMENT IS REVENGE.

INDUBITABLY, IT ALSO CONTAINS THAT OTHER ELEMENT OF REVENGE WHICH WE DESCRIBED FIRST, INSOFAR AS SOCIETY USES PUNISHMENT FOR ITS SELF-PRESERVATION AND DEALS A COUNTERBLOW IN SELF-DEFENSE. PUNISHMENT DESIRES TO PREVENT FURTHER DAMAGE; IT DESIRES TO DETER. THUS BOTH OF THESE SO DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF REVENGE ARE ACTUALLY TIED TOGETHER IN PUNISHMENT, AND PERHAPS THIS IS THE MAIN SUPPORT OF THAT ABOVE-MENTIONED CONCEPTUAL CONFUSION BY VIRTUE OF WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL WHO REVENGES HIMSELF USUALLY DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE REALLY WANTS.

DREAMS.‚ÄÎON THE RARE OCCASIONS WHEN OUR DREAMS SUCCEED AND ACHIEVE PERFECTION‚ÄÎMOST DREAMS ARE BUNGLED‚ÄÎTHEY ARE SYMBOLIC CHAINS OF SCENES AND IMAGES IN PLACE OF A NARRATIVE POETIC LANGUAGE; THEY CIRCUMSCRIBE OUR EXPERIENCES OR EXPECTATIONS OR SITUATIONS WITH SUCH POETIC BOLDNESS AND DECISIVENESS THAT IN THE MORNING WE ARE ALWAYS AMAZED AT OURSELVES WHEN WE REMEMBER OUR DREAMS.

DOES NOT ALMOST EVERY ACCURATE HISTORY OF THE ORIGIN OF SOMETHING SOUND PARADOXICAL AND SACRILEGIOUS TO OUR FEELINGS? DOESN‚ÄÔT THE GOOD HISTORIAN CONTRADICT ALL THE TIME?

THE MORALITY OF VOLUNTARY SUFFERING.‚ÄÎWHAT IS THE SUPREME ENJOYMENT FOR MEN WHO LIVE IN THE STATE OF WAR OF THOSE SMALL, CONTINUALLY ENDANGERED COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THE STRICTEST MORES? IN OTHER WORDS, FOR VIGOROUS, VINDICTIVE, VICIOUS, SUSPICIOUS SOULS WHO ARE PREPARED FOR WHAT IS MOST TERRIBLE AND HARDENED BY DEPRIVATIONS AND MORES? THE ENJOYMENT OF CRUELTY; AND IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS EVEN ACCOUNTED AMONG THE VIRTUES OF SUCH A SOUL IF IT IS INVENTIVE AND INSATIABLE IN CRUELTY. THE COMMUNITY FEELS REFRESHED BY CRUEL DEEDS, AND CASTS OFF FOR ONCE THE GLOOM OF CONTINUAL ANXIETY AND CAUTION. CRUELTY BELONGS TO THE MOST ANCIENT FESTIVE JOYS OF MANKIND. HENCE ONE SUPPOSES THAT THE GODS, TOO, FEEL REFRESHED AND FESTIVE WHEN ONE OFFERS THEM THE SIGHT OF CRUELTY; AND SO THE IDEA CREEPS INTO THE WORLD THAT VOLUNTARY SUFFERING, TORTURE ONE HAS CHOSEN ONESELF, HAS VALUE AND MAKES GOOD SENSE.

GRADUALLY, THE MORES SHAPE A COMMUNAL PRACTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS IDEA: ALL EXTRAVAGANT WELL-BEING HENCEFORTH AROUSES SOME MISTRUST, AND ALL HARD AND PAINFUL STATES MORE AND MORE CONFIDENCE. ONE SUPPOSES THAT THE GODS MIGHT LOOK UPON US UNGRACIOUSLY BECAUSE OF OUR HAPPINESS, AND GRACIOUSLY BECAUSE OF OUR SUFFERING‚ÄÎNOT BY ANY MEANS WITH PITY. FOR PITY IS CONSIDERED CONTEMPTIBLE AND UNWORTHY OF A STRONG AND TERRIBLE SOUL. RATHER, GRACIOUSLY, BECAUSE IT DELIGHTS THEM AND PUTS THEM INTO GOOD SPIRITS; FOR THOSE WHO ARE CRUEL ENJOY THE SUPREME TITILLATION OF THE FEELING OF POWER.1

THUS THE CONCEPT OF THE ‚ÄÚMOST MORAL MAN‚ÄÙ OF THE COMMUNITY COMES TO CONTAIN THE VIRTUE OF FREQUENT SUFFERING, DEPRIVATION, A HARD WAY OF LIFE, AND OF CRUEL SELF-MORTIFICATION‚ÄÎNOT, TO SAY THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN, AS A MEANS OF SELF-DISCIPLINE, SELF-CONTROL, AND THE DESIRE FOR INDIVIDUAL HAPPINESS, BUT AS A VIRTUE THAT MAKES THE COMMUNITY LOOK GOOD TO THE EVIL GODS, STEAMING UP TO THEM LIKE A CONTINUAL SACRIFICE OF ATONEMENT UPON SOME ALTAR. ALL THOSE SPIRITUAL LEADERS OF PEOPLES WHO SUCCEEDED IN STIRRING SOMETHING IN THE INERT BUT FERTILE MUD OF THEIR MORES, HAD NEED NOT ONLY OF MADNESS BUT ALSO OF VOLUNTARY TORTURE TO ENGENDER FAITH‚ÄÎAND MOST AND FIRST OF ALL, AS ALWAYS, THEIR FAITH IN THEMSELVES. THE MORE THEIR OWN SPIRIT MOVED ALONG NOVEL PATHS AND WAS THEREFORE TORMENTED BY PANGS OF CONSCIENCE AND ANXIETIES, THE MORE CRUELLY THEY RAGED AGAINST THEIR OWN FLESH, THEIR OWN DESIRES, AND THEIR OWN HEALTH‚ÄÎAS IF THEY WANTED TO OFFER THE DEITY SOME SUBSTITUTE GRATIFICATION IN CASE IT SHOULD PERHAPS BE EMBITTERED ON ACCOUNT OF CUSTOMS ONE HAD NEGLECTED AND FOUGHT AGAINST AND NEW GOALS ONE HAD CHAMPIONED.

LET US NOT BELIEVE TOO QUICKLY THAT NOW WE HAVE RID OURSELVES COMPLETELY OF SUCH A LOGIC OF FEELING. LET THE MOST HEROIC SOULS QUESTION THEMSELVES ABOUT THIS. EVERY SMALLEST STEP ON THE FIELD OF FREE THOUGHT AND THE INDIVIDUALLY FORMED LIFE HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOUGHT FOR WITH SPIRITUAL AND PHYSICAL TORMENTS: NOT ONLY MOVING FORWARD, NO, ABOVE ALL MOVING, MOTION, CHANGE HAVE REQUIRED INNUMERABLE MARTYRS, ALL THROUGH THE LONG PATH-SEEKING AND BASIC MILLENNIA OF WHICH, TO BE SURE, PEOPLE DON‚ÄÔT THINK WHEN THEY TALK, AS USUAL, ABOUT ‚ÄÚWORLD HISTORY,‚ÄÙ THAT RIDICULOUSLY SMALL SEGMENT OF HUMAN EXISTENCE. AND EVEN IN THIS SO-CALLED WORLD HISTORY, WHICH IS AT BOTTOM MUCH ADO ABOUT THE LATEST NEWS, THERE IS NO REALLY MORE IMPORTANT THEME THAN THE PRIMORDIAL TRAGEDY OF THE MARTYRS WHO WANTED TO MOVE THE SWAMPS.

NOTHING HAS BEEN BOUGHT MORE DEARLY THAN THAT LITTLE BIT OF HUMAN REASON AND OF A FEELING OF FREEDOM THAT NOW CONSTITUTES OUR PRIDE. BUT IT IS THIS VERY PRIDE THAT NOW MAKES IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO FEEL WITH THOSE VAST SPANS OF TIME CHARACTERIZED BY THE ‚ÄÚMORALITY OF MORES‚ÄÙ2 WHICH ANTEDATE ‚ÄÚWORLD HISTORY‚ÄÙ AS THE REAL AND DECISIVE MAIN HISTORY THAT DETERMINED THE CHARACTER OF HUMANITY‚ÄÎWHEN SUFFERING WAS A VIRTUE, CRUELTY A VIRTUE, DISSIMULATION A VIRTUE, REVENGE A VIRTUE, THE SLANDER OF REASON A VIRTUE, WHILE WELL-BEING WAS A DANGER, THE CRAVING FOR KNOWLEDGE A DANGER, PEACE A DANGER, PITY A DANGER, BEING PITIED IGNOMINY, WORK IGNOMINY, MADNESS DIVINE, CHANGE IMMORAL3 AND PREGNANT WITH DISASTER.

YOU THINK THAT ALL THIS HAS CHANGED, AND THAT HUMANITY MUST THUS HAVE CHANGED ITS CHARACTER? YOU WHO THINK YOU KNOW MEN, LEARN TO KNOW YOURSELVES BETTER!

ON THE NATURAL HISTORY OF DUTY AND RIGHT.‚ÄÎOUR DUTIES‚ÄÎARE THE RIGHTS OTHERS HAVE AGAINST US. HOW DID THE OTHERS ACQUIRE THESE RIGHTS? BY TAKING US TO BE CAPABLE OF CONTRACTS AND OF REPAYMENT, AS EQUAL AND SIMILAR TO THEM; BY ENTRUSTING US WITH SOMETHING ON THIS BASIS AND EDUCATING, CORRECTING, AND SUPPORTING US. WE DO OUR DUTY‚ÄÎTHAT MEANS: WE JUSTIFY THIS IDEA OF OUR POWER ON THE BASIS OF WHICH WE HAVE BEEN TREATED THIS WAY; WE GIVE BACK IN THE SAME MEASURE IN WHICH ONE HAS GIVEN TO US. THUS IT IS OUR PRIDE THAT BIDS US DO OUR DUTY‚ÄÎWE WANT TO REGAIN OUR SOVEREIGNTY WHEN WE BALANCE WHAT OTHERS HAVE DONE FOR US WITH SOMETHING WE DO FOR THEM‚ÄÎFOR IN THIS WAY THEY HAVE INTRUDED INTO THE SPHERE OF OUR POWER AND WOULD KEEP THEIR HAND IN IT CONSTANTLY IF WE DID NOT REPAY THEM WITH OUR ‚ÄÚDUTY,‚ÄÙ WHICH MEANS THAT WE INTRUDE INTO THEIR POWER. THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS CAN RELATE ONLY TO WHAT IS WITHIN OUR POWER; IT WOULD BE UNREASONABLE IF THEY WANTED SOMETHING FROM US THAT DOES NOT BELONG TO US. TO BE MORE PRECISE ONE SHOULD SAY: ONLY TO WHAT THEY SUPPOSE IS WITHIN OUR POWER, ASSUMING THAT IT IS THE SAME THING WE SUPPOSE TO BE WITHIN OUR POWER. THE SAME ERROR COULD EASILY BE MADE ON BOTH SIDES: THE SENSE OF A DUTY DEPENDS ON OUR SHARING WITH THE OTHERS THE SAME FAITH ABOUT THE EXTENT OF OUR POWER: NAMELY, THAT WE PROMISE CERTAIN THINGS AND ARE CAPABLE OF INCURRING THESE DUTIES (‚ÄÚFREEDOM OF THE WILL‚ÄÙ).

MY RIGHTS: THEY DEFINE THAT PART OF MY POWER WHICH THE OTHERS HAVE NOT ONLY CONCEDED TO ME BUT IN WHICH THEY WISH TO PRESERVE ME. WHAT LEADS THE OTHERS TO DO THIS? FIRST, THEIR PRUDENCE AND FEAR AND CAUTION‚ÄÎWHETHER THEY EXPECT SOMETHING SIMILAR IN RETURN FROM US (PROTECTION OF THEIR RIGHTS), OR CONSIDER A FIGHT WITH US DANGEROUS OR POINTLESS, OR SEE IN EVERY DIMINUTION OF OUR STRENGTH A DISADVANTAGE FOR THEMSELVES BECAUSE IT WOULD RENDER US UNFIT FOR AN ALLIANCE WITH THEM AGAINST A THIRD AND HOSTILE POWER. THEN, DEEDING OR CEDING. IN THIS CASE THE OTHERS HAVE POWER ENOUGH, MORE THAN ENOUGH, TO BE ABLE TO GIVE SOME OF IT AWAY AND TO GUARANTEE THE PIECE THEY GIVE AWAY TO THE PERSON WHO RECEIVES IT‚ÄÎIN WHICH CASE A SLIGHT FEELING OF POWER IS ASSUMED IN THE PERSON WHO ACCEPTS THE PRESENT. THUS RIGHTS ORIGINATE: RECOGNIZED AND GUARANTEED DEGREES OF POWER. IF THE PROPORTIONS OF POWER ARE CHANGED DRASTICALLY, RIGHTS PASS AWAY, AND NEW RIGHTS COME TO BE‚ÄÎWHICH IS APPARENT IN INTERNATIONAL LAW WITH ITS CONSTANT PASSING AWAY AND COMING TO BE. IF OUR POWER IS DECREASED DRASTICALLY, THE FEELINGS OF THOSE WHO HAVE SO FAR GUARANTEED OUR RIGHTS CHANGE: THEY CONSIDER WHETHER THEY CAN RESTORE US TO OUR OLD FULL POSSESSION‚ÄÎAND IF THEY FEEL INCAPABLE OF THAT, THEN THEY DENY OUR ‚ÄÚRIGHTS‚ÄÙ HENCEFORTH. JUST SO, WHEN OUR POWER IS INCREASED DRASTICALLY, THE FEELINGS OF THOSE CHANGE WHO HAVE SO FAR RECOGNIZED IT AND WHOSE RECOGNITION WE NOW NO LONGER NEED: THEY MAY TRY TO REDUCE OUR POWER TO ITS FORMER MEASURE, THEY MAY WISH TO INTERFERE, INVOKING THEIR ‚ÄÚDUTY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎBUT THIS IS JUST A WASTE OF WORDS. WHERE RIGHT RULES, A STATE AND DEGREE OF POWER IS PRESERVED, AND A DIMINUTION AND INCREASE ARE RESISTED. THE RIGHT OF OTHERS IS THE CONCESSION OF OUR FEELING OF POWER TO THE FEELING OF POWER AMONG THESE OTHERS. WHEN OUR POWER IS PROVED TO HAVE BEEN PROFOUNDLY SHAKEN AND BROKEN, OUR RIGHTS CEASE; ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN WE HAVE BECOME A GREAT DEAL MORE POWERFUL, THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS CEASE FOR US, AT LEAST IN THE FORM IN WHICH WE HAVE SO FAR CONCEDED THEM.

THE ‚ÄÚFAIR PERSON‚ÄÙ CONSTANTLY NEEDS THE FINE TACT OF A SCALE FOR THE DEGREES OF POWER AND RIGHT WHICH, IN VIEW OF THE TRANSITORY NATURE OF HUMAN AFFAIRS, WILL ALWAYS BE BALANCED ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME, WHILE FOR THE MOST PART THEY EITHER SINK OR RISE: TO BE FAIR IS THEREFORE DIFFICULT AND REQUIRES MUCH PRACTICE, GOOD WILL, AND A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD SPIRIT.‚ÄÎ

TO THE PREACHERS OF MORALS.‚ÄÎI HAVE NO WISH TO ESTABLISH MORALS, BUT I HAVE THIS ADVICE FOR THOSE WHO DO: IF YOU WANT TO DO THE BEST THINGS AND STATES OUT OF ALL HONOR AND WORTH, THEN CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THEM AS YOU HAVE BEEN DOING. PLACE THEM AT THE HEAD OF YOUR MORALITY AND TALK FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT OF THE HAPPINESS OF VIRTUE, OF PEACE OF SOUL, OF JUSTICE AND IMMANENT RETRIBUTION: THE WAY YOU ARE CARRYING ON, ALL THESE GOOD THINGS FINALLY ACQUIRE A POPULARITY AND ARE SHOUTED ABOUT IN THE STREETS; BUT AT THE SAME TIME ALL OF THEIR GOLD WILL BE WORN OFF, AND EVEN WORSE‚ÄÎALL THE GOLD THAT WAS IN THEM WILL HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO LEAD. TRULY, YOU ARE MASTERS OF INVERSE ALCHEMY, OF THE DEVALUATION OF THE MOST VALUABLE THINGS. WHY DON‚ÄÔT YOU REACH, EXPERIMENTALLY, FOR ANOTHER RECIPE, LEST YOU KEEP ATTAINING THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU SEEK: DENY THESE GOOD THINGS, DEPRIVE THEM OF THE MOB‚ÄÔS ACCLAIM AND THEIR CONSTANT CURRENCY; RESTORE THEM TO THE CONCEALED BASHFULNESS OF SOLITARY SOULS; SAY THAT MORALITY IS SOMETHING FORBIDDEN. PERHAPS YOU WILL IN THAT WAY GAIN THE SUPPORT FOR THESE THINGS OF THE ONLY TYPE OF MEN THAT MATTER‚ÄÎTHOSE WHO ARE HEROIC. BUT THEN THEY MUST HAVE A QUALITY THAT INSPIRES FEAR, AND NOT, AS HITHERTO, NAUSEA. SHOULD WE NOT SAY OF MORALITY TODAY WHAT MASTER ECKHART5 SAID: ‚ÄÚI ASK GOD THAT HE RID ME OF GOD.‚ÄÙ





312


MY DOG.‚ÄÎI HAVE GIVEN A NAME TO MY PAIN AND CALL IT ‚ÄÚDOG‚ÄÙ: IT IS JUST AS FAITHFUL, JUST AS OBTRUSIVE AND SHAMELESS, JUST AS ENTERTAINING, JUST AS CLEVER AS ANY OTHER DOG‚ÄÎAND I CAN SCOLD IT AND VENT MY BAD MOODS ON IT, AS OTHERS DO WITH THEIR DOGS, SERVANTS, AND WIVES.





316


PROPHETIC MEN.‚ÄÎYOU HAVE NO FEELING FOR THE FACT THAT PROPHETIC MEN ARE MEN WHO SUFFER A GREAT DEAL: YOU MERELY SUPPOSE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN GRANTED A BEAUTIFUL ‚ÄÚGIFT,‚ÄÙ AND YOU WOULD EVEN LIKE TO HAVE IT YOURSELF. BUT I SHALL EXPRESS MYSELF IN A PARABLE. HOW MUCH MAY ANIMALS SUFFER FROM THE ELECTRICITY IN THE AIR AND CLOUDS! WE SEE HOW SOME SPECIES HAVE A PROPHETIC FACULTY REGARDING THE WEATHER; MONKEYS, FOR EXAMPLE (AS MAY BE OBSERVED EVEN IN EUROPE, AND NOT ONLY IN ZOOS‚ÄÎNAMELY, ON GIBRALTAR). BUT WE DO NOT HEED THAT IT IS THEIR PAINS THAT MAKE THEM PROPHETS. WHEN A STRONG POSITIVE ELECTRICAL CHARGE, UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF AN APPROACHING CLOUD THAT IS AS YET FAR FROM VISIBLE, SUDDENLY CHANGES INTO NEGATIVE ELECTRICITY, THESE ANIMALS BEHAVE AS IF AN ENEMY WERE DRAWING NEAR AND PREPARE FOR DEFENSE OR ESCAPE; MOST OFTEN THEY TRY TO HIDE: THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND BAD WEATHER AS A KIND OF WEATHER BUT AS AN ENEMY WHOSE HAND THEY ALREADY FEEL.





322


PARABLE.‚ÄÎTHOSE THINKERS IN WHOM ALL STARS MOVE IN CYCLIC ORBITS ARE NOT THE MOST PROFOUND: WHOEVER LOOKS INTO HIMSELF AS INTO VAST SPACE AND CARRIES GALAXIES IN HIMSELF ALSO KNOWS HOW IRREGULAR ALL GALAXIES ARE; THEY LEAD INTO THE CHAOS AND LABYRINTH OF EXISTENCE.





325


WHAT BELONGS TO GREATNESS.‚ÄÎWHO WILL ATTAIN ANYTHING GREAT IF HE DOES NOT POSSESS THE STRENGTH AND THE WILL TO INFLICT GREAT SUFFERING? BEING ABLE TO SUFFER IS THE LEAST THING: WEAK WOMEN AND EVEN SLAVES OFTEN ATTAIN MASTERY IN THAT. BUT NOT TO PERISH OF INNER DISTRESS AND UNCERTAINTY WHEN ONE INFLICTS GREAT SUFFERING AND HEARS THE CRY OF THIS SUFFERING‚ÄÎTHAT IS GREAT, THAT BELONGS TO GREATNESS.6





327


TAKING SERIOUSLY.‚ÄÎIN THE GREAT MAJORITY, THE INTELLECT IS A CLUMSY, GLOOMY, CREAKING MACHINE THAT IS DIFFICULT TO START. THEY CALL IT ‚ÄÚTAKING THE MATTER SERIOUSLY,‚ÄÙ WHEN THEY WORK WITH THIS MACHINE AND WANT TO THINK WELL: HOW ONEROUS THEY MUST FIND THINKING WELL! THE LOVELY BEAST, MAN, SEEMS TO LOSE ITS GOOD SPIRITS EVERY TIME IT THINKS WELL: IT BECOMES ‚ÄÚSERIOUS.‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚWHERE LAUGHTER AND GAIETY ARE FOUND, THE QUALITY OF THOUGHT IS POOR‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT IS THE PREJUDICE OF THIS SERIOUS BEAST AGAINST ALL ‚ÄÚGAY SCIENCE.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWELL, THEN, LET US PROVE THAT IT IS A PREJUDICE.7





332


THE BAD HOUR.‚ÄÎEVERY PHILOSOPHER HAS PROBABLY HAD A BAD HOUR WHEN HE THOUGHT: WHAT DO I MATTER IF ONE DOES NOT ACCEPT MY BAD ARGUMENTS, TOO?‚ÄÎ AND THEN SOME MISCHIEVOUS8 LITTLE BIRD FLEW PAST HIM AND TWITTERED: ‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU MATTER? WHAT DO YOU MATTER?‚ÄÙ





3819


ON THE QUESTION OF BEING UNDERSTANDABLE.‚ÄÎONE DOES NOT ONLY WISH TO BE UNDERSTOOD WHEN ONE WRITES; ONE WISHES JUST AS SURELY NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD. IT IS NOT BY ANY MEANS NECESSARILY AN OBJECTION TO A BOOK WHEN ANYBODY FINDS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND: PERHAPS THAT WAS PART OF THE AUTHOR‚ÄÔS INTENTION‚ÄÎHE DID NOT WANT TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY JUST ‚ÄÚANYBODY.‚ÄÙ EVERY MORE NOBLE SPIRIT AND TASTE SELECTS ITS AUDIENCE WHEN IT WISHES TO COMMUNICATE ITSELF; AND CHOOSING THEM, IT AT THE SAME TIME ERECTS BARRIERS AGAINST ‚ÄÚTHE OTHERS.‚ÄÙ ALL THE MORE SUBTLE LAWS OF ANY STYLE HAVE THEIR ORIGIN AT THIS POINT: THEY AT THE SAME TIME KEEP AWAY, CREATE A DISTANCE, FORBID ‚ÄÚENTRANCE,‚ÄÙ UNDERSTANDING, AS SAID ABOVE‚ÄÎWHILE THEY OPEN THE EARS OF THOSE WHOSE EARS ARE RELATED TO OURS.

AND LET ME SAY THIS AMONG OURSELVES AND ABOUT MY OWN CASE: I DON‚ÄÔT WANT EITHER MY IGNORANCE OR THE LIVELINESS OF MY TEMPERAMENT TO KEEP ME FROM BEING UNDERSTANDABLE FOR YOU, MY FRIENDS‚ÄÎNOT THE LIVELINESS, HOWEVER MUCH IT COMPELS ME TO TACKLE A MATTER SWIFTLY TO TACKLE IT AT ALL. FOR I APPROACH DEEP PROBLEMS LIKE COLD BATHS: QUICKLY INTO THEM AND QUICKLY OUT AGAIN. THAT ONE DOES NOT GET TO THE DEPTHS THAT WAY, NOT DEEP ENOUGH DOWN, IS THE SUPERSTITION OF THOSE AFRAID OF THE WATER, THE ENEMIES OF COLD WATER; THEY SPEAK WITHOUT EXPERIENCE. THE FREEZING COLD MAKES ONE SWIFT.

AND TO ASK THIS INCIDENTALLY: DOES A MATTER NECESSARILY REMAIN UNUNDERSTOOD AND UNFATHOMED MERELY BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN TOUCHED ONLY IN FLIGHT, GLANCED AT, IN A FLASH? IS IT ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE THAT ONE SETTLES DOWN ON IT? THAT ONE HAS BROODED OVER IT AS OVER AN EGG? DIU NOCTUQUE INCUBANDO, AS NEWTON SAID OF HIMSELF? AT LEAST THERE ARE TRUTHS THAT ARE SINGULARLY SHY AND TICKLISH AND CANNOT BE CAUGHT EXCEPT SUDDENLY‚ÄÎTHAT MUST BE SURPRISED OR LEFT ALONE.

FINALLY, MY BREVITY HAS YET ANOTHER VALUE: GIVEN SUCH QUESTIONS AS CONCERN ME, I MUST SAY MANY THINGS BRIEFLY IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY BE HEARD STILL MORE BRIEFLY. FOR, BEING AN IMMORALIST, ONE HAS TO TAKE STEPS AGAINST CORRUPTING INNOCENTS‚ÄÎI MEAN, ASSES AND OLD MAIDS OF BOTH SEXES WHOM LIFE OFFERS NOTHING BUT THEIR INNOCENCE. EVEN MORE, MY WRITINGS SHOULD INSPIRE, ELEVATE, AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO BE VIRTUOUS. I CANNOT IMAGINE ANYTHING ON EARTH THAT WOULD BE A MERRIER SIGHT THAN INSPIRED OLD ASSES AND MAIDS WHO FEEL EXCITED BY THE SWEET SENTIMENTS OF VIRTUE; AND ‚ÄÚTHIS I HAVE SEEN‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA.

SO MUCH REGARDING BREVITY. MATTERS STAND WORSE WITH MY IGNORANCE WHICH I DO NOT TRY TO CONCEAL FROM MYSELF. THERE ARE HOURS WHEN I FEEL ASHAMED OF IT‚ÄÎTO BE SURE, ALSO HOURS WHEN I FEEL ASHAMED OF FEELING ASHAMED. PERHAPS ALL OF US PHILOSOPHERS ARE IN A BAD POSITION NOWADAYS REGARDING KNOWLEDGE: SCIENCE KEEPS GROWING, AND THE MOST SCHOLARLY AMONG US ARE CLOSE TO DISCOVERING THAT THEY KNOW TOO LITTLE. BUT IT WOULD BE STILL WORSE IF IT WERE DIFFERENT‚ÄÎAND WE KNEW TOO MUCH; OUR TASK IS AND REMAINS ABOVE ALL NOT TO MISTAKE OURSELVES FOR OTHERS. WE ARE SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM SCHOLARS, ALTHOUGH IT IS UNAVOIDABLE FOR US TO BE ALSO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SCHOLARLY. WE HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS, GROW DIFFERENTLY, AND ALSO HAVE A DIFFERENT DIGESTION: WE NEED MORE, WE ALSO NEED LESS. HOW MUCH A SPIRIT NEEDS FOR ITS NOURISHMENT, FOR THIS THERE IS NO FORMULA; BUT IF ITS TASTE IS FOR INDEPENDENCE, FOR QUICK COMING AND GOING, FOR ROAMING, PERHAPS FOR ADVENTURES FOR WHICH ONLY THE SWIFTEST ARE A MATCH, IT IS BETTER FOR SUCH A SPIRIT TO LIVE IN FREEDOM WITH LITTLE TO EAT THAN UNFREE AND STUFFED. IT IS NOT FAT BUT THE GREATEST POSSIBLE SUPPLENESS AND STRENGTH THAT A GOOD DANCER DESIRES FROM HIS NOURISHMENT‚ÄÎAND I WOULD NOT KNOW WHAT THE SPIRIT OF A PHILOSOPHER MIGHT WISH MORE TO BE THAN A GOOD DANCER. FOR THE DANCE IS HIS IDEAL, ALSO HIS ART, AND FINALLY ALSO HIS ONLY PIETY, HIS ‚ÄÚSERVICE OF GOD.‚ÄÙ


1THE THEME OF THIS SECTION IS TAKEN UP AGAIN IN BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL (1886), SECTION 260, WHERE WE GAIN THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION‚ÄÎTHOUGH NIETZSCHE IS NOT AS EMPHATIC AS IN THE LAST SENTENCE ABOVE‚ÄÎTHAT OUR CURRENT MORALITY IS A MIXED TYPE. IT WOULD SEEM THAT THIS BECAME HIS CONSIDERED VIEW, NOTWITHSTANDING THE WIDESPREAD MISAPPREHENSION THAT HE CONSIDERED MODERN MORALITY AN EXAMPLE OF ‚ÄÚSLAVE MORALITY.‚ÄÙ MOST IMPORTANT: AS THE ABOVE APHORISM MAKES ABUNDANTLY CLEAR, NIETZSCHE IS NOT CONCERNED TO DIVIDE THE MEN AMONG WHOM HE LIVES INTO MASTERS AND SLAVES; HE IS CONCERNED WITH THE HISTORY, THE GENESIS, THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS. AND IN THE PREFACE TO THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS (1887), NIETZSCHE REFERS TO SEVERAL EARLY APHORISMS, INCLUDING THIS ONE.

HIS REFERENCES TO PASCAL AND ROUSSEAU, ESPECIALLY ROUSSEAU, ARE GENERALLY VERY CRITICAL.

7THIS APHORISM, AND THE WHOLE CONCEPTION OF THE ‚ÄÚGAY SCIENCE,‚ÄÙ SHOULD BE RECALLED IN CONNECTION WITH NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS INQUIRY CONCERNING ‚ÄÚASCETIC IDEALS‚ÄÙ IN THE GENEALOGY.

NIETZSCHE WAS CONTROVERSIAL TO THE MARROW. HE SOUGHT CONTROVERSY AND IS STILL CONTROVERSIAL. BUT THE AREA OF AGREEMENT ABOUT HIM IS GROWING. WHAT THE GERMANS AND THE FRENCH HAVE KNOWN FOR SOME TIME IS GRADUALLY BEING RECOGNIZED IN THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING WORLD AS WELL: NIETZSCHE WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST GERMAN WRITERS AND PHILOSOPHERS OF ALL TIME AND ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING AND INFLUENTIAL EUROPEANS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL IS ONE OF HIS MOST IMPORTANT BOOKS, AND ITS NINE PARTS WITH THEIR DESCRIPTIVE SUBTITLES ARE DESIGNED TO GIVE THE READER A COMPREHENSIVE IDEA OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS THOUGHT AND STYLE.

FOR ALL THAT, THE BOOK, LIKE ALL OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS BEST VOLUMES, IS EASILY MISUNDERSTOOD. FOR READERS WHO COME TO IT WITH NO PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF NIETZSCHE OR WITH ERRONEOUS PRECONCEPTIONS ABOUT HIM, I HAVE VENTURED TO OFFER SOMETHING OF A COMMENTARY IN THE FORM OF COPIOUS FOOTNOTES. ALL OF THE FOOTNOTES ARE MINE; NONE ARE NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS.

I HAVE CHOSEN TO USE NOTES FOR ELUCIDATION OF MAJOR AND MINOR POINTS IN THE TEXT RATHER THAN A LONG INTRODUCTION OR INTERLARDED COMMENTARIES BECAUSE SUCH NOTES CAN PROVIDE IMMEDIATE CLARIFICATION OR INTERPRETATION FOR THE READER WHO REQUIRES SUCH ASSISTANCE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE READER CAN SKIP THE NOTES IF HE WISHES, AND READ NIETZSCHE STRAIGHT THROUGH WITHOUT THE INTRUSION OF THE EDITOR‚ÄÔS COMMENTARIES.

ANOTHER POSSIBILITY WOULD HAVE BEEN TO OFFER THE COMMENTARY ON FACING PAGES, AS I MYSELF HAVE DONE IN THE CASE OF HEGEL‚ÄÔS LONG PREFACE TO THE PHENOMENOLOGY. BUT NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS BOOK IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT: ONE CAN READ IT LIKE AN ORDINARY BOOK, AND MANY PAGES REQUIRE NO ELUCIDATION. EVERYTHING CONSIDERED, THEN, IT SEEMED BEST TO OFFER THE COMMENTARY IN THE FORM OF NOTES‚ÄÎNONE ON SOME PAGES, SEVERAL ON OTHERS.

TO KEEP DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE COMMENTARY AND TO AVOID EXCESSIVE REPETITION OF MATERIAL AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE, I HAVE REFERRED TO DETAILED DISCUSSION OF MANY POINTS IN MY OWN NIETZSCHE VOLUME.

A WORD ABOUT THE TEXT: IT WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN 1886, FOLLOWING THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA, WHICH IS GENERALLY AND RIGHTLY REGARDED AS NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS FIRST ATTEMPT TO PRESENT HIS WHOLE PHILOSOPHY. ALL OF HIS PREVIOUS WORKS HAD BEEN STAGES IN HIS DEVELOPMENT: WITH ZARATHUSTRA THE FINAL PHASE BEGINS; A COMPREHENSIVE VISION HAS BEEN ATTAINED BUT IS FAR FROM EASY TO COMMUNICATE. ZARATHUSTRA, THOUGH MUCH OF THE WORK CONSISTS OF APPARENTLY DIRECT PREACHING, IS A FORM OF ‚ÄÚINDIRECT COMMUNICATION,‚ÄÙ TO USE KIERKEGAARD‚ÄÔS TERM: THE FORM IS LITERARY AND THERE IS AN ABUNDANCE OF SYMBOLISM. FOR THOSE WHO KNOW THE AUTHOR WELL, THE BOOK IS A STUNNING EPITOME OF HIS THOUGHT; FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT, SOME OTHER APPROACH IS NEEDED. IT WAS WITH THIS IN MIND THAT NIETZSCHE WROTE BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL. AND ON SEPTEMBER 22, 1886, HE WROTE JACOB BURCKHARDT: ‚ÄÚPLEASE READ THIS BOOK (ALTHOUGH IT SAYS THE SAME THINGS AS MY ZARATHUSTRA, BUT DIFFERENTLY, VERY DIFFERENTLY‚ÄÎ).‚ÄÙ

THE FIRST EDITION WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT NIETZSCHE HIMSELF SUPERVISED. IN A LETTER TO HIS FRIEND FRANZ OVERBECK, HE WROTE: ‚ÄÚI AM MAKING THE EXPERIMENT OF HAVING SOMETHING PUBLISHED AT MY EXPENSE: ASSUMING 300 COPIES WILL BE SOLD, MY EXPENSES WILL BE COVERED AND I MIGHT BE ABLE TO REPEAT THE EXPERIMENT SOME TIME. THE FIRM OF C. G. NAUMANN PERMITS THE USE OF ITS HIGHLY RESPECTABLE NAME. THIS BETWEEN US. THE NEGLECT BY SCHM.1 WAS MONSTROUS: FOR TEN YEARS NOW NO COPIES DISTRIBUTED TO BOOKSTORES; NEITHER ANY REVIEW COPIES ‚Ä¶ NO PROMOTION‚ÄÎIN SHORT, MY WRITINGS BEGINNING WITH HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN ARE ‚ÄÒANECDOTA.‚ÄÔ OF ZARATHUSTRA 60-70 COPIES EACH2 HAVE BEEN SOLD, ETC., ETC.‚ÄÙ3

THE BOOK OF WHICH NIETZSCHE HAD HOPED TO SELL 300 COPIES WAS BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, BUT A YEAR LATER, JUNE 8, 1887, HE WRITES PETER GAST: ‚ÄÚTHIS TIME, FOR BEY. G. & E., EVERYTHING NECESSARY (AND EVEN A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT) HAS BEEN DONE AS FAR AS THE BOOK TRADE IS CONCERNED: SO HERR SCHMEITZNER CANNOT BE BLAMED ANY MORE, AS I HAD DONE SO FAR. IN SPITE OF ALL THIS‚ÄÎTHE RESULT IS THE SAME AS WITH SCHMEITZNER: RATHER, IT IS STILL WORSE! ALTOGETHER ONLY 114 COPIES HAVE BEEN SOLD (WHILE 66 COPIES HAVE BEEN GIVEN AWAY TO NEWSPAPERS AND JOURNALS).

‚ÄÚINSTRUCTIVE! NAMELY, ONE SIMPLY DOES NOT WANT MY LITERATURE; AND I‚ÄÎMAY NO LONGER AFFORD THE LUXURY OF PRINT.‚ÄÙ4

BY 1903, 17,000 COPIES WERE IN PRINT; BY 1906, 36,000. SINCE THEN NEW EDITIONS AND TRANSLATIONS INTO OTHER LANGUAGES HAVE MUSHROOMED.

THE FIRST EDITION HAS BECOME A GREAT RARITY AND HAS NEVER BEEN REPRINTED EXACTLY AS PUBLISHED IN 1886. ALL SUBSEQUENT EDITIONS CONTAIN A FEW VERY MINOR DEVIATIONS. KARL SCHLECHTA‚ÄÔS EDITION OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS WORKS IN THREE VOLUMES5 IS WIDELY CONSIDERED VASTLY SUPERIOR TO ALL PREVIOUS EDITIONS, AT LEAST PHILOLOGICALLY, ALTHOUGH IT CONTAINS MUCH LESS OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS NACHLASS6 THAN SOME EARLIER EDITIONS; AND SCHLECHTA CLAIMS UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT HE HAS FOLLOWED THE ORIGINAL EDITION, PUBLISHED BY C. G. NAUMANN (LEIPZIG, 1886),7 BUT HE HAS NOT. WHERE THE STANDARD EDITIONS DIFFER FROM THE ORIGINAL EDITION, HE FOLLOWS THE LATER EDITIONS.8 NO MATTER OF PHILOSOPHICAL SUBSTANCE IS INVOLVED; THE DEVIATIONS ARE VERY SMALL; BUT THE FACT REMAINS ASTONISHING. NOTWITHSTANDING ALL SORTS OF SENSATIONAL CLAIMS, NONE OF THE SCHOLARLY CORRECTIONS OF THE OLDER EDITIONS OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS WRITINGS, PUBLISHED SINCE WORLD WAR II, ARE IMPORTANT PHILOSOPHICALLY, AND IT IS IRONICAL THAT THE EDITIONS OF SCHLECHTA AND PODACH9 ARE BY NO MEANS MODELS OF BELATED PHILOLOGICAL SOUNDNESS.10 THIS TRANSLATION FOLLOWS THE FIRST EDITION. IN MY FOOTNOTE COMMENTARY, DEVIATIONS OF THE LATER EDITIONS ARE POINTED OUT.

I HAVE TAKEN TWO LIBERTIES. NIETZSCHE OCCASIONALLY USES DOTS, USUALLY FOUR, AS A PUNCTUATION MARK; FOR EXAMPLE, BUT BY NO MEANS THERE ALONE, AT THE END OF SECTIONS 62 AND 227. IN SERIOUS WORKS IN THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING WORLD DOTS ARE SO GENERALLY TAKEN TO INDICATE OMISSIONS THAT IT DID NOT SEEM ADVISABLE TO FOLLOW NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS USAGE. DASHES HAVE THEREFORE BEEN USED INSTEAD. MOREOVER, NIETZSCHE OFTEN EMPLOYS DOTS OR DASHES IN THE MIDDLE OF LENGTHY PARAGRAPHS. IN SUCH CASES I HAVE OFTEN BEGUN A NEW PARAGRAPH TO MARK THE BREAK; AND BEYOND THAT, I HAVE GENERALLY BROKEN UP LONG PARAGRAPHS. THE READER MAY ALWAYS ASSUME THAT IN THE ORIGINAL A NUMBERED SECTION CONSTITUTES A SINGLE PARAGRAPH; EVEN IF IT IS AS LONG AS THE WHOLE PREFACE OR SECTIONS 25, 26, AND 28.

BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL HAS BEEN TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH TWICE BEFORE. THE FIRST TRANSLATOR, HELEN ZIMMERN, WAS AN ENGLISH WRITER WHO HAD MET NIETZSCHE IN SILS MARIA IN THE SUMMER OF 1886‚ÄÎTHE PERIOD WHEN THE BOOK WAS COMPLETED, PRINTED, AND PUBLISHED. INDEED, NIETZSCHE MENTIONS HER IN THE MARGIN OF THE LETTER TO FRANZ OVERBECK PREVIOUSLY CITED: ‚ÄÚTILL THE MIDDLE OF SEPTEMBER I SHALL STAY HERE. THERE IS NO DEARTH OF OLD ACQUAINTANCES ‚Ä¶ MISS HELEN ZIMMERN ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

IN THE INDEX OF NAMES AT THE END OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS BRIEFE AN PETER GAST, HELEN ZIMMERN IS IDENTIFIED AS AN ‚ÄÚENGLISH WRITER;‚ÄÙ IN THE INDEX TO BRIEFE AN MUTTER UND SCHWESTER (LETTERS TO MOTHER AND SISTER, LEIPZIG, 1909), AS ‚ÄÚENGL. LITTERATIN,‚ÄÙ WHICH IS LESS RESPECTFUL. NEITHER VOLUME MENTIONS THAT SHE TRANSLATED BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL. WHAT NIETZSCHE WROTE (SEPTEMBER 19, 1886) ABOUT HER TO HIS MOTHER OR SISTER WAS: ‚ÄÚI HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF INTRODUCING THIS ‚ÄÒCHAMPION OF WOMEN‚ÄÔS RIGHTS‚ÄÔ (FRL. VON SALIS) TO ANOTHER ‚ÄÒCHAMPION‚ÄÔ WHO IS MY NEIGHBOR AT MEALS, MISS HELEN ZIMMERN, WHO IS EXTREMELY CLEVER, INCIDENTALLY NOT AN ENGLISHWOMAN‚ÄÎBUT JEWISH. MAY HEAVEN HAVE MERCY ON THE EUROPEAN INTELLECT IF ONE WANTED TO SUBTRACT THE JEWISH INTELLECT FROM IT.‚ÄÙ11 IN 1885, THE YEAR BEFORE, NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS SISTER HAD MARRIED BERNHARD F√∂RSTER, ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE GERMAN ANTI-SEMITIC MOVEMENT.12

HELEN ZIMMERN (1846‚ÄÌ1934), TWO YEARS NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS JUNIOR, HAD PUBLISHED ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER: HIS LIFE AND HIS PHILOSOPHY (1876) AND GOTTHOLD EPHRAIM LESSING: HIS LIFE AND HIS WORKS (1878); SHE ALSO PUBLISHED MANY OTHER BOOKS AND TRANSLATIONS, INCLUDING SEVERAL FROM THE ITALIAN. ABOUT HER VERSION OF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, DR. OSCAR LEVY REPORTED IN 1913 IN A SHORT ESSAY ON ‚ÄÚTHE NIETZSCHE MOVEMENT IN ENGLAND‚ÄÙ (IN THE LAST VOLUME, THE EIGHTEENTH, OF HIS EDITION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS): ‚ÄÚBUT IN 1907 THE PARTY HAD SOMEWHAT RECOVERED ITS SPIRIT, AND AS A LAST EXPERIMENT BROUGHT OUT A TRANSLATION OF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL‚ÄÎTHIS TIME AT PRIVATE RISK, FOR NO PUBLISHER COULD BE INDUCED TO TAKE UP AN AUTHOR TWICE REPUDIATED. THIS TRANSLATION WAS ONE WHICH HAD BEEN MADE NEARLY TEN YEARS AGO, BUT UNTIL THEN HAD NEVER SEEN, AND WAS NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE, THE LIGHT OF PUBLICITY. IT TURNED OUT TO BE A SUCCESS‚ÄÎA HALF-HEARTED SUCCESS PERHAPS, BUT ONE THAT AT LAST TOLD THE FEW INMATES OF THE NIETZSCHEAN ARK THAT THE WATERS OF DEMOCRACY HAD DIMINISHED, AND THAT AT LEAST SOME HIGHER PEAKS OF HUMANITY WERE FREE FROM THE APPALLING DELUGE. THE SUCCESS ENCOURAGED THEM ONCE MORE TO TAKE UP THEIR OLD PROJECT OF THE PUBLICATION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS‚Ä¶.‚ÄÙ

THE ‚ÄÚINMATES‚ÄÙ IN ENGLAND WERE A VERY DIFFERENT LOT FROM THOSE WHO WERE BY THEN WRITING ABOUT NIETZSCHE IN GERMANY AND FRANCE: ENGLISH PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHERS, FOR EXAMPLE, HAD DEVELOPED CURIOUS VERSIONS OF HEGELIANISM AFTER HEGEL HAD GONE INTO ECLIPSE ON THE CONTINENT, AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THE YOUNG G. E. MOORE AND BERTRAND RUSSELL WERE TRYING TO EMANCIPATE PHILOSOPHY FROM THE INFLUENCE OF THE LEADING IDEALISTS, F. H. BRADLEY AND J. M. E. MCTAGGART. THE TONE OF THE ENGLISH NIETZSCHEANS, IN TURN, HELPED TO CREATE A PUBLIC IMAGE OF NIETZSCHE THAT DID NOT ATTRACT PHILOSOPHERS TO HIM.

IT WAS OVER FIFTY YEARS AFTER BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL HAD ORIGINALLY APPEARED IN 1886 THAT PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHERS BEGAN TO PUBLISH STUDIES OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS PHILOSOPHY IN ENGLISH.

MEANWHILE, THE ZIMMERN TRANSLATION OF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL FOUND ITS WAY INTO THE MODERN LIBRARY, AND IT WAS UNTIL 1955 THE ONLY VERSION THROUGH WHICH MYRIADS OF READERS KNEW THE BOOK. IN PREPARING THE PRESENT EDITION, I HOPED AT FIRST THAT I MIGHT MERELY REVISE HER VERSION, MODERNIZING HER SOMEWHAT VICTORIAN PROSE AND CORRECTING MISTAKES; BUT I SOON GAVE UP. THE MISTAKES WERE TOO NUMEROUS, AND IN NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CASE NUANCES ARE SO IMPORTANT THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY AT WHAT POINT AN INFELICITOUS RENDERING BECOMES DOWNRIGHT WRONG.

THE SECOND TRANSLATOR, MARIANNE COWAN, IS NOT A PHILOSOPHER EITHER. HER VERSION IS MODERN AND VERY READABLE. BUT THE MERITS ARE SOMEWHAT OFFSET BY ERRORS OF UNDERSTANDING, AND THEREFORE I HAVE POINTED OUT A FEW SUCH INSTANCES IN MY NOTES.

OFTEN IT SEEMS HELPFUL TO CALL THE READER‚ÄÔS ATTENTION TO CRUCIAL PASSAGES IN SOME OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS OTHER WORKS. THESE ARE CITED IN EACH INSTANCE ACCORDING TO SECTIONS, TO ENABLE THE READER TO FIND THEM IN ANY EDITION; BUT IN THE CASE OF MATERIAL INCLUDED IN A VOLUME OF NIETZSCHE TRANSLATIONS THAT I PUBLISHED IN 195413 I HAVE ALSO GIVEN THE PAGE NUMBERS IN PARENTHESES.

ABOUT THE TITLE OF THE BOOK: LIKE MANY OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS TITLES, PHRASES, AND COINAGES, IT IS BRILLIANT, UNFORGETTABLE, AND USUALLY MISCONSTRUED. THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS OF THE BOOK ARE RELEVANT TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT NIETZSCHE MEANT BY ‚ÄÚBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL‚ÄÙ: THE AUTHOR‚ÄÔS PREFACE AND SECTIONS 2, 4, 32, 33, 56, 153, 164, 202, 212, THE END OF 241, 260, AND 284. THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE OTHER SECTIONS ARE NOT RELEVANT NOR THAT THE READER WOULD BE BEST ADVISED TO LOOK UP THESE PASSAGES FIRST. RATHER, IT WOULD BE WELL TO READ THE BOOK WITH AN OPEN MIND AND A READINESS TO DISTINGUISH THE MANY CONNOTATIONS OF ITS STRIKING TITLE. AND IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO READ THE EDITOR‚ÄÔS NOTE FOR SECTION 250 AT THE START.

TO AN EXTENT AT LEAST IT MAY HELP MANY READERS TO RELATE SEVERAL THEMES OF THE BOOK TO OTHER GREAT WRITERS, AND SOME SUCH COMPARISONS WILL BE FOUND IN THE NOTES. ONE THEME, HOWEVER, SHOULD BE STATED HERE AT THE OUTSET. IBSEN‚ÄÔS DR. THOMAS STOCKMANN SAYS AT THE END OF AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE: ‚ÄÚHE IS THE STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD THAT STANDS ALONE.‚ÄÙ THIS LEITMOTIF OF THE PLAY ILLUSTRATES KIERKEGAARD‚ÄÔS INFLUENCE ON IBSEN, TO WHICH GEORG BRANDES REFERRED IN A LETTER TO NIETZSCHE, MARCH 7, 1888: ‚ÄÚINTELLECTUALLY, HE HAS BEEN VERY DEPENDENT ON KIERKEGAARD.‚ÄÙ WE MAY RECALL KIERKEGAARD‚ÄÔS REMARKS ON ‚ÄÚTHAT INDIVIDUAL‚ÄÙ14 WITH ITS REFRAIN ‚ÄÚTHE CROWD IS UNTRUTH.‚ÄÙ THE FOURTH ACT OF IBSEN‚ÄÔS PLAY COULD ALMOST BE SUBTITLED ‚ÄÚVARIATIONS ON A THEME BY KIERKEGAARD.‚ÄÙ WITNESS DR. STOCKMANN‚ÄÔS WORDS:

THE MOST DANGEROUS ENEMY OF TRUTH AND FREEDOM AMONG US‚ÄÎIS THE COMPACT MAJORITY. YES, THE DAMNED, COMPACT, LIBERAL MAJORITY ‚Ä¶

THE MAJORITY HAS MIGHT‚ÄÎUNFORTUNATELY‚ÄÎBUT RIGHT IT IS NOT. RIGHT‚ÄÎARE I AND A FEW OTHERS. THE MINORITY IS ALWAYS RIGHT‚Ä¶.

I HAVE A MIND TO MAKE A REVOLUTION AGAINST THE LIE THAT THE MAJORITY IS IN THE POSSESSION OF TRUTH. WHAT KIND OF TRUTHS ARE THOSE AROUND WHICH THE MAJORITY USUALLY GATHERS? THEY ARE TRUTHS THAT HAVE BECOME SO OLD THAT THEY ARE ON THE WAY TOWARD BECOMING SHAKY. BUT ONCE A TRUTH HAS BECOME THAT OLD, IT IS ALSO ON THE WAY TOWARD BECOMING A LIE ‚Ä¶ A NORMALLY CONSTITUTED TRUTH LIVES, LET US SAY, AS A RULE SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN YEARS; AT MOST TWENTY, RARELY MORE. BUT SUCH AGED TRUTHS ARE ALWAYS EXCEEDINGLY THIN. NEVERTHELESS IT IS ONLY AT THAT STAGE THAT THE MAJORITY MAKES THEIR ACQUAINTANCE ‚Ä¶ ALL THESE MAJORITY TRUTHS ‚Ä¶ ARE RATHER LIKE RANCID, SPOILED ‚Ä¶ HAMS. AND THAT IS THE SOURCE OF THE MORAL SCURVY THAT RAGES ALL AROUND US‚Ä¶.‚ÄÙ



A GENERATION LATER, FREUD SAID ON THE SECOND PAGE OF HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SELBSTDARSTELLUNG (LEIPZIG, 1925) THAT, AS A JEW AT AN ANTI-SEMITIC UNIVERSITY, ‚ÄÚI LEARNED EARLY TO KNOW THE LOT OF STANDING IN OPPOSITION AND BEING PLACED UNDER A BAN BY THE ‚ÄÒCOMPACT MAJORITY.‚ÄÔ THUS THE GROUND WAS LAID FOR A CERTAIN INDEPENDENCE OF JUDGMENT.‚ÄÙ

ONE REASONABLE PERSPECTIVE FOR BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL IS TO SEE IT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN KIERKEGAARD AND IBSEN ON THE ONE HAND AND FREUD AND SARTRE ON THE OTHER. AND CONSIDERING HOW MUCH NIETZSCHE HAS TO SAY ABOUT ‚ÄÚNOBILITY‚ÄÙ IN THIS BOOK, IT IS GOOD TO RECALL THAT THE OLD FREUD SAID IN A LETTER ABOUT NIETZSCHE: ‚ÄÚIN MY YOUTH HE SIGNIFIED A NOBILITY WHICH I COULD NOT ATTAIN.‚ÄÙ15

SUCH SECTIONS AS 212 AND 296, TO NAME ONLY TWO AMONG A GREAT MANY, INVITE COMPARISON WITH SOME OF THE PHRASES CITED HERE. BUT IT WOULD BE POINTLESS TO ATTEMPT A LONG LIST, FOR WHAT IS AT STAKE IS NOT JUST A VERBAL SIMILARITY HERE OR THERE BUT RATHER ONE WAY OF SEEING THE WHOLE BOOK. THERE ARE MANY OTHERS.

IT WOULD BE FOOLISH FOR A TRANSLATOR, AND EVEN FOR A COMMENTATOR, TO ATTEMPT TO FOIST HIS OWN ESTIMATE OF A BOOK WITH WHICH HE HAS BEEN LIVING FOR SOME TIME ON THOSE WHO WILL HENCEFORTH SHARE HIS EXPERIENCE TO SOME EXTENT. BUT IN THE SPIRIT OF ZARATHUSTRA‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚTHIS IS MY WAY; WHERE IS YOURS?‚ÄÙ16 I SHALL VENTURE A SUGGESTION.

THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT BOOKS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, INDEED OF ANY CENTURY, DESPITE MUCH WITH WHICH THE MODERN READER MIGHT DISAGREE. THERE IS MUCH IN IT WITH WHICH I TOO DO NOT AGREE; BUT THAT IS ALSO TRUE OF PLATO‚ÄÔS AND ARISTOTLE‚ÄÔS WRITINGS, OF ALL GREAT PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS AND, MAKING DUE ALLOWANCES FOR THE DIFFERENT GENRE, OF DANTE‚ÄÔS AND DOSTOEVSKY‚ÄÔS IDEAS AND OF THE BIBLE. THERE ARE SOME PASSAGES THAT STRIKE ME AS BLEMISHES WITHOUT WHICH THE BOOK WOULD BE BETTER; FOR EXAMPLE, THE TEDIOUS REMARKS ABOUT WOMEN, THE MERCIFULLY BRIEFER COMMENTS ON THE ENGLISH, AND THE POEM AT THE END.

IT IS POSSIBLE TO SAY BRIEFLY WHAT MAKES THE BOOK GREAT: THE PROPHETIC INDEPENDENCE OF ITS SPIRIT; THE HUNDREDS OF DOORS IT OPENS FOR THE MIND, REVEALING NEW VISTAS, PROBLEMS, AND RELATIONSHIPS; AND WHAT IT CONTRIBUTES TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF MUCH OF RECENT THOUGHT AND LITERATURE AND HISTORY. READERS MIGHT ASK, FOR EXAMPLE, ABOUT THE RELATION OF VARIOUS PASSAGES TO PSYCHOANALYSIS, TO ANALYTICAL PHILOSOPHY, OR TO EXISTENTIALISM. BUT EVEN A FAR LONGER LIST WOULD NOT DO JUSTICE TO THE BOOK. THERE REMAINS ANOTHER DIMENSION. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE BOOKS IN WHICH ONE ENCOUNTERS NOT ONLY A GREAT THINKER BUT ALSO A FASCINATING HUMAN BEING OF EXCEPTIONAL COMPLEXITY AND INTEGRITY.

ONE FINAL CAUTION. BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL IS NOT A COLLECTION OF APHORISMS FOR BROWSING. EACH OF THE NINE MAJOR PARTS, WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF PART FOUR, IS MEANT TO BE READ STRAIGHT THROUGH. EACH PURSUES ONE COMPLEX OF PROBLEMS, AND WHAT IS SAID IN ONE SECTION IS FREQUENTLY QUALIFIED DECISIVELY IN THE NEXT, OR A FEW PAGES LATER. THE OFTEN SURPRISING DEVELOPMENTS OF AN IDEA CONSTITUTE ONE OF THE MAJOR CHARMS OF THIS WORK. AND IT IS IN PART ON THEIR ACCOUNT THAT THIS BOOK, LIKE ALL GREAT BOOKS‚ÄÎFOR THIS IS PART OF THEIR DEFINITION OR, AS NIETZSCHE MIGHT SAY, A CRITERION FOR THE ORDER OF RANK‚ÄÎNEEDS TO BE READ MORE THAN ONCE. IT IS A BOOK TO REREAD AND LIVE WITH.

PREFACE


SUPPOSING TRUTH IS A WOMAN‚ÄÎWHAT THEN? ARE THERE NOT GROUNDS FOR THE SUSPICION THAT ALL PHILOSOPHERS, INSOFAR AS THEY WERE DOGMATISTS, HAVE BEEN VERY INEXPERT ABOUT WOMEN? THAT THE GRUESOME SERIOUSNESS, THE CLUMSY OBTRUSIVENESS WITH WHICH THEY HAVE USUALLY APPROACHED TRUTH SO FAR1 HAVE BEEN AWKWARD AND VERY IMPROPER METHODS FOR WINNING A WOMAN‚ÄÔS HEART? WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT SHE HAS NOT ALLOWED HERSELF TO BE WON‚ÄÎAND TODAY EVERY KIND OF DOGMATISM IS LEFT STANDING DISPIRITED AND DISCOURAGED. IF IT IS LEFT STANDING AT ALL! FOR THERE ARE SCOFFERS WHO CLAIM THAT IT HAS FALLEN, THAT ALL DOGMATISM LIES ON THE GROUND‚ÄÎEVEN MORE, THAT ALL DOGMATISM IS DYING.

SPEAKING SERIOUSLY, THERE ARE GOOD REASONS WHY ALL PHILOSOPHICAL DOGMATIZING, HOWEVER SOLEMN AND DEFINITIVE ITS AIRS USED TO BE, MAY NEVERTHELESS HAVE BEEN NO MORE THAN A NOBLE CHILDISHNESS AND TYRONISM. AND PERHAPS THE TIME IS AT HAND WHEN IT WILL BE COMPREHENDED AGAIN AND AGAIN HOW LITTLE USED TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FURNISH THE CORNERSTONE FOR SUCH SUBLIME AND UNCONDITIONAL PHILOSOPHERS‚ÄÔ EDIFICES AS THE DOGMATISTS HAVE BUILT SO FAR: ANY OLD POPULAR SUPERSTITION FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL (LIKE THE SOUL SUPERSTITION WHICH, IN THE FORM OF THE SUBJECT AND EGO SUPERSTITION, HAS NOT EVEN YET CEASED TO DO MISCHIEF); SOME PLAY ON WORDS PERHAPS, A SEDUCTION BY GRAMMAR, OR AN AUDACIOUS GENERALIZATION OF VERY NARROW, VERY PERSONAL, VERY HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMAN FACTS.

THE DOGMATISTS‚ÄÔ PHILOSOPHY WAS, LET US HOPE, ONLY A PROMISE ACROSS MILLENNIA‚ÄÎAS ASTROLOGY WAS IN STILL EARLIER TIMES WHEN PERHAPS MORE WORK, MONEY, ACUTENESS, AND PATIENCE WERE LAVISHED IN ITS SERVICE THAN FOR ANY REAL SCIENCE SO FAR: TO ASTROLOGY AND ITS ‚ÄÚSUPRA-TERRESTRIAL‚ÄÙ CLAIMS WE OWE THE GRAND STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE IN ASIA AND EGYPT. IT SEEMS THAT ALL GREAT THINGS FIRST HAVE TO BESTRIDE THE EARTH IN MONSTROUS AND FRIGHTENING MASKS IN ORDER TO INSCRIBE THEMSELVES IN THE HEARTS OF HUMANITY WITH ETERNAL DEMANDS: DOGMATIC PHILOSOPHY WAS SUCH A MASK; FOR EXAMPLE, THE VEDANTA DOCTRINE IN ASIA AND PLATONISM IN EUROPE.

LET US NOT BE UNGRATEFUL TO IT, ALTHOUGH IT MUST CERTAINLY BE CONCEDED THAT THE WORST, MOST DURABLE, AND MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL ERRORS SO FAR WAS A DOGMATIST‚ÄÔS ERROR‚ÄÎNAMELY, PLATO‚ÄÔS INVENTION OF THE PURE SPIRIT AND THE GOOD AS SUCH. BUT NOW THAT IT IS OVERCOME, NOW THAT EUROPE IS BREATHING FREELY AGAIN AFTER THIS NIGHTMARE AND AT LEAST CAN ENJOY A HEALTHIER‚ÄÎSLEEP, WE, WHOSE TASK IS WAKEFULNESS ITSELF, ARE THE HEIRS OF ALL THAT STRENGTH WHICH HAS BEEN FOSTERED2 BY THE FIGHT AGAINST THIS ERROR. TO BE SURE, IT MEANT STANDING TRUTH ON HER HEAD AND DENYING PERSPECTIVE, THE BASIC CONDITION OF ALL LIFE, WHEN ONE SPOKE OF SPIRIT AND THE GOOD AS PLATO DID. INDEED, AS A PHYSICIAN ONE MIGHT ASK: ‚ÄÚHOW COULD THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GROWTH OF ANTIQUITY, PLATO, CONTRACT SUCH A DISEASE? DID THE WICKED SOCRATES CORRUPT HIM AFTER ALL? COULD SOCRATES HAVE BEEN THE CORRUPTER OF YOUTH AFTER ALL? AND DID HE DESERVE HIS HEMLOCK?‚ÄÙ

BUT THE FIGHT AGAINST PLATO OR, TO SPEAK MORE CLEARLY AND FOR ‚ÄÚTHE PEOPLE,‚ÄÙ THE FIGHT AGAINST THE CHRISTIAN-ECCLESIASTICAL PRESSURE OF MILLENNIA‚ÄÎFOR CHRISTIANITY IS PLATONISM FOR ‚ÄÚTHE PEOPLE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHAS CREATED IN EUROPE A MAGNIFICENT TENSION OF THE SPIRIT THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NEVER YET EXISTED ON EARTH: WITH SO TENSE A BOW WE CAN NOW SHOOT FOR THE MOST DISTANT GOALS. TO BE SURE, EUROPEAN MAN EXPERIENCES THIS TENSION AS NEED AND DISTRESS; TWICE ALREADY ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE GRAND STYLE TO UNBEND THE BOW‚ÄÎONCE BY MEANS OF JESUITISM, THE SECOND TIME BY MEANS OF THE DEMOCRATIC ENLIGHTENMENT WHICH, WITH THE AID OF FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND NEWSPAPER-READING, MIGHT INDEED BRING IT ABOUT THAT THE SPIRIT WOULD NO LONGER EXPERIENCE ITSELF SO EASILY AS A ‚ÄÚNEED.‚ÄÙ (THE GERMANS HAVE INVENTED GUNPOWDER‚ÄÎALL DUE RESPECT FOR THAT!‚ÄÎBUT THEN THEY MADE UP FOR THAT: THEY INVENTED THE PRESS.)3 BUT WE WHO ARE NEITHER JESUITS NOR DEMOCRATS, NOR EVEN GERMAN ENOUGH, WE GOOD EUROPEANS4 AND FREE, VERY FREE SPIRITS‚ÄÎWE STILL FEEL IT, THE WHOLE NEED OF THE SPIRIT AND THE WHOLE TENSION OF ITS BOW. AND PERHAPS ALSO THE ARROW, THE TASK, AND‚ÄÎWHO KNOWS?‚ÄÎTHE GOAL‚ÄÎ

THE WILL TO TRUTH WHICH WILL STILL TEMPT US TO MANY A VENTURE, THAT FAMOUS TRUTHFULNESS OF WHICH ALL PHILOSOPHERS SO FAR HAVE SPOKEN WITH RESPECT‚ÄÎWHAT QUESTIONS HAS THIS WILL TO TRUTH NOT LAID BEFORE US! WHAT STRANGE, WICKED, QUESTIONABLE QUESTIONS! THAT IS A LONG STORY EVEN NOW‚ÄÎAND YET IT SEEMS AS IF IT HAD SCARCELY BEGUN. IS IT ANY WONDER THAT WE SHOULD FINALLY BECOME SUSPICIOUS, LOSE PATIENCE, AND TURN AWAY IMPATIENTLY? THAT WE SHOULD FINALLY LEARN FROM THIS SPHINX TO ASK QUESTIONS, TOO? WHO IS IT REALLY THAT PUTS QUESTIONS TO US HERE? WHAT IN US REALLY WANTS ‚ÄÚTRUTH‚ÄÙ?

INDEED WE CAME TO A LONG HALT AT THE QUESTION ABOUT THE CAUSE OF THIS WILL‚ÄÎUNTIL WE FINALLY CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP BEFORE A STILL MORE BASIC QUESTION. WE ASKED ABOUT THE VALUE OF THIS WILL. SUPPOSE WE WANT TRUTH: WHY NOT RATHER UNTRUTH? AND UNCERTAINTY? EVEN IGNORANCE?

THE PROBLEM OF THE VALUE OF TRUTH CAME BEFORE US‚ÄÎOR WAS IT WE WHO CAME BEFORE THE PROBLEM? WHO OF US IS OEDIPUS HERE? WHO THE SPHINX? IT IS A RENDEZVOUS, IT SEEMS, OF QUESTIONS AND QUESTION MARKS.

AND THOUGH IT SCARCELY SEEMS CREDIBLE, IT FINALLY ALMOST SEEMS TO US AS IF THE PROBLEM HAD NEVER EVEN BEEN PUT SO FAR‚ÄÎAS IF WE WERE THE FIRST TO SEE IT, FIX IT WITH OUR EYES, AND RISK IT. FOR IT DOES INVOLVE A RISK, AND PERHAPS THERE IS NONE THAT IS GREATER.

‚ÄÚHOW COULD ANYTHING ORIGINATE OUT OF ITS OPPOSITE? FOR EXAMPLE, TRUTH OUT OF ERROR? OR THE WILL TO TRUTH OUT OF THE WILL TO DECEPTION? OR SELFLESS DEEDS OUT OF SELFISHNESS? OR THE PURE AND SUNLIKE GAZE OF THE SAGE OUT OF LUST? SUCH ORIGINS ARE IMPOSSIBLE; WHOEVER DREAMS OF THEM IS A FOOL, INDEED WORSE; THE THINGS OF THE HIGHEST VALUE MUST HAVE ANOTHER, PECULIAR ORIGIN‚ÄÎTHEY CANNOT BE DERIVED FROM THIS TRANSITORY, SEDUCTIVE, DECEPTIVE, PALTRY WORLD, FROM THIS TURMOIL OF DELUSION AND LUST. RATHER FROM THE LAP OF BEING, THE INTRANSITORY, THE HIDDEN GOD, THE ‚ÄÒTHING-IN-ITSELF‚ÄÔ‚ÄÎTHERE MUST BE THEIR BASIS, AND NOWHERE ELSE.‚ÄÙ

THIS WAY OF JUDGING CONSTITUTES THE TYPICAL PREJUDGMENT AND PREJUDICE WHICH GIVE AWAY THE METAPHYSICIANS OF ALL AGES; THIS KIND OF VALUATION LOOMS IN THE BACKGROUND OF ALL THEIR LOGICAL PROCEDURES; IT IS ON ACCOUNT OF THIS ‚ÄÚFAITH‚ÄÙ THAT THEY TROUBLE THEMSELVES ABOUT ‚ÄÚKNOWLEDGE,‚ÄÙ ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS FINALLY BAPTIZED SOLEMNLY AS ‚ÄÚTHE TRUTH.‚ÄÙ THE FUNDAMENTAL FAITH OF THE METAPHYSICIANS IS THE FAITH IN OPPOSITE VALUES.2 IT HAS NOT EVEN OCCURRED TO THE MOST CAUTIOUS AMONG THEM THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE A DOUBT RIGHT HERE AT THE THRESHOLD WHERE IT WAS SURELY MOST NECESSARY‚ÄÎEVEN IF THEY VOWED TO THEMSELVES, ‚ÄÚDE OMNIBUS DUBITANDUM.‚ÄÙ3

FOR ONE MAY DOUBT, FIRST, WHETHER THERE ARE ANY OPPOSITES AT ALL, AND SECONDLY WHETHER THESE POPULAR VALUATIONS AND OPPOSITE VALUES ON WHICH THE METAPHYSICIANS PUT THEIR SEAL, ARE NOT PERHAPS MERELY FOREGROUND ESTIMATES, ONLY PROVISIONAL PERSPECTIVES, PERHAPS EVEN FROM SOME NOOK, PERHAPS FROM BELOW, FROG PERSPECTIVES, AS IT WERE, TO BORROW AN EXPRESSION PAINTERS USE. FOR ALL THE VALUE THAT THE TRUE, THE TRUTHFUL, THE SELFLESS MAY DESERVE, IT WOULD STILL BE POSSIBLE THAT A HIGHER AND MORE FUNDAMENTAL VALUE FOR LIFE MIGHT HAVE TO BE ASCRIBED TO DECEPTION, SELFISHNESS, AND LUST. IT MIGHT EVEN BE POSSIBLE THAT WHAT CONSTITUTES THE VALUE OF THESE GOOD AND REVERED THINGS IS PRECISELY THAT THEY ARE INSIDIOUSLY RELATED, TIED TO, AND INVOLVED WITH THESE WICKED, SEEMINGLY OPPOSITE THINGS‚ÄÎMAYBE EVEN ONE WITH THEM IN ESSENCE. MAYBE!

BUT WHO HAS THE WILL TO CONCERN HIMSELF WITH SUCH DANGEROUS MAYBES? FOR THAT, ONE REALLY HAS TO WAIT FOR THE ADVENT OF A NEW SPECIES OF PHILOSOPHERS, SUCH AS HAVE SOMEHOW ANOTHER AND CONVERSE TASTE AND PROPENSITY FROM THOSE WE HAVE KNOWN SO FAR‚ÄÎPHILOSOPHERS OF THE DANGEROUS ‚ÄÚMAYBE‚ÄÙ IN EVERY SENSE.

AND IN ALL SERIOUSNESS: I SEE SUCH NEW PHILOSOPHERS COMING UP.

AFTER HAVING LOOKED LONG ENOUGH BETWEEN THE PHILOSOPHER‚ÄÔS LINES AND FINGERS, I SAY TO MYSELF: BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF CONSCIOUS THINKING MUST STILL BE INCLUDED AMONG INSTINCTIVE ACTIVITIES, AND THAT GOES EVEN FOR PHILOSOPHICAL THINKING. WE HAVE TO RELEARN HERE, AS ONE HAS HAD TO RELEARN ABOUT HEREDITY AND WHAT IS ‚ÄÚINNATE.‚ÄÙ AS THE ACT OF BIRTH DESERVES NO CONSIDERATION IN THE WHOLE PROCESS AND PROCEDURE OF HEREDITY, SO ‚ÄÚBEING CONSCIOUS‚ÄÙ IS NOT IN ANY DECISIVE SENSE THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS INSTINCTIVE: MOST OF THE CONSCIOUS THINKING OF A PHILOSOPHER IS SECRETLY GUIDED AND FORCED INTO CERTAIN CHANNELS BY HIS INSTINCTS.

BEHIND ALL LOGIC AND ITS SEEMING SOVEREIGNTY OF MOVEMENT, TOO, THERE STAND VALUATIONS OR, MORE CLEARLY, PHYSIOLOGICAL DEMANDS FOR THE PRESERVATION OF A CERTAIN TYPE OF LIFE. FOR EXAMPLE, THAT THE DEFINITE SHOULD BE WORTH MORE THAN THE INDEFINITE, AND MERE APPEARANCE WORTH LESS THAN ‚ÄÚTRUTH‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎSUCH ESTIMATES MIGHT BE, IN SPITE OF THEIR REGULATIVE IMPORTANCE FOR US, NEVERTHELESS MERE FOREGROUND ESTIMATES, A CERTAIN KIND OF NIAISERIE4 WHICH MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF JUST SUCH BEINGS AS WE ARE. SUPPOSING, THAT IS, THAT NOT JUST MAN IS THE ‚ÄÚMEASURE OF THINGS‚ÄÙ5‚ÄÎ

THE FALSENESS OF A JUDGMENT IS FOR US NOT NECESSARILY AN OBJECTION TO A JUDGMENT; IN THIS RESPECT OUR NEW LANGUAGE MAY SOUND STRANGEST. THE QUESTION IS TO WHAT EXTENT IT IS LIFE-PROMOTING, LIFE-PRESERVING, SPECIES-PRESERVING, PERHAPS EVEN SPECIES-CULTIVATING. AND WE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY INCLINED TO CLAIM THAT THE FALSEST JUDGMENTS (WHICH INCLUDE THE SYNTHETIC JUDGMENTS A PRIORI)6 ARE THE MOST INDISPENSABLE FOR US; THAT WITHOUT ACCEPTING THE FICTIONS OF LOGIC, WITHOUT MEASURING REALITY AGAINST THE PURELY INVENTED WORLD OF THE UNCONDITIONAL AND SELF-IDENTICAL, WITHOUT A CONSTANT FALSIFICATION OF THE WORLD BY MEANS OF NUMBERS, MAN COULD NOT LIVE‚ÄÎTHAT RENOUNCING FALSE JUDGMENTS WOULD MEAN RENOUNCING LIFE AND A DENIAL OF LIFE. TO RECOGNIZE UNTRUTH AS A CONDITION OF LIFE‚ÄÎTHAT CERTAINLY MEANS RESISTING ACCUSTOMED VALUE FEELINGS IN A DANGEROUS WAY; AND A PHILOSOPHY THAT RISKS THIS WOULD BY THAT TOKEN ALONE PLACE ITSELF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL.

WHAT PROVOKES ONE TO LOOK AT ALL PHILOSOPHERS HALF SUSPICIOUSLY, HALF MOCKINGLY, IS NOT THAT ONE DISCOVERS AGAIN AND AGAIN HOW INNOCENT THEY ARE‚ÄÎHOW OFTEN AND HOW EASILY THEY MAKE MISTAKES AND GO ASTRAY; IN SHORT, THEIR CHILDISHNESS AND CHILDLIKENESS‚ÄÎBUT THAT THEY ARE NOT HONEST ENOUGH IN THEIR WORK, ALTHOUGH THEY ALL MAKE A LOT OF VIRTUOUS NOISE WHEN THE PROBLEM OF TRUTHFULNESS IS TOUCHED EVEN REMOTELY. THEY ALL POSE AS IF THEY HAD DISCOVERED AND REACHED THEIR REAL OPINIONS THROUGH THE SELF-DEVELOPMENT OF A COLD, PURE, DIVINELY UNCONCERNED DIALECTIC (AS OPPOSED TO THE MYSTICS OF EVERY RANK, WHO ARE MORE HONEST AND DOLTISH‚ÄÎAND TALK OF ‚ÄÚINSPIRATION‚ÄÙ); WHILE AT BOTTOM IT IS AN ASSUMPTION, A HUNCH, INDEED A KIND OF ‚ÄÚINSPIRATION‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎMOST OFTEN A DESIRE OF THE HEART THAT HAS BEEN FILTERED AND MADE ABSTRACT‚ÄÎTHAT THEY DEFEND WITH REASONS THEY HAVE SOUGHT AFTER THE FACT. THEY ARE ALL ADVOCATES WHO RESENT THAT NAME, AND FOR THE MOST PART EVEN WILY SPOKESMEN FOR THEIR PREJUDICES WHICH THEY BAPTIZE ‚ÄÚTRUTHS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND VERY FAR FROM HAVING THE COURAGE OF THE CONSCIENCE THAT ADMITS THIS, PRECISELY THIS, TO ITSELF; VERY FAR FROM HAVING THE GOOD TASTE OF THE COURAGE WHICH ALSO LETS THIS BE KNOWN, WHETHER TO WARN AN ENEMY OR FRIEND, OR, FROM EXUBERANCE, TO MOCK ITSELF.

THE EQUALLY STIFF AND DECOROUS TARTUFFERY OF THE OLD KANT AS HE LURES US ON THE DIALECTICAL BYPATHS THAT LEAD TO HIS ‚ÄÚCATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎREALLY LEAD ASTRAY AND SEDUCE‚ÄÎTHIS SPECTACLE MAKES US SMILE, AS WE ARE FASTIDIOUS AND FIND IT QUITE AMUSING TO WATCH CLOSELY THE SUBTLE TRICKS OF OLD MORALISTS AND PREACHERS OF MORALS. OR CONSIDER THE HOCUS-POCUS OF MATHEMATICAL FORM WITH WHICH SPINOZA CLAD HIS PHILOSOPHY‚ÄÎREALLY ‚ÄÚTHE LOVE OF HIS WISDOM,‚ÄÙ TO RENDER THAT WORD FAIRLY AND SQUARELY‚ÄÎIN MAIL AND MASK, TO STRIKE TERROR AT THE VERY OUTSET INTO THE HEART OF ANY ASSAILANT WHO SHOULD DARE TO GLANCE AT THAT INVINCIBLE MAIDEN AND PALLAS ATHENA: HOW MUCH PERSONAL TIMIDITY AND VULNERABILITY THIS MASQUERADE OF A SICK HERMIT BETRAYS!





6


GRADUALLY IT HAS BECOME CLEAR TO ME WHAT EVERY GREAT PHILOSOPHY SO FAR HAS BEEN: NAMELY, THE PERSONAL CONFESSION OF ITS AUTHOR AND A KIND OF INVOLUNTARY AND UNCONSCIOUS MEMOIR; ALSO THAT THE MORAL (OR IMMORAL) INTENTIONS IN EVERY PHILOSOPHY CONSTITUTED THE REAL GERM OF LIFE FROM WHICH THE WHOLE PLANT HAD GROWN.

INDEED, IF ONE WOULD EXPLAIN HOW THE ABSTRUSEST METAPHYSICAL CLAIMS OF A PHILOSOPHER REALLY CAME ABOUT, IT IS ALWAYS WELL (AND WISE) TO ASK FIRST: AT WHAT MORALITY DOES ALL THIS (DOES HE) AIM? ACCORDINGLY, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A ‚ÄÚDRIVE TO KNOWLEDGE‚ÄÙ IS THE FATHER OF PHILOSOPHY; BUT RATHER THAT ANOTHER DRIVE HAS, HERE AS ELSEWHERE, EMPLOYED UNDERSTANDING (AND MISUNDERSTANDING) AS A MERE INSTRUMENT. BUT ANYONE WHO CONSIDERS THE BASIC DRIVES OF MAN TO SEE TO WHAT EXTENT THEY MAY HAVE BEEN AT PLAY JUST HERE AS INSPIRING SPIRITS (OR DEMONS AND KOBOLDS) WILL FIND THAT ALL OF THEM HAVE DONE PHILOSOPHY AT SOME TIME‚ÄÎAND THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WOULD LIKE ONLY TOO WELL TO REPRESENT JUST ITSELF AS THE ULTIMATE PURPOSE OF EXISTENCE AND THE LEGITIMATE MASTER OF ALL THE OTHER DRIVES. FOR EVERY DRIVE WANTS TO BE MASTER‚ÄÎAND IT ATTEMPTS TO PHILOSOPHIZE IN THAT SPIRIT.

TO BE SURE: AMONG SCHOLARS WHO ARE REALLY SCIENTIFIC MEN, THINGS MAY BE DIFFERENT‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚBETTER,‚ÄÙ IF YOU LIKE‚ÄÎTHERE YOU MAY REALLY FIND SOMETHING LIKE A DRIVE FOR KNOWLEDGE, SOME SMALL, INDEPENDENT CLOCKWORK THAT, ONCE WELL WOUND, WORKS ON VIGOROUSLY WITHOUT ANY ESSENTIAL PARTICIPATION FROM ALL THE OTHER DRIVES OF THE SCHOLAR. THE REAL ‚ÄÚINTERESTS‚ÄÙ OF THE SCHOLAR THEREFORE LIE USUALLY SOMEWHERE ELSE‚ÄÎSAY, IN HIS FAMILY, OR IN MAKING MONEY, OR IN POLITICS. INDEED, IT IS ALMOST A MATTER OF TOTAL INDIFFERENCE WHETHER HIS LITTLE MACHINE IS PLACED AT THIS OR THAT SPOT IN SCIENCE, AND WHETHER THE ‚ÄÚPROMISING‚ÄÙ YOUNG WORKER TURNS HIMSELF INTO A GOOD PHILOLOGIST OR AN EXPERT ON FUNGI OR A CHEMIST: IT DOES NOT CHARACTERIZE HIM THAT HE BECOMES THIS OR THAT. IN THE PHILOSOPHER, CONVERSELY, THERE IS NOTHING WHATEVER THAT IS IMPERSONAL;7 AND ABOVE ALL, HIS MORALITY BEARS DECIDED AND DECISIVE WITNESS TO WHO HE IS‚ÄÎTHAT IS, IN WHAT ORDER OF RANK THE INNERMOST DRIVES OF HIS NATURE STAND IN RELATION TO EACH OTHER.

HOW MALICIOUS PHILOSOPHERS CAN BE! I KNOW OF NOTHING MORE VENOMOUS THAN THE JOKE EPICURUS PERMITTED HIMSELF AGAINST PLATO AND THE PLATONISTS; HE CALLED THEM DIONYSIOKOLAKES. THAT MEANS LITERALLY‚ÄÎAND THIS IS THE FOREGROUND MEANING‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚFLATTERERS OF DIONYSIUS,‚ÄÙ IN OTHER WORDS, TYRANT‚ÄÔS BAGGAGE AND LICKSPITTLES; BUT IN ADDITION TO THIS HE ALSO WANTS TO SAY, ‚ÄÚTHEY ARE ALL ACTORS, THERE IS NOTHING GENUINE ABOUT THEM‚ÄÙ (FOR DIONYSOKOLAX WAS A POPULAR NAME FOR AN ACTOR).8 AND THE LATTER IS REALLY THE MALICE THAT EPICURUS AIMED AT PLATO: HE WAS PEEVED BY THE GRANDIOSE MANNER, THE MISE EN SC√®NE9 AT WHICH PLATO AND HIS DISCIPLES WERE SO EXPERT‚ÄÎAT WHICH EPICURUS WAS NOT AN EXPERT‚ÄÎHE, THAT OLD SCHOOLMASTER FROM SAMOS, WHO SAT, HIDDEN AWAY, IN HIS LITTLE GARDEN AT ATHENS AND WROTE THREE HUNDRED BOOKS‚ÄÎWHO KNOWS? PERHAPS FROM RAGE AND AMBITION AGAINST PLATO?

IT TOOK A HUNDRED YEARS UNTIL GREECE FOUND OUT WHO THIS GARDEN GOD, EPICURUS, HAD BEEN.‚ÄÎDID THEY FIND OUT?‚ÄÎ





8


THERE IS A POINT IN EVERY PHILOSOPHY WHEN THE PHILOSOPHER‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚCONVICTION‚ÄÙ APPEARS ON THE STAGE‚ÄÎOR TO USE THE LANGUAGE OF AN ANCIENT MYSTERY:

ADVENTAVIT ASINUS,

PULCHER ET FORTISSIMUS.10

‚ÄÚACCORDING TO NATURE‚ÄÙ YOU WANT TO LIVE? O YOU NOBLE STOICS, WHAT DECEPTIVE WORDS THESE ARE! IMAGINE A BEING LIKE NATURE, WASTEFUL BEYOND MEASURE, INDIFFERENT BEYOND MEASURE, WITHOUT PURPOSES AND CONSIDERATION, WITHOUT MERCY AND JUSTICE, FERTILE AND DESOLATE AND UNCERTAIN AT THE SAME TIME; IMAGINE INDIFFERENCE ITSELF AS A POWER‚ÄÎHOW COULD YOU LIVE ACCORDING TO THIS INDIFFERENCE? LIVING‚ÄÎIS THAT NOT PRECISELY WANTING TO BE OTHER THAN THIS NATURE? IS NOT LIVING‚ÄÎESTIMATING, PREFERRING, BEING UNJUST, BEING LIMITED, WANTING TO BE DIFFERENT? AND SUPPOSING YOUR IMPERATIVE ‚ÄÚLIVE ACCORDING TO NATURE‚ÄÙ MEANT AT BOTTOM AS MUCH AS ‚ÄÚLIVE ACCORDING TO LIFE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHOW COULD YOU NOT DO THAT? WHY MAKE A PRINCIPLE OF WHAT YOU YOURSELVES ARE AND MUST BE?

IN TRUTH, THE MATTER IS ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT: WHILE YOU PRETEND RAPTUROUSLY TO READ THE CANON OF YOUR LAW IN NATURE, YOU WANT SOMETHING OPPOSITE, YOU STRANGE ACTORS AND SELF-DECEIVERS! YOUR PRIDE WANTS TO IMPOSE YOUR MORALITY, YOUR IDEAL, ON NATURE‚ÄÎEVEN ON NATURE‚ÄÎAND INCORPORATE THEM IN HER; YOU DEMAND THAT SHE SHOULD BE NATURE ‚ÄÚACCORDING TO THE STOA,‚ÄÙ AND YOU WOULD LIKE ALL EXISTENCE TO EXIST ONLY AFTER YOUR OWN IMAGE‚ÄÎAS AN IMMENSE ETERNAL GLORIFICATION AND GENERALIZATION OF STOICISM. FOR ALL YOUR LOVE OF TRUTH, YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELVES SO LONG, SO PERSISTENTLY, SO RIGIDLY-HYPNOTICALLY TO SEE NATURE THE WRONG WAY, NAMELY STOICALLY, THAT YOU ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO SEE HER DIFFERENTLY. AND SOME ABYSMAL ARROGANCE FINALLY STILL INSPIRES YOU WITH THE INSANE HOPE THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW TO TYRANNIZE YOURSELVES‚ÄÎSTOICISM IS SELF-TYRANNY‚ÄÎNATURE, TOO, LETS HERSELF BE TYRANNIZED: IS NOT THE STOIC‚ÄÎA PIECE OF NATURE?

BUT THIS IS AN ANCIENT, ETERNAL STORY: WHAT FORMERLY HAPPENED WITH THE STOICS STILL HAPPENS TODAY, TOO, AS SOON AS ANY PHILOSOPHY BEGINS TO BELIEVE IN ITSELF. IT ALWAYS CREATES THE WORLD IN ITS OWN IMAGE; IT CANNOT DO OTHERWISE. PHILOSOPHY IS THIS TYRANNICAL DRIVE ITSELF, THE MOST SPIRITUAL WILL TO POWER, TO THE ‚ÄÚCREATION OF THE WORLD,‚ÄÙ TO THE CAUSA PRIMA.11





10


THE EAGERNESS AND SUBTLETY‚ÄÎI MIGHT EVEN SAY, SHREWDNESS‚ÄÎWITH WHICH THE PROBLEM OF ‚ÄÚTHE REAL AND THE APPARENT WORLD‚ÄÙ IS TODAY ATTACKED ALL OVER EUROPE MAKES ONE THINK AND WONDER; AND ANYONE WHO HEARS NOTHING IN THE BACKGROUND EXCEPT A ‚ÄÚWILL TO TRUTH,‚ÄÙ CERTAINLY DOES NOT HAVE THE BEST OF EARS. IN RARE AND ISOLATED INSTANCES IT MAY REALLY BE THE CASE THAT SUCH A WILL TO TRUTH, SOME EXTRAVAGANT AND ADVENTUROUS COURAGE, A METAPHYSICIAN‚ÄÔS AMBITION TO HOLD A HOPELESS POSITION, MAY PARTICIPATE AND ULTIMATELY PREFER EVEN A HANDFUL OF ‚ÄÚCERTAINTY‚ÄÙ TO A WHOLE CARLOAD OF BEAUTIFUL POSSIBILITIES; THERE MAY ACTUALLY BE PURITANICAL FANATICS OF CONSCIENCE, WHO PREFER EVEN A CERTAIN NOTHING TO AN UNCERTAIN SOMETHING TO LIE DOWN ON‚ÄÎAND DIE. BUT THIS IS NIHILISM AND THE SIGN OF A DESPAIRING, MORTALLY WEARY SOUL‚ÄÎHOWEVER COURAGEOUS THE GESTURES OF SUCH A VIRTUE MAY LOOK.

IT SEEMS, HOWEVER, TO BE OTHERWISE WITH STRONGER AND LIVELIER THINKERS WHO ARE STILL EAGER FOR LIFE. WHEN THEY SIDE AGAINST APPEARANCE, AND SPEAK OF ‚ÄÚPERSPECTIVE,‚ÄÙ WITH A NEW ARROGANCE; WHEN THEY RANK THE CREDIBILITY OF THEIR OWN BODIES ABOUT AS LOW AS THE CREDIBILITY OF THE VISUAL EVIDENCE THAT ‚ÄÚTHE EARTH STANDS STILL,‚ÄÙ AND THUS, APPARENTLY IN GOOD HUMOR, LET THEIR SECUREST POSSESSION GO (FOR IN WHAT DOES ONE AT PRESENT BELIEVE MORE FIRMLY THAN IN ONE‚ÄÔS BODY?)‚ÄÎWHO KNOWS IF THEY ARE NOT TRYING AT BOTTOM TO WIN BACK SOMETHING THAT WAS FORMERLY AN EVEN SECURER POSSESSION, SOMETHING OF THE ANCIENT DOMAIN OF THE FAITH OF FORMER TIMES, PERHAPS THE ‚ÄÚIMMORTAL SOUL,‚ÄÙ PERHAPS ‚ÄÚTHE OLD GOD,‚ÄÙ IN SHORT, IDEAS BY WHICH ONE COULD LIVE BETTER, THAT IS TO SAY, MORE VIGOROUSLY AND CHEERFULLY, THAN BY ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS‚ÄÙ? THERE IS MISTRUST OF THESE MODERN IDEAS IN THIS ATTITUDE, A DISBELIEF IN ALL THAT HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED YESTERDAY AND TODAY; THERE IS PERHAPS SOME SLIGHT ADMIXTURE OF SATIETY AND SCORN, UNABLE TO ENDURE ANY LONGER THE BRIC-A-BRAC OF CONCEPTS OF THE MOST DIVERSE ORIGIN, WHICH IS THE FORM IN WHICH SO-CALLED POSITIVISM OFFERS ITSELF ON THE MARKET TODAY; A DISGUST OF THE MORE FASTIDIOUS TASTE AT THE VILLAGE-FAIR MOTLEYNESS AND PATCHINESS OF ALL THESE REALITY-PHILOSOPHASTERS IN WHOM THERE IS NOTHING NEW OR GENUINE, EXCEPT THIS MOTLEYNESS. IN THIS, IT SEEMS TO ME, WE SHOULD AGREE WITH THESE SKEPTICAL ANTI-REALISTS AND KNOWLEDGE-MICROSCOPISTS OF TODAY: THEIR INSTINCT, WHICH REPELS THEM FROM MODERN REALITY, IS UNREFUTED‚ÄÎWHAT DO THEIR RETROGRADE BYPATHS CONCERN US! THE MAIN THING ABOUT THEM IS NOT THAT THEY WISH TO GO ‚ÄÚBACK,‚ÄÙ BUT THAT THEY WISH TO GET‚ÄÎAWAY. A LITTLE MORE STRENGTH, FLIGHT, COURAGE, AND ARTISTIC POWER, AND THEY WOULD WANT TO RISE‚ÄÎNOT RETURN!

IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TODAY ATTEMPTS ARE MADE EVERYWHERE TO DIVERT ATTENTION FROM THE ACTUAL INFLUENCE KANT EXERTED ON GERMAN PHILOSOPHY, AND ESPECIALLY TO IGNORE PRUDENTLY THE VALUE HE SET UPON HIMSELF. KANT WAS FIRST AND FOREMOST PROUD OF HIS TABLE OF CATEGORIES; WITH THAT IN HIS HAND HE SAID: ‚ÄÚTHIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT THING THAT COULD EVER BE UNDERTAKEN ON BEHALF OF METAPHYSICS.‚ÄÙ

LET US ONLY UNDERSTAND THIS ‚ÄÚCOULD BE‚ÄÙ! HE WAS PROUD OF HAVING DISCOVERED A NEW FACULTY IN MAN, THE FACULTY FOR SYNTHETIC JUDGMENTS, A PRIORI. SUPPOSE HE DECEIVED HIMSELF IN THIS MATTER; THE DEVELOPMENT AND RAPID FLOURISHING OF GERMAN PHILOSOPHY DEPENDED NEVERTHELESS ON HIS PRIDE, AND ON THE EAGER RIVALRY OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION TO DISCOVER, IF POSSIBLE, SOMETHING STILL PROUDER‚ÄÎAT ALL EVENTS ‚ÄÚNEW FACULTIES‚ÄÙ!

BUT LET US REFLECT; IT IS HIGH TIME TO DO SO. ‚ÄÚHOW ARE SYNTHETIC JUDGMENTS A PRIORI POSSIBLE?‚ÄÙ KANT ASKED HIMSELF‚ÄÎAND WHAT REALLY IS HIS ANSWER? ‚ÄÚBY VIRTUE OF A FACULTY‚ÄÙ12‚ÄÎBUT UNFORTUNATELY NOT IN FIVE WORDS, BUT SO CIRCUMSTANTIALLY, VENERABLY, AND WITH SUCH A DISPLAY OF GERMAN PROFUNDITY AND CURLICUES THAT PEOPLE SIMPLY FAILED TO NOTE THE COMICAL NIAISERIE ALLEMANDE13 INVOLVED IN SUCH AN ANSWER. PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY BESIDE THEMSELVES WITH DELIGHT OVER THIS NEW FACULTY, AND THE JUBILATION REACHED ITS CLIMAX WHEN KANT FURTHER DISCOVERED A MORAL FACULTY IN MAN‚ÄÎFOR AT THAT TIME THE GERMANS WERE STILL MORAL AND NOT YET ADDICTED TO REALPOLITIK.

THE HONEYMOON OF GERMAN PHILOSOPHY ARRIVED. ALL THE YOUNG THEOLOGIANS OF THE T√ºBINGEN SEMINARY WENT INTO THE BUSHES‚ÄÎALL LOOKING FOR ‚ÄÚFACULTIES.‚ÄÙ AND WHAT DID THEY NOT FIND‚ÄÎIN THAT INNOCENT, RICH, AND STILL YOUTHFUL PERIOD OF THE GERMAN SPIRIT, TO WHICH ROMANTICISM, THE MALIGNANT FAIRY, PIPED AND SANG, WHEN ONE COULD NOT YET DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ‚ÄÚFINDING‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚINVENTING‚ÄÙ!14 ABOVE ALL, A FACULTY FOR THE ‚ÄÚSURPRASENSIBLE‚ÄÙ: SCHELLING CHRISTENED IT INTELLECTUAL INTUITION, AND THUS GRATIFIED THE MOST HEARTFELT CRAVINGS OF THE GERMANS, WHOSE CRAVINGS WERE AT BOTTOM PIOUS. ONE CAN DO NO GREATER WRONG TO THE WHOLE OF THIS EXUBERANT AND ENTHUSIASTIC MOVEMENT, WHICH WAS REALLY YOUTHFULNESS, HOWEVER BOLDLY IT DISGUISED ITSELF IN HOARY AND SENILE CONCEPTS, THAN TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, OR WORSE, TO TREAT IT WITH MORAL INDIGNATION. ENOUGH, ONE GREW OLDER AND THE DREAM VANISHED. A TIME CAME WHEN PEOPLE SCRATCHED THEIR HEADS, AND THEY STILL SCRATCH THEM TODAY. ONE HAD BEEN DREAMING, AND FIRST AND FOREMOST‚ÄÎOLD KANT. ‚ÄÚBY VIRTUE OF A FACULTY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHE HAD SAID, OR AT LEAST MEANT. BUT IS THAT‚ÄÎAN ANSWER? AN EXPLANATION? OR IS IT NOT RATHER MERELY A REPETITION OF THE QUESTION? HOW DOES OPIUM INDUCE SLEEP? ‚ÄÚBY VIRTUE OF A FACULTY,‚ÄÙ NAMELY THE VIRTUS DORMITIVA, REPLIES THE DOCTOR IN MOLI√®RE,

QUIA EST IN EO VIRTUS DORMITIVA,

CUJUS EST NATURA SENSUS ASSOUPIRE.15



BUT SUCH REPLIES BELONG IN COMEDY, AND IT IS HIGH TIME TO REPLACE THE KANTIAN QUESTION, ‚ÄÚHOW ARE SYNTHETIC JUDGMENTS A PRIORI POSSIBLE?‚ÄÙ BY ANOTHER QUESTION, ‚ÄÚWHY IS BELIEF IN SUCH JUDGMENTS NECESSARY?‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND TO COMPREHEND THAT SUCH JUDGMENTS MUST BE BELIEVED TO BE TRUE, FOR THE SAKE OF THE PRESERVATION OF CREATURES LIKE OURSELVES; THOUGH THEY MIGHT, OF COURSE, BE FALSE JUDGMENTS FOR ALL THAT! OR TO SPEAK MORE CLEARLY AND COARSELY: SYNTHETIC JUDGMENTS A PRIORI SHOULD NOT ‚ÄÚBE POSSIBLE‚ÄÙ AT ALL; WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO THEM; IN OUR MOUTHS THEY ARE NOTHING BUT FALSE JUDGMENTS. ONLY, OF COURSE, THE BELIEF IN THEIR TRUTH IS NECESSARY, AS A FOREGROUND BELIEF AND VISUAL EVIDENCE BELONGING TO THE PERSPECTIVE OPTICS OF LIFE.

FINALLY, TO CALL TO MIND THE ENORMOUS INFLUENCE THAT ‚ÄÚGERMAN PHILOSOPHY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎI HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND ITS RIGHT TO QUOTATION MARKS‚ÄÎHAS EXERCISED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF EUROPE, THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT A CERTAIN VIRTUS DORMITIVA HAD A SHARE IN IT: IT WAS A DELIGHT TO THE NOBLE IDLERS, THE VIRTUOUS, THE MYSTICS, ARTISTS, THREE-QUARTER CHRISTIANS, AND POLITICAL OBSCURANTISTS OF ALL NATIONS, TO FIND, THANKS TO GERMAN PHILOSOPHY, AN ANTIDOTE TO THE STILL PREDOMINANT SENSUALISM WHICH OVERFLOWED FROM THE LAST CENTURY INTO THIS, IN SHORT‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚSENSUS ASSOUPIRE.‚ÄÙ





12


AS FOR MATERIALISTIC ATOMISM, IT IS ONE OF THE BEST REFUTED THEORIES THERE ARE, AND IN EUROPE PERHAPS NO ONE IN THE LEARNED WORLD IS NOW SO UNSCHOLARLY AS TO ATTACH SERIOUS SIGNIFICANCE TO IT, EXCEPT FOR CONVENIENT HOUSEHOLD USE (AS AN ABBREVIATION OF THE MEANS OF EXPRESSION)‚ÄÎTHANKS CHIEFLY TO THE DALMATIAN BOSCOVICH: HE AND THE POLE CORPERNICUS HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST AND MOST SUCCESSFUL OPPONENTS OF VISUAL EVIDENCE SO FAR. FOR WHILE COPERNICUS HAS PERSUADED US TO BELIEVE, CONTRARY TO ALL THE SENSES, THAT THE EARTH DOES NOT STAND FAST, BOSCOVICH HAS TAUGHT US TO ABJURE THE BELIEF IN THE LAST PART OF THE EARTH THAT ‚ÄÚSTOOD FAST‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHE BELIEF IN ‚ÄÚSUBSTANCE,‚ÄÙ IN ‚ÄÚMATTER,‚ÄÙ IN THE EARTH-RESIDUUM AND PARTICLE-ATOM:16 IT IS THE GREATEST TRIUMPH OVER THE SENSES THAT HAS BEEN GAINED ON EARTH SO FAR.

ONE MUST, HOWEVER, GO STILL FURTHER, AND ALSO DECLARE WAR, RELENTLESS WAR UNTO DEATH, AGAINST THE ‚ÄÚATOMISTIC NEED‚ÄÙ WHICH STILL LEADS A DANGEROUS AFTERLIFE IN PLACES WHERE NO ONE SUSPECTS IT, JUST LIKE THE MORE CELEBRATED ‚ÄÚMETAPHYSICAL NEED‚ÄÙ: ONE MUST ALSO, FIRST OF ALL, GIVE THE FINISHING STROKE TO THAT OTHER AND MORE CALAMITOUS ATOMISM WHICH CHRISTIANITY HAS TAUGHT BEST AND LONGEST, THE SOUL ATOMISM. LET IT BE PERMITTED TO DESIGNATE BY THIS EXPRESSION THE BELIEF WHICH REGARDS THE SOUL AS SOMETHING INDESTRUCTIBLE, ETERNAL, INDIVISIBLE, AS A MONAD, AS AN ATOMON: THIS BELIEF OUGHT TO BE EXPELLED FROM SCIENCE! BETWEEN OURSELVES, IT IS NOT AT ALL NECESSARY TO GET RID OF ‚ÄÚTHE SOUL‚ÄÙ AT THE SAME TIME, AND THUS TO RENOUNCE ONE OF THE MOST ANCIENT AND VENERABLE HYPOTHESES‚ÄÎAS HAPPENS FREQUENTLY TO CLUMSY NATURALISTS WHO CAN HARDLY TOUCH ON ‚ÄÚTHE SOUL‚ÄÙ WITHOUT IMMEDIATELY LOSING IT. BUT THE WAY IS OPEN FOR NEW VERSIONS AND REFINEMENTS OF THE SOUL-HYPOTHESIS; AND SUCH CONCEPTIONS AS ‚ÄÚMORTAL SOUL,‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚSOUL AS SUBJECTIVE MULTIPLICITY,‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚSOUL AS SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF THE DRIVES AND AFFECTS,‚ÄÙ17 WANT HENCEFORTH TO HAVE CITIZENS‚ÄÔ RIGHTS IN SCIENCE. WHEN THE NEW PSYCHOLOGIST PUTS AN END TO THE SUPERSTITIONS WHICH HAVE SO FAR FLOURISHED WITH ALMOST TROPICAL LUXURIANCE AROUND THE IDEA OF THE SOUL, HE PRACTICALLY EXILES HIMSELF INTO A NEW DESERT AND A NEW SUSPICION‚ÄÎIT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OLDER PSYCHOLOGISTS HAD A MERRIER AND MORE COMFORTABLE TIME OF IT; EVENTUALLY, HOWEVER, HE FINDS THAT PRECISELY THEREBY HE ALSO CONDEMNS HIMSELF TO INVENTION‚ÄÎAND‚ÄÎWHO KNOWS?‚ÄÎPERHAPS TO DISCOVERY.





13


PHYSIOLOGISTS SHOULD THINK BEFORE PUTTING DOWN THE INSTINCT OF SELF-PRESERVATION AS THE CARDINAL INSTINCT OF AN ORGANIC BEING. A LIVING THING SEEKS ABOVE ALL TO DISCHARGE ITS STRENGTH‚ÄÎLIFE ITSELF IS WILL TO POWER; SELF-PRESERVATION IS ONLY ONE OF THE INDIRECT AND MOST FREQUENT RESULTS.

IN SHORT, HERE AS EVERYWHERE ELSE, LET US BEWARE OF SUPERFLUOUS TELEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES‚ÄÎONE OF WHICH IS THE INSTINCT OF SELF-PRESERVATION (WE OWE IT TO SPINOZA‚ÄÔS INCONSISTENCY).18 THUS METHOD, WHICH MUST BE ESSENTIALLY ECONOMY OF PRINCIPLES, DEMANDS IT.





14


IT IS PERHAPS JUST DAWNING ON FIVE OR SIX MINDS THAT PHYSICS, TOO, IS ONLY AN INTERPRETATION AND EXEGESIS OF THE WORLD (TO SUIT US, IF I MAY SAY SO!) AND NOT A WORLD-EXPLANATION; BUT INSOFAR AS IT IS BASED ON BELIEF IN THE SENSES, IT IS REGARDED AS MORE, AND FOR A LONG TIME TO COME MUST BE REGARDED AS MORE‚ÄÎNAMELY, AS AN EXPLANATION. EYES AND FINGERS SPEAK IN ITS FAVOR, VISUAL EVIDENCE AND PALPABLENESS DO, TOO: THIS STRIKES AN AGE WITH FUNDAMENTALLY PLEBEIAN TASTES AS FASCINATING, PERSUASIVE, AND CONVINCING‚ÄÎAFTER ALL, IT FOLLOWS INSTINCTIVELY THE CANON OF TRUTH OF ETERNALLY POPULAR SENSUALISM. WHAT IS CLEAR, WHAT IS ‚ÄÚEXPLAINED‚ÄÙ? ONLY WHAT CAN BE SEEN AND FELT‚ÄÎEVERY PROBLEM HAS TO BE PURSUED TO THAT POINT. CONVERSELY, THE CHARM OF THE PLATONIC WAY OF THINKING, WHICH WAS A NOBLE WAY OF THINKING, CONSISTED PRECISELY IN RESISTANCE TO OBVIOUS SENSE-EVIDENCE‚ÄÎPERHAPS AMONG MEN WHO ENJOYED EVEN STRONGER AND MORE DEMANDING SENSES THAN OUR CONTEMPORARIES, BUT WHO KNEW HOW TO FIND A HIGHER TRIUMPH IN REMAINING MASTERS OF THEIR SENSES‚ÄÎAND THIS BY MEANS OF PALE, COLD, GRAY CONCEPT NETS WHICH THEY THREW OVER THE MOTLEY WHIRL OF THE SENSES‚ÄÎTHE MOB OF THE SENSES, AS PLATO SAID. IN THIS OVERCOMING OF THE WORLD, AND INTERPRETING OF THE WORLD IN THE MANNER OF PLATO, THERE WAS AN ENJOYMENT DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH THE PHYSICISTS OF TODAY OFFER US‚ÄÎAND ALSO THE DARWINISTS AND ANTI-TELEOLOGISTS AMONG THE WORKERS IN PHYSIOLOGY, WITH THEIR PRINCIPLE OF THE ‚ÄÚSMALLEST POSSIBLE FORCE‚ÄÙ AND THE GREATEST POSSIBLE STUPIDITY. ‚ÄÚWHERE MAN CANNOT FIND ANYTHING TO SEE OR TO GRASP, HE HAS NO FURTHER BUSINESS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT IS CERTAINLY AN IMPERATIVE DIFFERENT FROM THE PLATONIC ONE, BUT IT MAY BE THE RIGHT IMPERATIVE FOR A TOUGH, INDUSTRIOUS RACE OF MACHINISTS AND BRIDGE-BUILDERS OF THE FUTURE, WHO HAVE NOTHING BUT ROUGH WORK TO DO.





15


TO STUDY PHYSIOLOGY WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE, ONE MUST INSIST THAT THE SENSE ORGANS ARE NOT PHENOMENA IN THE SENSE OF IDEALISTIC PHILOSOPHY; AS SUCH THEY COULD NOT BE CAUSES! SENSUALISM, THEREFORE, AT LEAST AS A REGULATIVE HYPOTHESIS, IF NOT AS A HEURISTIC PRINCIPLE.

WHAT? AND OTHERS EVEN SAY THAT THE EXTERNAL WORLD IS THE WORK OF OUR ORGANS? BUT THEN OUR BODY, AS A PART OF THIS EXTERNAL WORLD, WOULD BE THE WORK OF OUR ORGANS! BUT THEN OUR ORGANS THEMSELVES WOULD BE‚ÄÎTHE WORK OF OUR ORGANS! IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS A COMPLETE REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM,19 ASSUMING THAT THE CONCEPT OF A CAUSA SUI20 IS SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY ABSURD. CONSEQUENTLY, THE EXTERNAL WORLD IS NOT THE WORK OF OUR ORGANS‚ÄÎ?





16


THERE ARE STILL HARMLESS SELF-OBSERVERS WHO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ‚ÄÚIMMEDIATE CERTAINTIES;‚ÄÙ FOR EXAMPLE, ‚ÄÚI THINK,‚ÄÙ OR AS THE SUPERSTITION OF SCHOPENHAUER PUT IT, ‚ÄÚI WILL;‚ÄÙ AS THOUGH KNOWLEDGE HERE GOT HOLD OF ITS OBJECT PURELY AND NAKEDLY AS ‚ÄÚTHE THING IN ITSELF,‚ÄÙ WITHOUT ANY FALSIFICATION ON THE PART OF EITHER THE SUBJECT OR THE OBJECT. BUT THAT ‚ÄÚIMMEDIATE CERTAINTY,‚ÄÙ AS WELL AS ‚ÄÚABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE‚ÄÙ AND THE ‚ÄÚTHING IN ITSELF,‚ÄÙ INVOLVE A CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO,21 I SHALL REPEAT A HUNDRED TIMES; WE REALLY OUGHT TO FREE OURSELVES FROM THE SEDUCTION OF WORDS!

LET THE PEOPLE SUPPOSE THAT KNOWLEDGE MEANS KNOWING THINGS ENTIRELY; THE PHILOSOPHER MUST SAY TO HIMSELF: WHEN I ANALYZE THE PROCESS THAT IS EXPRESSED IN THE SENTENCE, ‚ÄÚI THINK,‚ÄÙ I FIND A WHOLE SERIES OF DARING ASSERTIONS THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT, PERHAPS IMPOSSIBLE, TO PROVE; FOR EXAMPLE, THAT IT IS I WHO THINK, THAT THERE MUST NECESSARILY BE SOMETHING THAT THINKS, THAT THINKING IS AN ACTIVITY AND OPERATION ON THE PART OF A BEING WHO IS THOUGHT OF AS A CAUSE, THAT THERE IS AN ‚ÄÚEGO,‚ÄÙ AND, FINALLY, THAT IT IS ALREADY DETERMINED WHAT IS TO BE DESIGNATED BY THINKING‚ÄÎTHAT I KNOW WHAT THINKING IS. FOR IF I HAD NOT ALREADY DECIDED WITHIN MYSELF WHAT IT IS, BY WHAT STANDARD COULD I DETERMINE WHETHER THAT WHICH IS JUST HAPPENING IS NOT PERHAPS ‚ÄÚWILLING‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚFEELING‚ÄÙ? IN SHORT, THE ASSERTION ‚ÄÚI THINK‚ÄÙ ASSUMES THAT I COMPARE MY STATE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WITH OTHER STATES OF MYSELF WHICH I KNOW, IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHAT IT IS; ON ACCOUNT OF THIS RETROSPECTIVE CONNECTION WITH FURTHER ‚ÄÚKNOWLEDGE,‚ÄÙ IT HAS, AT ANY RATE, NO IMMEDIATE CERTAINTY FOR ME.

IN PLACE OF THE ‚ÄÚIMMEDIATE CERTAINTY‚ÄÙ IN WHICH THE PEOPLE MAY BELIEVE IN THE CASE AT HAND, THE PHILOSOPHER THUS FINDS A SERIES OF METAPHYSICAL QUESTIONS PRESENTED TO HIM, TRULY SEARCHING QUESTIONS OF THE INTELLECT; TO WIT: ‚ÄÚFROM WHERE DO I GET THE CONCEPT OF THINKING? WHY DO I BELIEVE IN CAUSE AND EFFECT? WHAT GIVES ME THE RIGHT TO SPEAK OF AN EGO, AND EVEN OF AN EGO AS CAUSE, AND FINALLY OF AN EGO AS THE CAUSE OF THOUGHT?‚ÄÙ WHOEVER VENTURES TO ANSWER THESE METAPHYSICAL QUESTIONS AT ONCE BY AN APPEAL TO A SORT OF INTUITIVE PERCEPTION, LIKE THE PERSON WHO SAYS, ‚ÄÚI THINK, AND KNOW THAT THIS, AT LEAST, IS TRUE, ACTUAL, AND CERTAIN‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWILL ENCOUNTER A SMILE AND TWO QUESTION MARKS FROM A PHILOSOPHER NOWADAYS. ‚ÄÚSIR,‚ÄÙ THE PHILOSOPHER WILL PERHAPS GIVE HIM TO UNDERSTAND, ‚ÄÚIT IS IMPROBABLE THAT YOU ARE NOT MISTAKEN; BUT WHY INSIST ON THE TRUTH?‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎ

WITH REGARD TO THE SUPERSTITIONS OF LOGICIANS, I SHALL NEVER TIRE OF EMPHASIZING A SMALL TERSE FACT, WHICH THESE SUPERSTITIOUS MINDS HATE TO CONCEDE‚ÄÎNAMELY, THAT A THOUGHT COMES WHEN ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÙ WISHES, AND NOT WHEN ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÙ WISH, SO THAT IT IS A FALSIFICATION OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE TO SAY THAT THE SUBJECT ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÙ IS THE CONDITION OF THE PREDICATE ‚ÄÚTHINK.‚ÄÙ IT THINKS; BUT THAT THIS ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÙ IS PRECISELY THE FAMOUS OLD ‚ÄÚEGO‚ÄÙ IS, TO PUT IT MILDLY, ONLY A SUPPOSITION, AN ASSERTION, AND ASSUREDLY NOT AN ‚ÄÚIMMEDIATE CERTAINTY.‚ÄÙ AFTER ALL, ONE HAS EVEN GONE TOO FAR WITH THIS ‚ÄÚIT THINKS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎEVEN THE ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÙ CONTAINS AN INTERPRETATION OF THE PROCESS, AND DOES NOT BELONG TO THE PROCESS ITSELF. ONE INFERS HERE ACCORDING TO THE GRAMMATICAL HABIT: ‚ÄÚTHINKING IS AN ACTIVITY; EVERY ACTIVITY REQUIRES AN AGENT; CONSEQUENTLY‚ÄÎ‚ÄÙ

IT WAS PRETTY MUCH ACCORDING TO THE SAME SCHEMA THAT THE OLDER ATOMISM SOUGHT, BESIDES THE OPERATING ‚ÄÚPOWER,‚ÄÙ THAT LUMP OF MATTER IN WHICH IT RESIDES AND OUT OF WHICH IT OPERATES‚ÄÎTHE ATOM. MORE RIGOROUS MINDS, HOWEVER, LEARNED AT LAST TO GET ALONG WITHOUT THIS ‚ÄÚEARTH-RESIDUUM,‚ÄÙ AND PERHAPS SOME DAY WE SHALL ACCUSTOM OURSELVES, INCLUDING THE LOGICIANS, TO GET ALONG WITHOUT THE LITTLE ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÙ (WHICH IS ALL THAT IS LEFT OF THE HONEST LITTLE OLD EGO).





18


IT IS CERTAINLY NOT THE LEAST CHARM OF A THEORY THAT IT IS REFUTABLE; IT IS PRECISELY THEREBY THAT IT ATTRACTS SUBTLER MINDS. IT SEEMS THAT THE HUNDRED-TIMES-REFUTED THEORY OF A ‚ÄÚFREE WILL‚ÄÙ OWES ITS PERSISTENCE TO THIS CHARM ALONE; AGAIN AND AGAIN SOMEONE COMES ALONG WHO FEELS HE IS STRONG ENOUGH TO REFUTE IT.





19


PHILOSOPHERS ARE ACCUSTOMED TO SPEAK OF THE WILL AS IF IT WERE THE BEST-KNOWN THING IN THE WORLD; INDEED, SCHOPENHAUER HAS GIVEN US TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WILL ALONE IS REALLY KNOWN TO US, ABSOLUTELY AND COMPLETELY KNOWN, WITHOUT SUBTRACTION OR ADDITION. BUT AGAIN AND AGAIN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN THIS CASE, TOO, SCHOPENHAUER ONLY DID WHAT PHILOSOPHERS ARE IN THE HABIT OF DOING‚ÄÎHE ADOPTED A POPULAR PREJUDICE AND EXAGGERATED IT. WILLING SEEMS TO ME TO BE ABOVE ALL SOMETHING COMPLICATED, SOMETHING THAT IS A UNIT ONLY AS A WORD‚ÄÎAND IT IS PRECISELY IN THIS ONE WORD THAT THE POPULAR PREJUDICE LURKS, WHICH HAS DEFEATED THE ALWAYS INADEQUATE CAUTION OF PHILOSOPHERS. SO LET US FOR ONCE BE MORE CAUTIOUS, LET US BE ‚ÄÚUNPHILOSOPHICAL‚ÄÙ: LET US SAY THAT IN ALL WILLING THERE IS, FIRST, A PLURALITY OF SENSATIONS, NAMELY, THE SENSATION OF THE STATE ‚ÄÚAWAY FROM WHICH,‚ÄÙ THE SENSATION OF THE STATE ‚ÄÚTOWARDS WHICH,‚ÄÙ THE SENSATIONS OF THIS ‚ÄÚFROM‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚTOWARDS‚ÄÙ THEMSELVES, AND THEN ALSO AN ACCOMPANYING MUSCULAR SENSATION, WHICH, EVEN WITHOUT OUR PUTTING INTO MOTION ‚ÄÚARMS AND LEGS,‚ÄÙ BEGINS ITS ACTION BY FORCE OF HABIT AS SOON AS WE ‚ÄÚWILL‚ÄÙ ANYTHING.

THEREFORE, JUST AS SENSATIONS (AND INDEED MANY KINDS OF SENSATIONS) ARE TO BE RECOGNIZED AS INGREDIENTS OF THE WILL, SO, SECONDLY, SHOULD THINKING ALSO: IN EVERY ACT OF THE WILL THERE IS A RULING THOUGHT‚ÄÎLET US NOT IMAGINE IT POSSIBLE TO SEVER THIS THOUGHT FROM THE ‚ÄÚWILLING,‚ÄÙ AS IF ANY WILL WOULD THEN REMAIN OVER!

THIRD, THE WILL IS NOT ONLY A COMPLEX OF SENSATION AND THINKING, BUT IT IS ABOVE ALL AN AFFECT, AND SPECIFICALLY THE AFFECT OF THE COMMAND. THAT WHICH IS TERMED ‚ÄÚFREEDOM OF THE WILL‚ÄÙ IS ESSENTIALLY THE AFFECT OF SUPERIORITY IN RELATION TO HIM WHO MUST OBEY: ‚ÄÚI AM FREE, ‚ÄÒHE‚ÄÔ MUST OBEY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHIS CONSCIOUSNESS IS INHERENT IN EVERY WILL; AND EQUALLY SO THE STRAINING OF THE ATTENTION, THE STRAIGHT LOOK THAT FIXES ITSELF EXCLUSIVELY ON ONE AIM, THE UNCONDITIONAL EVALUATION THAT ‚ÄÚTHIS AND NOTHING ELSE IS NECESSARY NOW,‚ÄÙ THE INWARD CERTAINTY THAT OBEDIENCE WILL BE RENDERED‚ÄÎAND WHATEVER ELSE BELONGS TO THE POSITION OF THE COMMANDER. A MAN WHO WILLS COMMANDS SOMETHING WITHIN HIMSELF THAT RENDERS OBEDIENCE, OR THAT HE BELIEVES RENDERS OBEDIENCE.

BUT NOW LET US NOTICE WHAT IS STRANGEST ABOUT THE WILL‚ÄÎTHIS MANIFOLD THING FOR WHICH THE PEOPLE HAVE ONLY ONE WORD: INASMUCH AS IN THE GIVEN CIRCUMSTANCES WE ARE AT THE SAME TIME THE COMMANDING AND THE OBEYING PARTIES, AND AS THE OBEYING PARTY WE KNOW THE SENSATIONS OF CONSTRAINT, IMPULSION, PRESSURE, RESISTANCE, AND MOTION, WHICH USUALLY BEGIN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ACT OF WILL; INASMUCH AS, ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO DISREGARD THIS DUALITY, AND TO DECEIVE OURSELVES ABOUT IT BY MEANS OF THE SYNTHETIC CONCEPT ‚ÄÚI,‚ÄÙ A WHOLE SERIES OF ERRONEOUS CONCLUSIONS, AND CONSEQUENTLY OF FALSE EVALUATIONS OF THE WILL ITSELF, HAS BECOME ATTACHED TO THE ACT OF WILLING‚ÄÎTO SUCH A DEGREE THAT HE WHO WILLS BELIEVES SINCERELY THAT WILLING SUFFICES FOR ACTION. SINCE IN THE GREAT MAJORITY OF CASES THERE HAS BEEN EXERCISE OF WILL ONLY WHEN THE EFFECT OF THE COMMAND‚ÄÎTHAT IS, OBEDIENCE; THAT IS, THE ACTION‚ÄÎWAS TO BE EXPECTED, THE APPEARANCE HAS TRANSLATED ITSELF INTO THE FEELING, AS IF THERE WERE A NECESSITY OF EFFECT. IN SHORT, HE WHO WILLS BELIEVES WITH A FAIR AMOUNT OF CERTAINTY THAT WILL AND ACTION ARE SOMEHOW ONE; HE ASCRIBES THE SUCCESS, THE CARRYING OUT OF THE WILLING, TO THE WILL ITSELF, AND THEREBY ENJOYS AN INCREASE OF THE SENSATION OF POWER WHICH ACCOMPANIES ALL SUCCESS.

‚ÄÚFREEDOM OF THE WILL‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT IS THE EXPRESSION FOR THE COMPLEX STATE OF DELIGHT OF THE PERSON EXERCISING VOLITION, WHO COMMANDS AND AT THE SAME TIME IDENTIFIES HIMSELF WITH THE EXECUTOR OF THE ORDER‚ÄÎWHO, AS SUCH, ENJOYS ALSO THE TRIUMPH OVER OBSTACLES, BUT THINKS WITHIN HIMSELF THAT IT WAS REALLY HIS WILL ITSELF THAT OVERCAME THEM. IN THIS WAY THE PERSON EXERCISING VOLITION ADDS THE FEELINGS OF DELIGHT OF HIS SUCCESSFUL EXECUTIVE INSTRUMENTS, THE USEFUL ‚ÄÚUNDER-WILLS‚ÄÙ OR UNDER-SOULS‚ÄÎINDEED, OUR BODY IS BUT A SOCIAL STRUCTURE COMPOSED OF MANY SOULS‚ÄÎTO HIS FEELINGS OF DELIGHT AS COMMANDER. L‚ÄÔEFFET C‚ÄÔEST MOI:22 WHAT HAPPENS HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS IN EVERY WELL-CONSTRUCTED AND HAPPY COMMONWEALTH; NAMELY, THE GOVERNING CLASS IDENTIFIES ITSELF WITH THE SUCCESSES OF THE COMMONWEALTH. IN ALL WILLING IT IS ABSOLUTELY A QUESTION OF COMMANDING AND OBEYING, ON THE BASIS, AS ALREADY SAID, OF A SOCIAL STRUCTURE COMPOSED OF MANY ‚ÄÚSOULS.‚ÄÙ HENCE A PHILOSOPHER SHOULD CLAIM THE RIGHT TO INCLUDE WILLING AS SUCH WITHIN THE SPHERE OF MORALS‚ÄÎMORALS BEING UNDERSTOOD AS THE DOCTRINE OF THE RELATIONS OF SUPREMACY UNDER WHICH THE PHENOMENON OF ‚ÄÚLIFE‚ÄÙ COMES TO BE.

THAT INDIVIDUAL PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS ARE NOT ANYTHING CAPRICIOUS OR AUTONOMOUSLY EVOLVING, BUT GROW UP IN CONNECTION AND RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH OTHER; THAT, HOWEVER SUDDENLY AND ARBITRARILY THEY SEEM TO APPEAR IN THE HISTORY OF THOUGHT, THEY NEVERTHELESS BELONG JUST AS MUCH TO A SYSTEM AS ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAUNA OF A CONTINENT‚ÄÎIS BETRAYED IN THE END ALSO BY THE FACT THAT THE MOST DIVERSE PHILOSOPHERS KEEP FILLING IN A DEFINITE FUNDAMENTAL SCHEME OF POSSIBLE PHILOSOPHIES. UNDER AN INVISIBLE SPELL, THEY ALWAYS REVOLVE ONCE MORE IN THE SAME ORBIT; HOWEVER INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER THEY MAY FEEL THEMSELVES WITH THEIR CRITICAL OR SYSTEMATIC WILLS, SOMETHING WITHIN THEM LEADS THEM, SOMETHING IMPELS THEM IN A DEFINITE ORDER, ONE AFTER THE OTHER‚ÄÎTO WIT, THE INNATE SYSTEMATIC STRUCTURE AND RELATIONSHIP OF THEIR CONCEPTS. THEIR THINKING IS, IN FACT, FAR LESS A DISCOVERY THAN A RECOGNITION, A REMEMBERING, A RETURN AND A HOMECOMING TO A REMOTE, PRIMORDIAL, AND INCLUSIVE HOUSEHOLD OF THE SOUL, OUT OF WHICH THOSE CONCEPTS GREW ORIGINALLY: PHILOSOPHIZING IS TO THIS EXTENT A KIND OF ATAVISM OF THE HIGHEST ORDER.

THE STRANGE FAMILY RESEMBLANCE OF ALL INDIAN, GREEK, AND GERMAN PHILOSOPHIZING IS EXPLAINED EASILY ENOUGH. WHERE THERE IS AFFINITY OF LANGUAGES, IT CANNOT FAIL, OWING TO THE COMMON PHILOSOPHY OF GRAMMAR‚ÄÎI MEAN, OWING TO THE UNCONSCIOUS DOMINATION AND GUIDANCE BY SIMILAR GRAMMATICAL FUNCTIONS‚ÄÎTHAT EVERYTHING IS PREPARED AT THE OUTSET FOR A SIMILAR DEVELOPMENT AND SEQUENCE OF PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS; JUST AS THE WAY SEEMS BARRED AGAINST CERTAIN OTHER POSSIBILITIES OF WORLD-INTERPRETATION. IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT PHILOSOPHERS WITHIN THE DOMAIN OF THE URAL-ALTAIC LANGUAGES (WHERE THE CONCEPT OF THE SUBJECT IS LEAST DEVELOPED) LOOK OTHERWISE ‚ÄÚINTO THE WORLD,‚ÄÙ AND WILL BE FOUND ON PATHS OF THOUGHT DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE INDO-GERMANIC PEOPLES AND THE MUSLIMS: THE SPELL OF CERTAIN GRAMMATICAL FUNCTIONS IS ULTIMATELY ALSO THE SPELL OF PHYSIOLOGICAL VALUATIONS AND RACIAL CONDITIONS.

SO MUCH BY WAY OF REJECTING LOCKE‚ÄÔS SUPERFICIALITY REGARDING THE ORIGIN OF IDEAS.

THE CAUSA SUI IS THE BEST SELF-CONTRADICTION THAT HAS BEEN CONCEIVED SO FAR, IT IS A SORT OF RAPE AND PERVERSION OF LOGIC; BUT THE EXTRAVAGANT PRIDE OF MAN HAS MANAGED TO ENTANGLE ITSELF PROFOUNDLY AND FRIGHTFULLY WITH JUST THIS NONSENSE. THE DESIRE FOR ‚ÄÚFREEDOM OF THE WILL‚ÄÙ IN THE SUPERLATIVE METAPHYSICAL SENSE, WHICH STILL HOLDS SWAY, UNFORTUNATELY, IN THE MINDS OF THE HALF-EDUCATED; THE DESIRE TO BEAR THE ENTIRE AND ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ONE‚ÄÔS ACTIONS ONESELF, AND TO ABSOLVE GOD, THE WORLD, ANCESTORS, CHANCE, AND SOCIETY INVOLVES NOTHING LESS THAN TO BE PRECISELY THIS CAUSA SUI AND, WITH MORE THAN M√ºNCHHAUSEN‚ÄÔS AUDACITY, TO PULL ONESELF UP INTO EXISTENCE BY THE HAIR, OUT OF THE SWAMPS OF NOTHINGNESS.23 SUPPOSE POSE SOMEONE WERE THUS TO SEE THROUGH THE BOORISH SIMPLICITY OF THIS CELEBRATED CONCEPT OF ‚ÄÚFREE WILL‚ÄÙ AND PUT IT OUT OF HIS HEAD ALTOGETHER, I BEG OF HIM TO CARRY HIS ‚ÄÚENLIGHTENMENT‚ÄÙ A STEP FURTHER, AND ALSO PUT OUT OF HIS HEAD THE CONTRARY OF THIS MONSTROUS CONCEPTION OF ‚ÄÚFREE WILL‚ÄÙ: I MEAN ‚ÄÚUNFREE WILL,‚ÄÙ WHICH AMOUNTS TO A MISUSE OF CAUSE AND EFFECT. ONE SHOULD NOT WRONGLY REIFY ‚ÄÚCAUSE‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚEFFECT,‚ÄÙ AS THE NATURAL SCIENTISTS DO (AND WHOEVER, LIKE THEM, NOW ‚ÄÚNATURALIZES‚ÄÙ IN HIS THINKING), ACCORDING TO THE PREVAILING MECHANICAL DOLTISHNESS WHICH MAKES THE CAUSE PRESS AND PUSH UNTIL IT ‚ÄÚEFFECTS‚ÄÙ ITS END; ONE SHOULD USE ‚ÄÚCAUSE‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚEFFECT‚ÄÙ ONLY AS PURE CONCEPTS, THAT IS TO SAY, AS CONVENTIONAL FICTIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DESIGNATION AND COMMUNICATION‚ÄÎNOT FOR EXPLANATION. IN THE ‚ÄÚIN-ITSELF‚ÄÙ THERE IS NOTHING OF ‚ÄÚCAUSAL CONNECTIONS,‚ÄÙ OF ‚ÄÚNECESSITY,‚ÄÙ OR OF ‚ÄÚPSYCHOLOGICAL NON-FREEDOM;‚ÄÙ THERE THE EFFECT DOES NOT FOLLOW THE CAUSE, THERE IS NO RULE OF ‚ÄÚLAW.‚ÄÙ IT IS WE ALONE WHO HAVE DEVISED CAUSE, SEQUENCE, FOR-EACH-OTHER, RELATIVITY, CONSTRAINT, NUMBER, LAW, FREEDOM, MOTIVE, AND PURPOSE; AND WHEN WE PROJECT AND MIX THIS SYMBOL WORLD INTO THINGS AS IF IT EXISTED ‚ÄÚIN ITSELF,‚ÄÙ WE ACT ONCE MORE AS WE HAVE ALWAYS ACTED‚ÄÎMYTHOLOGICALLY. THE ‚ÄÚUNFREE WILL‚ÄÙ IS MYTHOLOGY; IN REAL LIFE IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF STRONG AND WEAK WILLS.

IT IS ALMOST ALWAYS A SYMPTOM OF WHAT IS LACKING IN HIMSELF WHEN A THINKER SENSES IN EVERY ‚ÄÚCAUSAL CONNECTION‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚPSYCHOLOGICAL NECESSITY‚ÄÙ SOMETHING OF CONSTRAINT, NEED, COMPULSION TO OBEY, PRESSURE, AND UNFREEDOM; IT IS SUSPICIOUS TO HAVE SUCH FEELINGS‚ÄÎTHE PERSON BETRAYS HIMSELF. AND IN GENERAL, IF I HAVE OBSERVED CORRECTLY, THE ‚ÄÚUNFREEDOM OF THE WILL‚ÄÙ IS REGARDED AS A PROBLEM FROM TWO ENTIRELY OPPOSITE STANDPOINTS, BUT ALWAYS IN A PROFOUNDLY PERSONAL MANNER: SOME WILL NOT GIVE UP THEIR ‚ÄÚRESPONSIBILITY,‚ÄÙ THEIR BELIEF IN THEMSELVES, THE PERSONAL RIGHT TO THEIR MERITS AT ANY PRICE (THE VAIN RACES BELONG TO THIS CLASS). OTHERS, ON THE CONTRARY, DO NOT WISH TO BE ANSWERABLE FOR ANYTHING, OR BLAMED FOR ANYTHING, AND OWING TO AN INWARD SELF-CONTEMPT, SEEK TO LAY THE BLAME FOR THEMSELVES SOMEWHERE ELSE. THE LATTER, WHEN THEY WRITE BOOKS, ARE IN THE HABIT TODAY OF TAKING THE SIDE OF CRIMINALS; A SORT OF SOCIALIST PITY IS THEIR MOST ATTRACTIVE DISGUISE. AND AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE FATALISM OF THE WEAK-WILLED EMBELLISHES ITSELF SURPRISINGLY WHEN IT CAN POSE AS ‚ÄÚLA RELIGION DE LA SOUFFRANCE HUMAINE‚ÄÙ;24 THAT IS ITS ‚ÄÚGOOD TASTE.‚ÄÙ

FORGIVE ME AS AN OLD PHILOLOGIST WHO CANNOT DESIST FROM THE MALICE OF PUTTING HIS FINGER ON BAD MODES OF INTERPRETATION: BUT ‚ÄÚNATURE‚ÄÔS CONFORMITY TO LAW,‚ÄÙ OF WHICH YOU PHYSICISTS TALK SO PROUDLY, AS THOUGH‚ÄÎWHY, IT EXISTS ONLY OWING TO YOUR INTERPRETATION AND BAD ‚ÄÚPHILOLOGY.‚ÄÙ IT IS NO MATTER OF FACT, NO ‚ÄÚTEXT,‚ÄÙ BUT RATHER ONLY A NAIVELY HUMANITARIAN EMENDATION AND PERVERSION OF MEANING, WITH WHICH YOU MAKE ABUNDANT CONCESSIONS TO THE DEMOCRATIC INSTINCTS OF THE MODERN SOUL! ‚ÄÚEVERYWHERE EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW; NATURE IS NO DIFFERENT IN THAT RESPECT, NO BETTER OFF THAN WE ARE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎA FINE INSTANCE OF ULTERIOR MOTIVATION, IN WHICH THE PLEBEIAN ANTAGONISM TO EVERYTHING PRIVILEGED AND AUTOCRATIC AS WELL AS A SECOND AND MORE REFINED ATHEISM ARE DISGUISED ONCE MORE. ‚ÄÚNI DIEU, NI MA√ÆTRE‚ÄÙ25‚ÄÎTHAT IS WHAT YOU, TOO, WANT; AND THEREFORE ‚ÄÚCHEERS FOR THE LAW OF NATURE!‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎIS IT NOT SO? BUT AS SAID ABOVE, THAT IS INTERPRETATION, NOT TEXT; AND SOMEBODY MIGHT COME ALONG WHO, WITH OPPOSITE INTENTIONS AND MODES OF INTERPRETATION, COULD READ OUT OF THE SAME ‚ÄÚNATURE,‚ÄÙ AND WITH REGARD TO THE SAME PHENOMENA, RATHER THE TYRANNICALLY INCONSIDERATE AND RELENTLESS ENFORCEMENT OF CLAIMS OF POWER‚ÄÎAN INTERPRETER WHO WOULD PICTURE THE UNEXCEPTIONAL AND UNCONDITIONAL ASPECTS OF ALL ‚ÄÚWILL TO POWER‚ÄÙ SO VIVIDLY THAT ALMOST EVERY WORD, EVEN THE WORD ‚ÄÚTYRANNY‚ÄÙ ITSELF, WOULD EVENTUALLY SEEM UNSUITABLE, OR A WEAKENING AND ATTENUATING METAPHOR‚ÄÎBEING TOO HUMAN‚ÄÎBUT HE MIGHT, NEVERTHELESS, END BY ASSERTING THE SAME ABOUT THIS WORLD AS YOU DO, NAMELY, THAT IT HAS A ‚ÄÚNECESSARY‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚCALCULABLE‚ÄÙ COURSE, NOT BECAUSE LAWS OBTAIN IN IT, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY LACKING, AND EVERY POWER DRAWS ITS ULTIMATE CONSEQUENCES AT EVERY MOMENT. SUPPOSING THAT THIS ALSO IS ONLY INTERPRETATION ‚ÄÎAND YOU WILL BE EAGER ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS OBJECTION?‚ÄÎWELL, SO MUCH THE BETTER.

ALL PSYCHOLOGY SO FAR HAS GOT STUCK IN MORAL PREJUDICES AND FEARS; IT HAS NOT DARED TO DESCEND INTO THE DEPTHS. TO UNDERSTAND IT AS MORPHOLOGY AND THE DOCTRINE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WILL TO POWER, AS I DO‚ÄÎNOBODY HAS YET COME CLOSE TO DOING THIS EVEN IN THOUGHT‚ÄÎINSOFAR AS IT IS PERMISSIBLE TO RECOGNIZE IN WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN SO FAR A SYMPTOM OF WHAT HAS SO FAR BEEN KEPT SILENT. THE POWER OF MORAL PREJUDICES HAS PENETRATED DEEPLY INTO THE MOST SPIRITUAL WORLD, WHICH WOULD SEEM TO BE THE COLDEST AND MOST DEVOID OF PRESUPPOSITIONS, AND HAS OBVIOUSLY OPERATED IN AN INJURIOUS, INHIBITING, BLINDING, AND DISTORTING MANNER. A PROPER PHYSIO-PSYCHOLOGY HAS TO CONTEND WITH UNCONSCIOUS RESISTANCE IN THE HEART OF THE INVESTIGATOR, IT HAS ‚ÄÚTHE HEART‚ÄÙ AGAINST IT: EVEN A DOCTRINE OF THE RECIPROCAL DEPENDENCE OF THE ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ AND THE ‚ÄÚWICKED‚ÄÙ DRIVES, CAUSES (AS REFINED IMMORALITY) DISTRESS AND AVERSION IN A STILL HALE AND HEARTY CONSCIENCE‚ÄÎSTILL MORE SO, A DOCTRINE OF THE DERIVATION OF ALL GOOD IMPULSES FROM WICKED ONES. IF, HOWEVER, A PERSON SHOULD REGARD EVEN THE AFFECTS OF HATRED, ENVY, COVETOUSNESS, AND THE LUST TO RULE AS CONDITIONS OF LIFE, AS FACTORS WHICH, FUNDAMENTALLY AND ESSENTIALLY, MUST BE PRESENT IN THE GENERAL ECONOMY OF LIFE (AND MUST, THEREFORE, BE FURTHER ENHANCED IF LIFE IS TO BE FURTHER ENHANCED)‚ÄÎHE WILL SUFFER FROM SUCH A VIEW OF THINGS AS FROM SEASICKNESS. AND YET EVEN THIS HYPOTHESIS IS FAR FROM BEING THE STRANGEST AND MOST PAINFUL IN THIS IMMENSE AND ALMOST NEW DOMAIN OF DANGEROUS INSIGHTS; AND THERE ARE IN FACT A HUNDRED GOOD REASONS WHY EVERYONE SHOULD KEEP AWAY FROM IT WHO‚ÄÎCAN.

ON THE OTHER HAND, IF ONE HAS ONCE DRIFTED THERE WITH ONE‚ÄÔS BARK, WELL! ALL RIGHT! LET US CLENCH OUR TEETH! LET US OPEN OUR EYES AND KEEP OUR HAND FIRM ON THE HELM! WE SAIL RIGHT OVER MORALITY, WE CRUSH, WE DESTROY PERHAPS THE REMAINS OF OUR OWN MORALITY BY DARING TO MAKE OUR VOYAGE THERE‚ÄÎBUT WHAT MATTER ARE WE! NEVER YET DID A PROFOUNDER WORLD OF INSIGHT REVEAL ITSELF TO DARING TRAVELLERS AND ADVENTURERS, AND THE PSYCHOLOGIST WHO THUS ‚ÄÚMAKES A SACRIFICE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎIT IS NOT THE SACRIFIZIO DELL INTELLETTO,26 ON THE CONTRARY!‚ÄÎWILL AT LEAST BE ENTITLED TO DEMAND IN RETURN THAT PSYCHOLOGY SHALL BE RECOGNIZED AGAIN27 AS THE QUEEN OF THE SCIENCES, FOR WHOSE SERVICE AND PREPARATION THE OTHER SCIENCES EXIST. FOR PSYCHOLOGY IS NOW AGAIN THE PATH TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS.


1MARIANNE COWAN HAS SUGGESTED IN THE PREFACE TO HER TRANSLATION THAT NIETZSCHE DIVIDED THIS BOOK ‚ÄÚINTO ‚ÄÒARTICLES‚ÄÔ LIKE ARTICLES OF FAITH,‚ÄÙ AND SHE SEES ‚ÄÚIRONY IN THIS.‚ÄÙ BUT THERE IS NO WARRANT FOR RENDERING HAUPTST√ºCK AS ‚ÄÚARTICLE‚ÄÙ: IT MEANS ‚ÄÚMAJOR PART.‚ÄÙ KANT‚ÄÔS CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON AND CRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON ARE BOTH DIVIDED INTO HAUPTST√ºCKE. SO IS NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS OWN HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN. THE TERM IS OBVIOUSLY PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE FOR BOOKS SUBDIVIDED INTO MANY SHORT SECTIONS.

2NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS ATTACK ON THIS FAITH IS PREFIGURED IN THE TITLE OF THE BOOK. THIS APHORISM INVITES COMPARISON WITH THE FIRST APHORISM OF HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN.

6ONE OF KANT‚ÄÔS CENTRAL QUESTIONS WAS, ‚ÄÚHOW ARE SYNTHETIC JUDGMENTS A PRIORI POSSIBLE?‚ÄÙ HE MEANT JUDGMENTS THAT ARE KNOWN FOR CERTAIN TO BE TRUE, INDEPENDENTLY OF EXPERIENCE, BUT NOT BY DEFINITION. HIS EXAMPLES INCLUDE THE JUDGMENT THAT EVERY EVENT HAS A CAUSE. HANS VAIHINGER, A LEADING KANT SCHOLAR WHO PUBLISHED A BOOK ON NIETZSCHE ALS PHILOSOPH (1902; 4TH ED. 1916), LATER PUBLISHED HIS OWN THEORY OF NECESSARY FICTIONS UNDER THE TITLE, DIE PHILOSOPHIE DES ALS-OB (1911; ENGLISH TR. BY C. K. OGDEN, 1924: THE PHILOSOPHY OF ‚ÄÚAS IF‚ÄÙ), DEVOTING THE FINAL CHAPTER TO A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS SIMILAR IDEAS. CF. SECTION 11 BELOW.

7NIETZSCHE IS THINKING OF THE ‚ÄÚGREAT‚ÄÙ PHILOSOPHERS. NOW THAT THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF ‚ÄÚPHILOSOPHERS,‚ÄÙ THESE TEND TO BE MORE AKIN TO THEIR COLLEAGUES IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAN TO THE MEN DISCUSSED HERE.

8THE REFERENCE IS TO EPICURUS‚ÄÔ FRAGMENT 238, AND THE AMBIGUITY IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT DIONYSIUS WAS THE NAME OF THE SICILIAN TYRANT WHOM PLATO HAD TRIED FOR SEVERAL YEARS TO CONVERT TO HIS OWN PHILOSOPHY.

17AFFEKT: I HAVE RENDERED THIS TERM CONSISTENTLY AS ‚ÄÚAFFECT‚ÄÙ: GOOD DICTIONARIES INCLUDE THE RELEVANT MEANINGS. ‚ÄÚFEELING‚ÄÙ COMES CLOSE TO NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS MEANING BUT FAILS TO SUGGEST THE FACT THAT THE TERM IS SOMEWHAT TECHNICAL AND CARRIES OVERTONES OF SPINOZA‚ÄÔS AFFECTUS AND A LONG PHILOSOPHICAL TRADITION. MOREOVER, ‚ÄÚFEELING‚ÄÙ IS NEEDED TO RENDER GEF√ºHL, WHICH OCCURS SEVERAL TIMES IN THIS SECTION.

IN HIS DISCUSSION OF SPINOZA‚ÄÔS AFFECTUS, STUART HAMPSHIRE USES ‚ÄÚAFFECTION‚ÄÙ AND PLACES THE WORD IN QUOTATION MARKS (SPINOZA, BALTIMORE, PENGUIN BOOKS, 1951.). IN JAMES MARK BALDWIN‚ÄÔS DICTIONARY OF PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOLOGY, VOL. I (1901), ‚ÄÚAFFECT‚ÄÙ IS DEFINED AS ‚ÄÚA STIMULUS OR MOTIVE TO ACTION WHICH IS AFFECTIVE (Q.V.) OR FELT, NOT PRESENTED AS AN END,‚ÄÙ A USAGE ‚ÄÚSUGGESTED BY BALDWIN,‚ÄÙ WHILE ‚ÄÚAFFECTION‚ÄÙ IS SUGGESTED AS AN EQUIVALENT OF THE GERMAN AFFEKT, WHICH IS DEFINED AS ‚ÄÚPASSING EMOTIONAL STATES ‚Ä¶ THE BEST WRITERS DISTINGUISH IT FROM PASSION, AS HAVING LESS VEHEMENCE, AND AS LESS DISTINCTLY, IF AT ALL, CONNECTED WITH A SENSUOUS BASIS‚Ä¶. ST. AUGUSTINE, AS QUOTED AND ADOPTED BY AQUINAS, SAYS: THOSE MENTAL STATES (MOTUS ANIMI) WHICH THE GREEKS CALL PATH?, AND CICERO PERTURBATIONES, ARE BY SOME CALLED AFFECTUS, OR AFFECTIONES BY OTHERS, KEEPING TO THE LITERAL RENDERING OF THE GREEK PASSIONES.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

MY REASON FOR PREFERRING ‚ÄÚAFFECT‚ÄÙ TO ‚ÄÚAFFECTION‚ÄÙ IS THAT THE FORMER IS READILY RECOGNIZED AS A TECHNICAL TERM, WHILE THE LATTER IS VERY APT TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD AS SUGGESTING A MILD FORM OF LOVE.

23CF. SARTRE‚ÄÔS FAMOUS DICTUM: ‚ÄÚIF MAN AS THE EXISTENTIALIST SEES HIM IS NOT DEFINABLE, IT IS BECAUSE TO BEGIN WITH HE IS NOTHING. HE WILL NOT BE ANYTHING UNTIL LATER, AND THEN HE WILL BE WHAT HE MAKES OF HIMSELF‚Ä¶. MAN SIMPLY IS. NOT THAT HE IS SIMPLY WHAT HE CONCEIVES HIMSELF TO BE, BUT HE IS WHAT HE WILLS ‚Ä¶ MAN IS NOTHING ELSE BUT THAT WHICH HE MAKES OF HIMSELF. THAT IS THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF EXISTENTIALISM‚Ä¶. BEFORE THAT PROJECTION OF THE SELF NOTHING EXISTS ‚Ä¶ MAN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HE IS. THUS, THE FIRST EFFECT OF EXISTENTIALISM IS THAT IT PUTS EVERY MAN IN POSSESSION OF HIMSELF AS HE IS, AND PLACES THE ENTIRE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS EXISTENCE SQUARELY UPON HIS OWN SHOULDERS‚ÄÙ (‚ÄÚEXISTENTIALISM IS A HUMANISM,‚ÄÙ INCLUDED IN EXISTENTIALISM FROM DOSTOEVSKY TO SARTRE, ED. WALTER KAUFMANN.).

READING THIS WITHOUT KNOWING THAT BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL WAS PUBLISHED IN 1886 AND SARTRE‚ÄÔS LECTURE IN 1946, ONE WOULD SCARCELY GUESS AT NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS IMMENSE INFLUENCE ON EXISTENTIALISM IN GENERAL AND SARTRE IN PARTICULAR; ONE MIGHT EVEN SUPPOSE THAT NIETZSCHE WAS HERE POLEMICIZING AGAINST SARTRE.

O SANCTA SIMPLICITAS!1 IN WHAT STRANGE SIMPLIFICATION AND FALSIFICATION MAN LIVES! ONE CAN NEVER CEASE WONDERING ONCE ONE HAS ACQUIRED EYES FOR THIS MARVEL! HOW WE HAVE MADE EVERYTHING AROUND US CLEAR AND FREE AND EASY AND SIMPLE! HOW WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GIVE OUR SENSES A PASSPORT TO EVERYTHING SUPERFICIAL, OUR THOUGHTS A DIVINE DESIRE FOR WANTON LEAPS AND WRONG INFERENCES! HOW FROM THE BEGINNING WE HAVE CONTRIVED TO RETAIN OUR IGNORANCE IN ORDER TO ENJOY AN ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE FREEDOM, LACK OF SCRUPLE AND CAUTION, HEARTINESS, AND GAIETY OF LIFE‚ÄÎIN ORDER TO ENJOY LIFE! AND ONLY ON THIS NOW SOLID, GRANITE FOUNDATION OF IGNORANCE COULD KNOWLEDGE RISE SO FAR‚ÄÎTHE WILL TO KNOWLEDGE ON THE FOUNDATION OF A FAR MORE POWERFUL WILL: THE WILL TO IGNORANCE, TO THE UNCERTAIN, TO THE UNTRUE! NOT AS ITS OPPOSITE, BUT‚ÄÎAS ITS REFINEMENT!

EVEN IF LANGUAGE, HERE AS ELSEWHERE, WILL NOT GET OVER ITS AWKWARDNESS, AND WILL CONTINUE TO TALK OF OPPOSITES WHERE THERE ARE ONLY DEGREES AND MANY SUBTLETIES OF GRADATION; EVEN IF THE INVETERATE TARTUFFERY OF MORALS, WHICH NOW BELONGS TO OUR UNCONQUERABLE ‚ÄÚFLESH AND BLOOD,‚ÄÙ INFECTS THE WORDS EVEN OF THOSE OF US WHO KNOW BETTER‚ÄÎHERE AND THERE WE UNDERSTAND IT AND LAUGH AT THE WAY IN WHICH PRECISELY SCIENCE AT ITS BEST SEEKS MOST TO KEEP US IN THIS SIMPLIFIED, THOROUGHLY ARTIFICIAL, SUITABLY CONSTRUCTED AND SUITABLY FALSIFIED WORLD‚ÄÎAT THE WAY IN WHICH, WILLY-NILLY, IT LOVES ERROR, BECAUSE, BEING ALIVE, IT LOVES LIFE.

AFTER SUCH A CHEERFUL COMMENCEMENT, A SERIOUS WORD WOULD LIKE TO BE HEARD; IT APPEALS TO THE MOST SERIOUS. TAKE CARE, PHILOSOPHERS AND FRIENDS, OF KNOWLEDGE, AND BEWARE OF MARTYRDOM! OF SUFFERING ‚ÄÚFOR THE TRUTH‚ÄÔS SAKE‚ÄÙ! EVEN OF DEFENDING YOURSELVES! IT SPOILS ALL THE INNOCENCE AND FINE NEUTRALITY OF YOUR CONSCIENCE; IT MAKES YOU HEADSTRONG AGAINST OBJECTIONS AND RED RAGS; IT STUPEFIES, ANIMALIZES, AND BRUTALIZES WHEN IN THE STRUGGLE WITH DANGER, SLANDER, SUSPICION, EXPULSION, AND EVEN WORSE CONSEQUENCES OF HOSTILITY, YOU HAVE TO POSE AS PROTECTORS OF TRUTH UPON EARTH‚ÄÎAS THOUGH ‚ÄÚTHE TRUTH‚ÄÙ WERE SUCH AN INNOCUOUS AND INCOMPETENT CREATURE AS TO REQUIRE PROTECTORS! AND YOU OF ALL PEOPLE, YOU KNIGHTS OF THE MOST SORROWFUL COUNTENANCE,2 DEAR LOAFERS AND COBWEB-SPINNERS OF THE SPIRIT! AFTER ALL, YOU KNOW WELL ENOUGH THAT IT CANNOT BE OF ANY CONSEQUENCE IF YOU OF ALL PEOPLE ARE PROVED RIGHT; YOU KNOW THAT NO PHILOSOPHER SO FAR HAS BEEN PROVED RIGHT, AND THAT THERE MIGHT BE A MORE LAUDABLE TRUTHFULNESS IN EVERY LITTLE QUESTION MARK THAT YOU PLACE AFTER YOUR SPECIAL WORDS AND FAVORITE DOCTRINES (AND OCCASIONALLY AFTER YOURSELVES) THAN IN ALL THE SOLEMN GESTURES AND TRUMPS BEFORE ACCUSERS AND LAW COURTS.3 RATHER, GO AWAY. FLEE INTO CONCEALMENT. AND HAVE YOUR MASKS AND SUBTLETY,4 THAT YOU MAY BE MISTAKEN FOR WHAT YOU ARE NOT, OR FEARED A LITTLE. AND DON‚ÄÔT FORGET THE GARDEN, THE GARDEN WITH GOLDEN TRELLISWORK. AND HAVE PEOPLE AROUND YOU WHO ARE AS A GARDEN‚ÄÎOR AS MUSIC ON THE WATERS IN THE EVENING, WHEN THE DAY IS TURNING INTO MEMORIES. CHOOSE THE GOOD SOLITUDE, THE FREE, PLAYFUL, LIGHT SOLITUDE THAT GIVES YOU, TOO, THE RIGHT TO REMAIN GOOD IN SOME SENSE. HOW POISONOUS, HOW CRAFTY, HOW BAD, DOES EVERY LONG WAR MAKE ONE, THAT CANNOT BE WAGED OPENLY BY MEANS OF FORCE! HOW PERSONAL DOES A LONG FEAR MAKE ONE, A LONG WATCHING OF ENEMIES, OF POSSIBLE ENEMIES! THESE OUTCASTS OF SOCIETY, THESE LONG-PURSUED, WICKEDLY PERSECUTED ONES‚ÄÎALSO THE COMPULSORY RECLUSES, THE SPINOZAS OR GIORDANO BRUNOS‚ÄÎALWAYS BECOME IN THE END, EVEN UNDER THE MOST SPIRITUAL MASQUERADE, AND PERHAPS WITHOUT BEING THEMSELVES AWARE OF IT, SOPHISTICATED VENGEANCE-SEEKERS AND POISON-BREWERS (LET SOMEONE LAY BARE THE FOUNDATION OF SPINOZA‚ÄÔS ETHICS AND THEOLOGY!), NOT TO SPEAK OF THE STUPIDITY OF MORAL INDIGNATION, WHICH IS THE UNFAILING SIGN IN A PHILOSOPHER THAT HIS PHILOSOPHICAL SENSE OF HUMOR HAS LEFT HIM. THE MARTYRDOM OF THE PHILOSOPHER, HIS ‚ÄÚSACRIFICE FOR THE SAKE OF TRUTH,‚ÄÙ FORCES INTO THE LIGHT WHATEVER OF THE AGITATOR AND ACTOR LURKS IN HIM; AND IF ONE HAS SO FAR CONTEMPLATED HIM ONLY WITH ARTISTIC CURIOSITY, WITH REGARD TO MANY A PHILOSOPHER IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE DANGEROUS DESIRE TO SEE HIM ALSO IN HIS DEGENERATION (DEGENERATED INTO A ‚ÄÚMARTYR,‚ÄÙ INTO A STAGE- AND PLATFORM-BAWLER). ONLY, THAT IT IS NECESSARY WITH SUCH A DESIRE TO BE CLEAR WHAT SPECTACLE ONE WILL SEE IN ANY CASE‚ÄÎMERELY A SATYR PLAY, MERELY AN EPILOGUE FARCE, MERELY THE CONTINUED PROOF THAT THE LONG, REAL TRAGEDY IS AT AN END, ASSUMING THAT EVERY PHILOSOPHY WAS IN ITS GENESIS A LONG TRAGEDY.

EVERY CHOICE HUMAN BEING STRIVES INSTINCTIVELY FOR A CITADEL AND A SECRECY WHERE HE IS SAVED FROM THE CROWD, THE MANY, THE GREAT MAJORITY‚ÄÎWHERE HE MAY FORGET ‚ÄÚMEN WHO ARE THE RULE,‚ÄÙ BEING THEIR EXCEPTION‚ÄÎEXCEPTING ONLY THE ONE CASE IN WHICH HE IS PUSHED STRAIGHT TO SUCH MEN BY A STILL STRONGER INSTINCT, AS A SEEKER AFTER KNOWLEDGE IN THE GREAT AND EXCEPTIONAL SENSE. ANYONE WHO, IN INTERCOURSE WITH MEN, DOES NOT OCCASIONALLY GLISTEN IN ALL THE COLORS OF DISTRESS, GREEN AND GRAY WITH DISGUST, SATIETY, SYMPATHY, GLOOMINESS, AND LONELINESS, IS CERTAINLY NOT A MAN OF ELEVATED TASTES; SUPPOSING, HOWEVER, THAT HE DOES NOT TAKE ALL THIS BURDEN AND DISGUST UPON HIMSELF VOLUNTARILY, THAT HE PERSISTENTLY AVOIDS IT, AND REMAINS, AS I SAID, QUIETLY AND PROUDLY HIDDEN IN HIS CITADEL, ONE THING IS CERTAIN: HE WAS NOT MADE, HE WAS NOT PREDESTINED, FOR KNOWLEDGE. IF HE WERE, HE WOULD ONE DAY HAVE TO SAY TO HIMSELF: ‚ÄÚTHE DEVIL TAKE MY GOOD TASTE! BUT THE RULE IS MORE INTERESTING THAN THE EXCEPTION‚ÄÎTHAN MYSELF, THE EXCEPTION!‚ÄÙ AND HE WOULD GO DOWN,5 AND ABOVE ALL, HE WOULD GO ‚ÄÚINSIDE.‚ÄÙ

THE LONG AND SERIOUS STUDY OF THE AVERAGE MAN, AND CONSEQUENTLY MUCH DISGUISE, SELF-OVERCOMING, FAMILIARITY, AND BAD CONTACT (ALL CONTACT IS BAD CONTACT EXCEPT WITH ONE‚ÄÔS EQUALS)‚ÄÎTHIS CONSTITUTES A NECESSARY PART OF THE LIFE-HISTORY OF EVERY PHILOSOPHER, PERHAPS THE MOST DISAGREEABLE, ODIOUS, AND DISAPPOINTING PART. IF HE IS FORTUNATE, HOWEVER, AS A FAVORITE CHILD OF KNOWLEDGE SHOULD BE, HE WILL ENCOUNTER SUITABLE SHORTCUTS AND HELPS FOR HIS TASK; I MEAN SO-CALLED CYNICS, THOSE WHO SIMPLY RECOGNIZE THE ANIMAL, THE COMMONPLACE, AND ‚ÄÚTHE RULE‚ÄÙ IN THEMSELVES, AND AT THE SAME TIME STILL HAVE THAT DEGREE OF SPIRITUALITY AND THAT ITCH WHICH MAKES THEM TALK OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR LIKES BEFORE WITNESSES‚ÄÎSOMETIMES THEY EVEN WALLOW IN BOOKS, AS ON THEIR OWN DUNG.

CYNICISM IS THE ONLY FORM IN WHICH BASE SOULS APPROACH HONESTY; AND THE HIGHER MAN MUST LISTEN CLOSELY TO EVERY COARSE OR SUBTLE CYNICISM, AND CONGRATULATE HIMSELF WHEN A CLOWN WITHOUT SHAME OR A SCIENTIFIC SATYR SPEAKS OUT PRECISELY IN FRONT OF HIM.

THERE ARE EVEN CASES WHERE ENCHANTMENT MIXES WITH THE DISGUST‚ÄÎNAMELY, WHERE BY A FREAK OF NATURE GENIUS IS TIED TO SOME SUCH INDISCREET BILLYGOAT AND APE, AS IN THE CASE OF THE ABB√© GALIANI,6 THE PROFOUNDEST, MOST CLEAR-SIGHTED, AND PERHAPS ALSO FILTHIEST MAN OF HIS CENTURY‚ÄÎHE WAS FAR PROFOUNDER THAN VOLTAIRE AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO A GOOD DEAL MORE TACITURN. IT HAPPENS MORE FREQUENTLY, AS HAS BEEN HINTED, THAT A SCIENTIFIC HEAD IS PLACED ON AN APE‚ÄÔS BODY, A SUBTLE EXCEPTIONAL UNDERSTANDING IN A BASE SOUL, AN OCCURRENCE BY NO MEANS RARE, ESPECIALLY AMONG DOCTORS AND PHYSIOLOGISTS OF MORALITY. AND WHENEVER ANYONE SPEAKS WITHOUT BITTERNESS, QUITE INNOCENTLY, OF MAN AS A BELLY WITH TWO REQUIREMENTS, AND A HEAD WITH ONE; WHENEVER ANYONE SEES, SEEKS, AND WANTS TO SEE ONLY HUNGER, SEXUAL LUST, AND VANITY AS THE REAL AND ONLY MOTIVES OF HUMAN ACTIONS; IN SHORT, WHEN ANYONE SPEAKS ‚ÄÚBADLY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND NOT EVEN ‚ÄÚWICKEDLY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎOF MAN, THE LOVER OF KNOWLEDGE SHOULD LISTEN SUBTLY AND DILIGENTLY; HE SHOULD ALTOGETHER HAVE AN OPEN EAR WHEREVER PEOPLE TALK WITHOUT INDIGNATION. FOR THE INDIGNANT AND WHOEVER PERPETUALLY TEARS AND LACERATES WITH HIS OWN TEETH HIMSELF (OR AS A SUBSTITUTE, THE WORLD, OR GOD, OR SOCIETY) MAY INDEED, MORALLY SPEAKING, STAND HIGHER THAN THE LAUGHING AND SELF-SATISFIED SATYR, BUT IN EVERY OTHER SENSE THEY ARE A MORE ORDINARY, MORE INDIFFERENT, AND LESS INSTRUCTIVE CASE. AND NO ONE LIES AS MUCH AS THE INDIGNANT DO.

IT IS HARD TO BE UNDERSTOOD, ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE THINKS AND LIVES GƑÅNGƑÅSROTAGATI7 AMONG MEN WHO THINK AND LIVE DIFFERENTLY‚ÄÎNAMELY, K≈´RMAGATI,8 OR AT BEST ‚ÄÚTHE WAY FROGS WALK,‚ÄÙ MA·ΠÁ·∏Ç≈´KAGATI9 (I OBVIOUSLY DO EVERYTHING TO BE ‚ÄÚHARD TO UNDERSTAND‚ÄÙ MYSELF!)‚ÄÎAND ONE SHOULD BE CORDIALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE GOOD WILL TO SOME SUBTLETY OF INTERPRETATION. AS REGARDS ‚ÄÚTHE GOOD FRIENDS,‚ÄÙ HOWEVER, WHO ARE ALWAYS TOO LAZY AND THINK THAT AS FRIENDS THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO RELAX, ONE DOES WELL TO GRANT THEM FROM THE OUTSET SOME LEEWAY AND ROMPING PLACE FOR MISUNDERSTANDING: THEN ONE CAN EVEN LAUGH‚ÄÎOR GET RID OF THEM ALTOGETHER, THESE GOOD FRIENDS‚ÄÎAND ALSO LAUGH.

WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT TO RENDER FROM ONE LANGUAGE INTO ANOTHER IS THE TEMPO OF ITS STYLE, WHICH HAS ITS BASIS IN THE CHARACTER OF THE RACE, OR TO SPEAK MORE PHYSIOLOGICALLY, IN THE AVERAGE TEMPO OF ITS METABOLISM. THERE ARE HONESTLY MEANT TRANSLATIONS THAT, AS INVOLUNTARY VULGARIZATIONS, ARE ALMOST FALSIFICATIONS OF THE ORIGINAL, MERELY BECAUSE ITS BOLD AND MERRY TEMPO (WHICH LEAPS OVER AND OBVIATES ALL DANGERS IN THINGS AND WORDS) COULD NOT BE TRANSLATED. A GERMAN IS ALMOST INCAPABLE OF PRESTO10 IN HIS LANGUAGE; THUS ALSO, AS MAY BE REASONABLY INFERRED, OF MANY OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL AND DARING NUANCES OF FREE, FREE-SPIRITED THOUGHT. AND JUST AS THE BUFFOON AND SATYR ARE FOREIGN TO HIM IN BODY AND CONSCIENCE, SO ARISTOPHANES AND PETRONIUS ARE UNTRANSLATABLE FOR HIM. EVERYTHING PONDEROUS, VISCOUS, AND SOLEMNLY CLUMSY, ALL LONG-WINDED AND BORING TYPES OF STYLE ARE DEVELOPED IN PROFUSE VARIETY AMONG GERMANS‚ÄÎFORGIVE ME THE FACT THAT EVEN GOETHE‚ÄÔS PROSE, IN ITS MIXTURE OF STIFFNESS AND ELEGANCE, IS NO EXCEPTION, BEING A REFLECTION OF THE ‚ÄÚGOOD OLD TIME‚ÄÙ TO WHICH IT BELONGS, AND A REFLECTION OF GERMAN TASTE AT A TIME WHEN THERE STILL WAS A ‚ÄÚGERMAN TASTE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎA ROCOCO TASTE IN MORIBUS ET ARTIBUS.11

LESSING IS AN EXCEPTION, OWING TO HIS HISTRIONIC NATURE WHICH UNDERSTOOD MUCH AND UNDERSTOOD HOW TO DO MANY THINGS. HE WAS NOT THE TRANSLATOR OF BAYLE FOR NOTHING AND LIKED TO FLEE TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF DIDEROT AND VOLTAIRE, AND BETTER YET THAT OF THE ROMAN COMEDY WRITERS. IN TEMPO, TOO, LESSING LOVED FREE THINKING AND ESCAPE FROM GERMANY. BUT HOW COULD THE GERMAN LANGUAGE, EVEN IN THE PROSE OF A LESSING, IMITATE THE TEMPO OF MACHIAVELLI,12 WHO IN HIS PRINCIPE [THE PRINCE] LETS US BREATHE THE DRY, REFINED AIR OF FLORENCE AND CANNOT HELP PRESENTING THE MOST SERIOUS MATTERS IN A BOISTEROUS ALLEGRISSIMO,13 PERHAPS NOT WITHOUT A MALICIOUS ARTISTIC SENSE OF THE CONTRAST HE RISKS‚ÄÎLONG, DIFFICULT, HARD, DANGEROUS THOUGHTS AND THE TEMPO OF THE GALLOP AND THE VERY BEST, MOST CAPRICIOUS HUMOR?

WHO, FINALLY, COULD VENTURE ON A GERMAN TRANSLATION OF PETRONIUS, WHO, MORE THAN ANY GREAT MUSICIAN SO FAR, WAS A MASTER OF PRESTO IN INVENTION, IDEAS, AND WORDS? WHAT DO THE SWAMPS OF THE SICK, WICKED WORLD, EVEN THE ‚ÄÚANCIENT WORLD,‚ÄÙ MATTER IN THE END, WHEN ONE HAS THE FEET OF A WIND AS HE DID, THE RUSH, THE BREATH, THE LIBERATING SCORN OF A WIND THAT MAKES EVERYTHING HEALTHY BY MAKING EVERYTHING RUN! AND AS FOR ARISTOPHANES‚ÄÎTHAT TRANSFIGURING, COMPLEMENTARY SPIRIT FOR WHOSE SAKE ONE FORGIVES EVERYTHING HELLENIC FOR HAVING EXISTED, PROVIDED ONE HAS UNDERSTOOD IN ITS FULL PROFUNDITY ALL THAT NEEDS TO BE FORGIVEN AND TRANSFIGURED HERE‚ÄÎTHERE IS NOTHING THAT HAS CAUSED ME TO MEDITATE MORE ON PLATO‚ÄÔS SECRECY AND SPHINX NATURE THAN THE HAPPILY PRESERVED PETIT FAIT14 THAT UNDER THE PILLOW OF HIS DEATHBED THERE WAS FOUND NO ‚ÄÚBIBLE,‚ÄÙ NOR ANYTHING EGYPTIAN, PYTHAGOREAN, OR PLATONIC‚ÄÎBUT A VOLUME OF ARISTOPHANES. HOW COULD EVEN PLATO HAVE ENDURED LIFE‚ÄÎA GREEK LIFE HE REPUDIATED‚ÄÎWITHOUT AN ARISTOPHANES?

INDEPENDENCE IS FOR THE VERY FEW; IT IS A PRIVILEGE OF THE STRONG. AND WHOEVER ATTEMPTS IT EVEN WITH THE BEST RIGHT BUT WITHOUT INNER CONSTRAINT PROVES THAT HE IS PROBABLY NOT ONLY STRONG, BUT ALSO DARING TO THE POINT OF RECKLESSNESS. HE ENTERS INTO A LABYRINTH, HE MULTIPLIES A THOUSANDFOLD THE DANGERS WHICH LIFE BRINGS WITH IT IN ANY CASE, NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS THAT NO ONE CAN SEE HOW AND WHERE HE LOSES HIS WAY, BECOMES LONELY, AND IS TORN PIECEMEAL BY SOME MINOTAUR OF CONSCIENCE. SUPPOSING ONE LIKE THAT COMES TO GRIEF, THIS HAPPENS SO FAR FROM THE COMPREHENSION OF MEN THAT THEY NEITHER FEEL IT NOR SYMPATHIZE. AND HE CANNOT GO BACK ANY LONGER. NOR CAN HE GO BACK TO THE PITY OF MEN.‚ÄÎ

OUR HIGHEST INSIGHTS MUST‚ÄÎAND SHOULD‚ÄÎSOUND LIKE FOLLIES AND SOMETIMES LIKE CRIMES WHEN THEY ARE HEARD WITHOUT PERMISSION BY THOSE WHO ARE NOT PREDISPOSED AND PREDESTINED FOR THEM.15 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EXOTERIC AND THE ESOTERIC, FORMERLY KNOWN TO PHILOSOPHERS‚ÄÎAMONG THE INDIANS AS AMONG THE GREEKS, PERSIANS, AND MUSLIMS, IN SHORT, WHEREVER ONE BELIEVED IN AN ORDER OF RANK AND NOT IN EQUALITY AND EQUAL RIGHTS‚ÄÎDOES NOT SO MUCH CONSIST IN THIS, THAT THE EXOTERIC APPROACH COMES FROM OUTSIDE AND SEES, ESTIMATES, MEASURES, AND JUDGES FROM THE OUTSIDE, NOT THE INSIDE: WHAT IS MUCH MORE ESSENTIAL IS THAT THE EXOTERIC APPROACH SEES THINGS FROM BELOW, THE ESOTERIC LOOKS DOWN FROM ABOVE. THERE ARE HEIGHTS OF THE SOUL FROM WHICH EVEN TRAGEDY CEASES TO LOOK TRAGIC; AND ROLLING TOGETHER ALL THE WOE OF THE WORLD‚ÄÎWHO COULD DARE TO DECIDE WHETHER ITS SIGHT WOULD NECESSARILY SEDUCE US AND COMPEL US TO FEEL PITY AND THUS DOUBLE THIS WOE?

WHAT SERVES THE HIGHER TYPE OF MEN AS NOURISHMENT OR DELECTATION MUST ALMOST BE POISON FOR A VERY DIFFERENT AND INFERIOR TYPE. THE VIRTUES OF THE COMMON MAN MIGHT PERHAPS SIGNIFY VICES AND WEAKNESSES IN A PHILOSOPHER. IT COULD BE POSSIBLE THAT A MAN OF A HIGH TYPE, WHEN DEGENERATING AND PERISHING, MIGHT ONLY AT THAT POINT ACQUIRE QUALITIES THAT WOULD REQUIRE THOSE IN THE LOWER SPHERE INTO WHICH HE HAD SUNK TO BEGIN TO VENERATE HIM LIKE A SAINT. THERE ARE BOOKS THAT HAVE OPPOSITE VALUES FOR SOUL AND HEALTH, DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE LOWER SOUL, THE LOWER VITALITY, OR THE HIGHER AND MORE VIGOROUS ONES TURN TO THEM: IN THE FORMER CASE, THESE BOOKS ARE DANGEROUS AND LEAD TO CRUMBLING AND DISINTEGRATION; IN THE LATTER, HERALDS‚ÄÔ CRIES THAT CALL THE BRAVEST TO THEIR COURAGE. BOOKS FOR ALL THE WORLD ARE ALWAYS FOUL-SMELLING BOOKS: THE SMELL OF SMALL PEOPLE CLINGS TO THEM. WHERE THE PEOPLE EAT AND DRINK, EVEN WHERE THEY VENERATE, IT USUALLY STINKS. ONE SHOULD NOT GO TO CHURCH IF ONE WANTS TO BREATHE PURE AIR.

WHEN ONE IS YOUNG, ONE VENERATES AND DESPISES WITHOUT THAT ART OF NUANCES WHICH CONSTITUTES THE BEST GAIN OF LIFE, AND IT IS ONLY FAIR THAT ONE HAS TO PAY DEARLY FOR HAVING ASSAULTED MEN AND THINGS IN THIS MANNER WITH YES AND NO. EVERYTHING IS ARRANGED SO THAT THE WORST OF TASTES, THE TASTE FOR THE UNCONDITIONAL, SHOULD BE CRUELLY FOOLED AND ABUSED UNTIL A MAN LEARNS TO PUT A LITTLE ART INTO HIS FEELINGS AND RATHER TO RISK TRYING EVEN WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL‚ÄÎAS THE REAL ARTISTS OF LIFE DO.

THE WRATHFUL AND REVERENT ATTITUDES CHARACTERISTIC OF YOUTH DO NOT SEEM TO PERMIT THEMSELVES ANY REST UNTIL THEY HAVE FORGED MEN AND THINGS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THESE ATTITUDES MAY BE VENTED ON THEM‚ÄÎAFTER ALL, YOUTH IN ITSELF HAS SOMETHING OF FORGERY AND DECEPTION. LATER, WHEN THE YOUNG SOUL, TORTURED BY ALL KINDS OF DISAPPOINTMENTS, FINALLY TURNS SUSPICIOUSLY AGAINST ITSELF, STILL HOT AND WILD, EVEN IN ITS SUSPICION AND PANGS OF CONSCIENCE‚ÄÎHOW WROTH IT IS WITH ITSELF NOW! HOW IT TEARS ITSELF TO PIECES, IMPATIENTLY! HOW IT TAKES REVENGE FOR ITS LONG SELF-DELUSION, JUST AS IF IT HAD BEEN A DELIBERATE BLINDNESS! IN THIS TRANSITION ONE PUNISHES ONESELF WITH MISTRUST AGAINST ONE‚ÄÔS OWN FEELINGS; ONE TORTURES ONE‚ÄÔS OWN ENTHUSIASM WITH DOUBTS; INDEED, ONE EXPERIENCES EVEN A GOOD CONSCIENCE AS A DANGER, AS IF IT WERE A WAY OF WRAPPING ONESELF IN VEILS AND THE EXHAUSTION OF SUBTLER HONESTY‚ÄÎAND ABOVE ALL ONE TAKES SIDES, TAKES SIDES ON PRINCIPLE, AGAINST ‚ÄÚYOUTH.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTEN YEARS LATER ONE COMPREHENDS THAT ALL THIS, TOO‚ÄÎWAS STILL YOUTH.

DURING THE LONGEST PART OF HUMAN HISTORY‚ÄÎSO-CALLED PREHISTORICAL TIMES‚ÄÎTHE VALUE OR DISVALUE OF AN ACTION WAS DERIVED FROM ITS CONSEQUENCES. THE ACTION ITSELF WAS CONSIDERED AS LITTLE AS ITS ORIGIN. IT WAS RATHER THE WAY A DISTINCTION OR DISGRACE STILL REACHES BACK TODAY FROM A CHILD TO ITS PARENTS, IN CHINA: IT WAS THE RETROACTIVE FORCE OF SUCCESS OR FAILURE THAT LED MEN TO THINK WELL OR ILL OF AN ACTION. LET US CALL THIS PERIOD THE PRE-MORAL PERIOD OF MANKIND: THE IMPERATIVE ‚ÄÚKNOW THYSELF!‚ÄÙ WAS AS YET UNKNOWN.

IN THE LAST TEN THOUSAND YEARS, HOWEVER, ONE HAS REACHED THE POINT, STEP BY STEP, IN A FEW LARGE REGIONS ON THE EARTH, WHERE IT IS NO LONGER THE CONSEQUENCES BUT THE ORIGIN OF AN ACTION THAT ONE ALLOWS TO DECIDE ITS VALUE. ON THE WHOLE THIS IS A GREAT EVENT WHICH INVOLVES A CONSIDERABLE REFINEMENT OF VISION AND STANDARDS; IT IS THE UNCONSCIOUS AFTEREFFECT OF THE RULE OF ARISTOCRATIC VALUES AND THE FAITH IN ‚ÄÚDESCENT‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHE SIGN OF A PERIOD THAT ONE MAY CALL MORAL IN THE NARROWER SENSE. IT INVOLVES THE FIRST ATTEMPT AT SELF-KNOWLEDGE. INSTEAD OF THE CONSEQUENCES, THE ORIGIN: INDEED A REVERSAL OF PERSPECTIVE! SURELY, A REVERSAL ACHIEVED ONLY AFTER LONG STRUGGLES AND VACILLATIONS. TO BE SURE, A CALAMITOUS NEW SUPERSTITION, AN ODD NARROWNESS OF INTERPRETATION, THUS BECOME DOMINANT: THE ORIGIN OF AN ACTION WAS INTERPRETED IN THE MOST DEFINITE SENSE AS ORIGIN IN AN INTENTION; ONE CAME TO AGREE THAT THE VALUE OF AN ACTION LAY IN THE VALUE OF THE INTENTION. THE INTENTION AS THE WHOLE ORIGIN AND PREHISTORY OF AN ACTION‚ÄÎALMOST TO THE PRESENT DAY THIS PREJUDICE DOMINATED MORAL PRAISE, BLAME, JUDGMENT, AND PHILOSOPHY ON EARTH.

BUT TODAY‚ÄÎSHOULDN‚ÄÔT WE HAVE REACHED THE NECESSITY OF ONCE MORE RESOLVING ON A REVERSAL AND FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN VALUES, OWING TO ANOTHER SELF-EXAMINATION OF MAN, ANOTHER GROWTH IN PROFUNDITY? DON‚ÄÔT WE STAND AT THE THRESHOLD OF A PERIOD WHICH SHOULD BE DESIGNATED NEGATIVELY, TO BEGIN WITH, AS EXTRA-MORAL? AFTER ALL, TODAY AT LEAST WE IMMORALISTS HAVE THE SUSPICION THAT THE DECISIVE VALUE OF AN ACTION LIES PRECISELY IN WHAT IS UNINTENTIONAL IN IT, WHILE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT THAT IS INTENTIONAL, EVERYTHING ABOUT IT THAT CAN BE SEEN, KNOWN, ‚ÄÚCONSCIOUS,‚ÄÙ STILL BELONGS TO ITS SURFACE AND SKIN‚ÄÎWHICH, LIKE EVERY SKIN, BETRAYS SOMETHING BUT CONCEALS EVEN MORE. IN SHORT, WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTENTION IS MERELY A SIGN AND SYMPTOM THAT STILL REQUIRES INTERPRETATION‚ÄÎMOREOVER, A SIGN THAT MEANS TOO MUCH AND THEREFORE, TAKEN BY ITSELF ALONE, ALMOST NOTHING. WE BELIEVE THAT MORALITY IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE, THE MORALITY OF INTENTIONS, WAS A PREJUDICE, PRECIPITATE AND PERHAPS PROVISIONAL ‚ÄÎSOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF ASTROLOGY AND ALCHEMY‚ÄÎBUT IN ANY CASE SOMETHING THAT MUST BE OVERCOME. THE OVERCOMING OF MORALITY, IN A CERTAIN SENSE EVEN THE SELF-OVERCOMING OF MORALITY‚ÄÎLET THIS BE THE NAME FOR THAT LONG SECRET WORK WHICH HAS BEEN SAVED UP FOR THE FINEST AND MOST HONEST, ALSO THE MOST MALICIOUS, CONSCIENCES OF TODAY, AS LIVING TOUCHSTONES OF THE SOUL.





33


THERE IS NO OTHER WAY: THE FEELINGS OF DEVOTION, SELF-SACRIFICE FOR ONE‚ÄÔS NEIGHBOR, THE WHOLE MORALITY OF SELF-DENIAL MUST BE QUESTIONED MERCILESSLY AND TAKEN TO COURT‚ÄÎNO LESS THAN THE AESTHETICS OF ‚ÄÚCONTEMPLATION DEVOID OF ALL INTEREST‚ÄÙ WHICH IS USED TODAY AS A SEDUCTIVE GUISE FOR THE EMASCULATION OF ART, TO GIVE IT A GOOD CONSCIENCE. THERE IS TOO MUCH CHARM AND SUGAR IN THESE FEELINGS OF ‚ÄÚFOR OTHERS,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚNOT FOR MYSELF,‚ÄÙ FOR US NOT TO NEED TO BECOME DOUBLY SUSPICIOUS AT THIS POINT AND TO ASK: ‚ÄÚARE THESE NOT PERHAPS‚ÄÎSEDUCTIONS?‚ÄÙ

THAT THEY PLEASE‚ÄÎTHOSE WHO HAVE THEM AND THOSE WHO ENJOY THEIR FRUITS, AND ALSO THE MERE SPECTATOR‚ÄÎTHIS DOES NOT YET CONSTITUTE AN ARGUMENT IN THEIR FAVOR BUT RATHER INVITES CAUTION. SO LET US BE CAUTIOUS.





34


WHATEVER PHILOSOPHICAL STANDPOINT ONE MAY ADOPT TODAY, FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW THE ERRONEOUSNESS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE THINK WE LIVE IS THE SUREST AND FIRMEST FACT THAT WE CAN LAY EYES ON: WE FIND REASONS UPON REASONS FOR IT WHICH WOULD LIKE TO LURE US TO HYPOTHESES CONCERNING A DECEPTIVE PRINCIPLE IN ‚ÄÚTHE ESSENCE OF THINGS.‚ÄÙ BUT WHOEVER HOLDS OUR THINKING ITSELF, ‚ÄÚTHE SPIRIT,‚ÄÙ IN OTHER WORDS, RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FALSENESS OF THE WORLD‚ÄÎAN HONORABLE WAY OUT WHICH IS CHOSEN BY EVERY CONSCIOUS OR UNCONSCIOUS ADVOCATUS DEI16‚ÄÎWHOEVER TAKES THIS WORLD, ALONG WITH SPACE, TIME, FORM, MOVEMENT, TO BE FALSELY INFERRED‚ÄÎANYONE LIKE THAT WOULD AT LEAST HAVE AMPLE REASON TO LEARN TO BE SUSPICIOUS AT LONG LAST OF ALL THINKING. WOULDN‚ÄÔT THINKING HAVE PUT OVER ON US THE BIGGEST HOAX YET? AND WHAT WARRANT WOULD THERE BE THAT IT WOULD NOT CONTINUE TO DO WHAT IT HAS ALWAYS DONE?

IN ALL SERIOUSNESS: THE INNOCENCE OF OUR THINKERS IS SOMEHOW TOUCHING AND EVOKES REVERENCE, WHEN TODAY THEY STILL STEP BEFORE CONSCIOUSNESS WITH THE REQUEST THAT IT SHOULD PLEASE GIVE THEM HONEST ANSWERS; FOR EXAMPLE, WHETHER IT IS ‚ÄÚREAL,‚ÄÙ AND WHY IT SO RESOLUTELY KEEPS THE EXTERNAL WORLD AT A DISTANCE, AND OTHER QUESTIONS OF THAT KIND. THE FAITH IN ‚ÄÚIMMEDIATE CERTAINTIES‚ÄÙ IS A MORAL NA√ØVET√© THAT REFLECTS HONOR ON US PHILOSOPHERS; BUT‚ÄÎAFTER ALL WE SHOULD NOT BE ‚ÄÚMERELY MORAL‚ÄÙ MEN. APART FROM MORALITY, THIS FAITH IS A STUPIDITY THAT REFLECTS LITTLE HONOR ON US. IN BOURGEOIS LIFE EVER-PRESENT SUSPICION MAY BE CONSIDERED A SIGN OF ‚ÄÚBAD CHARACTER‚ÄÙ AND HENCE BELONG AMONG THINGS IMPRUDENT; HERE, AMONG US, BEYOND THE BOURGEOIS WORLD AND ITS YES AND NO‚ÄÎWHAT SHOULD PREVENT US FROM BEING IMPRUDENT AND SAYING: A PHILOSOPHER HAS NOTHING LESS THAN A RIGHT TO ‚ÄÚBAD CHARACTER,‚ÄÙ AS THE BEING WHO HAS SO FAR ALWAYS BEEN FOOLED BEST ON EARTH; HE HAS A DUTY TO SUSPICION TODAY, TO SQUINT MALICIOUSLY OUT OF EVERY ABYSS OF SUSPICION.

FORGIVE ME THE JOKE OF THIS GLOOMY GRIMACE AND TROPE; FOR I MYSELF HAVE LEARNED LONG AGO TO THINK DIFFERENTLY, TO ESTIMATE DIFFERENTLY WITH REGARD TO DECEIVING AND BEING DECEIVED, AND I KEEP IN RESERVE AT LEAST A COUPLE OF JOSTLES FOR THE BLIND RAGE WITH WHICH THE PHILOSOPHERS RESIST BEING DECEIVED. WHY NOT? IT IS NO MORE THAN A MORAL PREJUDICE THAT TRUTH IS WORTH MORE THAN MERE APPEARANCE; IT IS EVEN THE WORST PROVED ASSUMPTION THERE IS IN THE WORLD. LET AT LEAST THIS MUCH BE ADMITTED: THERE WOULD BE NO LIFE AT ALL IF NOT ON THE BASIS OF PERSPECTIVE ESTIMATES AND APPEARANCES; AND IF, WITH THE VIRTUOUS ENTHUSIASM AND CLUMSINESS OF SOME PHILOSOPHERS, ONE WANTED TO ABOLISH THE ‚ÄÚAPPARENT WORLD‚ÄÙ ALTOGETHER‚ÄÎWELL, SUPPOSING YOU COULD DO THAT, AT LEAST NOTHING WOULD BE LEFT OF YOUR ‚ÄÚTRUTH‚ÄÙ EITHER. INDEED, WHAT FORCES US AT ALL TO SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS AN ESSENTIAL OPPOSITION OF ‚ÄÚTRUE‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚFALSE‚ÄÙ? IS IT NOT SUFFICIENT TO ASSUME DEGREES OF APPARENTNESS AND, AS IT WERE, LIGHTER AND DARKER SHADOWS AND SHADES OF APPEARANCE‚ÄÎDIFFERENT ‚ÄÚVALUES,‚ÄÙ TO USE THE LANGUAGE OF PAINTERS? WHY COULDN‚ÄÔT THE WORLD THAT CONCERNS US‚ÄÎBE A FICTION? AND IF SOMEBODY ASKED, ‚ÄÚBUT TO A FICTION THERE SURELY BELONGS AN AUTHOR?‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎCOULDN‚ÄÔT ONE ANSWER SIMPLY: WHY? DOESN‚ÄÔT THIS ‚ÄÚBELONGS‚ÄÙ PERHAPS BELONG TO THE FICTION, TOO? IS IT NOT PERMITTED TO BE A BIT IRONICAL ABOUT THE SUBJECT NO LESS THAN THE PREDICATE AND OBJECT? SHOULDN‚ÄÔT PHILOSOPHERS BE PERMITTED TO RISE ABOVE FAITH IN GRAMMAR? ALL DUE RESPECT FOR GOVERNESSES‚ÄÎBUT HASN‚ÄÔT THE TIME COME FOR PHILOSOPHY TO RENOUNCE THE FAITH OF GOVERNESSES?17





35


O VOLTAIRE! O HUMANENESS! O NONSENSE! THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT ‚ÄÚTRUTH,‚ÄÙ ABOUT THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH; AND WHEN A HUMAN BEING IS TOO HUMAN ABOUT IT‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚIL NE CHERCHE LE VRAI QUE POUR FAIRE LE BIEN‚ÄÙ18‚ÄÎI BET HE FINDS NOTHING.





36


SUPPOSE NOTHING ELSE WERE ‚ÄÚGIVEN‚ÄÙ AS REAL EXCEPT OUR WORLD OF DESIRES AND PASSIONS, AND WE COULD NOT GET DOWN, OR UP, TO ANY OTHER ‚ÄÚREALITY‚ÄÙ BESIDES THE REALITY OF OUR DRIVES‚ÄÎFOR THINKING IS MERELY A RELATION OF THESE DRIVES TO EACH OTHER: IS IT NOT PERMITTED TO MAKE THE EXPERIMENT AND TO ASK THE QUESTION WHETHER THIS ‚ÄÚGIVEN‚ÄÙ WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR ALSO UNDERSTANDING ON THE BASIS OF THIS KIND OF THING THE SO-CALLED MECHANISTIC (OR ‚ÄÚMATERIAL‚ÄÙ) WORLD? I MEAN, NOT AS A DECEPTION, AS ‚ÄÚMERE APPEARANCE,‚ÄÙ AN ‚ÄÚIDEA‚ÄÙ (IN THE SENSE OF BERKELEY AND SCHOPENHAUER) BUT AS HOLDING THE SAME RANK OF REALITY AS OUR AFFECT‚ÄÎAS A MORE PRIMITIVE FORM OF THE WORLD OF AFFECTS IN WHICH EVERYTHING STILL LIES CONTAINED IN A POWERFUL UNITY BEFORE IT UNDERGOES RAMIFICATIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ORGANIC PROCESS (AND, AS IS ONLY FAIR, ALSO BECOMES TENDERER AND WEAKER)‚ÄÎAS A KIND OF INSTINCTIVE LIFE IN WHICH ALL ORGANIC FUNCTIONS ARE STILL SYNTHETICALLY INTERTWINED ALONG WITH SELF-REGULATION, ASSIMILATION, NOURISHMENT, EXCRETION, AND METABOLISM‚ÄÎAS A PRE-FORM OF LIFE.

IN THE END NOT ONLY IS IT PERMITTED TO MAKE THIS EXPERIMENT; THE CONSCIENCE OF METHOD DEMANDS IT. NOT TO ASSUME SEVERAL KINDS OF CAUSALITY UNTIL THE EXPERIMENT OF MAKING DO WITH A SINGLE ONE HAS BEEN PUSHED TO ITS UTMOST LIMIT (TO THE POINT OF NONSENSE, IF I MAY SAY SO)‚ÄÎTHAT IS A MORAL OF METHOD WHICH ONE MAY NOT SHIRK TODAY‚ÄÎIT FOLLOWS ‚ÄÚFROM ITS DEFINITION,‚ÄÙ AS A MATHEMATICIAN WOULD SAY. THE QUESTION IS IN THE END WHETHER WE REALLY RECOGNIZE THE WILL AS EFFICIENT, WHETHER WE BELIEVE IN THE CAUSALITY OF THE WILL: IF WE DO‚ÄÎAND AT BOTTOM OUR FAITH IN THIS IS NOTHING LESS THAN OUR FAITH IN CAUSALITY ITSELF‚ÄÎTHEN WE HAVE TO MAKE THE EXPERIMENT OF POSITING THE CAUSALITY OF THE WILL HYPOTHETICALLY AS THE ONLY ONE. ‚ÄÚWILL,‚ÄÙ OF COURSE, CAN AFFECT ONLY ‚ÄÚWILL‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND NOT ‚ÄÚMATTER‚ÄÙ (NOT ‚ÄÚNERVES,‚ÄÙ FOR EXAMPLE). IN SHORT, ONE HAS TO RISK THE HYPOTHESIS WHETHER WILL DOES NOT AFFECT WILL WHEREVER ‚ÄÚEFFECTS‚ÄÙ ARE RECOGNIZED‚ÄÎAND WHETHER ALL MECHANICAL OCCURRENCES ARE NOT, INSOFAR AS A FORCE IS ACTIVE IN THEM, WILL FORCE, EFFECTS OF WILL.

SUPPOSE, FINALLY, WE SUCCEEDED IN EXPLAINING OUR ENTIRE INSTINCTIVE LIFE AS THE DEVELOPMENT AND RAMIFICATION OF ONE BASIC FORM OF THE WILL‚ÄÎNAMELY, OF THE WILL TO POWER, AS MY PROPOSITION HAS IT; SUPPOSE ALL ORGANIC FUNCTIONS COULD BE TRACED BACK TO THIS WILL TO POWER AND ONE COULD ALSO FIND IN IT THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF PROCREATION AND NOURISHMENT‚ÄÎIT IS ONE PROBLEM‚ÄÎTHEN ONE WOULD HAVE GAINED THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE ALL EFFICIENT FORCE UNIVOCALLY AS‚ÄÎWILL TO POWER. THE WORLD VIEWED FROM INSIDE, THE WORLD DEFINED AND DETERMINED ACCORDING TO ITS ‚ÄÚINTELLIGIBLE CHARACTER‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎIT WOULD BE ‚ÄÚWILL TO POWER‚ÄÙ AND NOTHING ELSE.‚ÄÎ

‚ÄÚWHAT? DOESN‚ÄÔT THIS MEAN, TO SPEAK WITH THE VULGAR: GOD IS REFUTED, BUT THE DEVIL IS NOT?‚ÄÙ ON THE CONTRARY! ON THE CONTRARY, MY FRIENDS. AND, THE DEVIL‚ÄÎWHO FORCES YOU TO SPEAK WITH THE VULGAR?

WHAT HAPPENED MOST RECENTLY IN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT OF MODERN TIMES IN THE CASE OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION‚ÄÎTHAT GRUESOME FARCE WHICH, CONSIDERED CLOSELY, WAS QUITE SUPERFLUOUS, THOUGH NOBLE AND ENTHUSIASTIC SPECTATORS FROM ALL OVER EUROPE CONTEMPLATED IT FROM A DISTANCE AND INTERPRETED IT ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN INDIGNATIONS AND ENTHUSIASMS FOR SO LONG, AND SO PASSIONATELY, THAT THE TEXT FINALLY DISAPPEARED UNDER THE INTERPRETATION‚ÄÎCOULD HAPPEN ONCE MORE AS A NOBLE POSTERITY MIGHT MISUNDERSTAND THE WHOLE PAST AND IN THAT WAY ALONE MAKE IT TOLERABLE TO LOOK AT.

OR RATHER: ISN‚ÄÔT THIS WHAT HAS HAPPENED EVEN NOW? HAVEN‚ÄÔT WE OURSELVES BEEN THIS ‚ÄÚNOBLE POSTERITY‚ÄÙ? AND ISN‚ÄÔT NOW PRECISELY THE MOMENT WHEN, INSOFAR AS WE COMPREHEND THIS, IT IS ALL OVER?

NOBODY IS VERY LIKELY TO CONSIDER A DOCTRINE TRUE MERELY BECAUSE IT MAKES PEOPLE HAPPY OR VIRTUOUS‚ÄÎEXCEPT PERHAPS THE LOVELY ‚ÄÚIDEALISTS‚ÄÙ WHO BECOME EFFUSIVE ABOUT THE GOOD, THE TRUE, AND THE BEAUTIFUL AND ALLOW ALL KINDS OF MOTLEY, CLUMSY, AND BENEVOLENT DESIDERATA TO SWIM AROUND IN UTTER CONFUSION IN THEIR POND. HAPPINESS AND VIRTUE ARE NO ARGUMENTS. BUT PEOPLE LIKE TO FORGET‚ÄÎEVEN SOBER SPIRITS‚ÄÎTHAT MAKING UNHAPPY AND EVIL ARE NO COUNTERARGUMENTS. SOMETHING MIGHT BE TRUE WHILE BEING HARMFUL AND DANGEROUS IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE. INDEED, IT MIGHT BE A BASIC CHARACTERISTIC OF EXISTENCE THAT THOSE WHO WOULD KNOW IT COMPLETELY WOULD PERISH, IN WHICH CASE THE STRENGTH OF A SPIRIT SHOULD BE MEASURED ACCORDING TO HOW MUCH OF THE ‚ÄÚTRUTH‚ÄÙ ONE COULD STILL BARELY ENDURE‚ÄÎOR TO PUT IT MORE CLEARLY, TO WHAT DEGREE ONE WOULD REQUIRE IT TO BE THINNED DOWN, SHROUDED, SWEETENED, BLUNTED, FALSIFIED.19

BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT THE EVIL AND UNHAPPY ARE MORE FAVORED WHEN IT COMES TO THE DISCOVERY OF CERTAIN PARTS OF TRUTH, AND THAT THE PROBABILITY OF THEIR SUCCESS HERE IS GREATER‚ÄÎNOT TO SPEAK OF THE EVIL WHO ARE HAPPY, A SPECIES THE MORALISTS BURY IN SILENCE. PERHAPS HARDNESS AND CUNNING FURNISH MORE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR THE ORIGIN OF THE STRONG, INDEPENDENT SPIRIT AND PHILOSOPHER THAN THAT GENTLE, FINE, CONCILIATORY GOOD-NATUREDNESS AND ART OF TAKING THINGS LIGHTLY WHICH PEOPLE PRIZE, AND PRIZE RIGHTLY, IN A SCHOLAR. ASSUMING FIRST OF ALL THAT THE CONCEPT ‚ÄÚPHILOSOPHER‚ÄÙ IS NOT RESTRICTED TO THE PHILOSOPHER WHO WRITES BOOKS‚ÄÎOR MAKES BOOKS OF HIS PHILOSOPHY.

A FINAL TRAIT FOR THE IMAGE OF THE FREE-SPIRITED PHILOSOPHER IS CONTRIBUTED BY STENDHAL WHOM, CONSIDERING GERMAN TASTE, I DO NOT WANT TO FAIL TO STRESS‚ÄÎFOR HE GOES AGAINST THE GERMAN TASTE. ‚ÄÚPOUR √™TRE BON PHILOSOPHE,‚ÄÙ SAYS THIS LAST GREAT PSYCHOLOGIST, ‚ÄÚIL FAUT √™TRE SEC, CLAIR, SANS ILLUSION. UN BANQUIER, QUI A FAIT FORTUNE, A UNE PARTIE DU CARACT√®RE REQUIS POUR FAIRE DES D√©COUVERTES EN PHILOSOPHIE, C‚ÄÔEST-A-DIRE POUR VOIR CLAIR DANS CE QUI EST.‚ÄÙ20

WHATEVER IS PROFOUND LOVES MASKS; WHAT IS MOST PROFOUND EVEN HATES IMAGE AND PARABLE. MIGHT NOT NOTHING LESS THAN THE OPPOSITE BE THE PROPER DISGUISE FOR THE SHAME OF A GOD?21 A QUESTIONABLE QUESTION: IT WOULD BE ODD IF SOME MYSTIC HAD NOT RISKED SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT IN HIS MIND. THERE ARE OCCURRENCES OF SUCH A DELICATE NATURE THAT ONE DOES WELL TO COVER THEM UP WITH SOME RUDENESS TO CONCEAL THEM; THERE ARE ACTIONS OF LOVE AND EXTRAVAGANT GENEROSITY AFTER WHICH NOTHING IS MORE ADVISABLE THAN TO TAKE A STICK AND GIVE ANY EYEWITNESS A SOUND THRASHING: THAT WOULD MUDDLE HIS MEMORY. SOME KNOW HOW TO MUDDLE AND ABUSE THEIR OWN MEMORY IN ORDER TO HAVE THEIR REVENGE AT LEAST AGAINST THIS ONLY WITNESS: SHAME IS INVENTIVE.

IT IS NOT THE WORST THINGS THAT CAUSE THE WORST SHAME: THERE IS NOT ONLY GUILE BEHIND A MASK‚ÄÎTHERE IS SO MUCH GRACIOUSNESS IN CUNNING. I COULD IMAGINE THAT A HUMAN BEING WHO HAD TO GUARD SOMETHING PRECIOUS AND VULNERABLE MIGHT ROLL THROUGH LIFE, RUDE AND ROUND AS AN OLD GREEN WINE CASK WITH HEAVY HOOPS: THE REFINEMENT OF HIS SHAME WOULD WANT IT THAT WAY.

A MAN WHOSE SENSE OF SHAME HAS SOME PROFUNDITY ENCOUNTERS HIS DESTINIES AND DELICATE DECISIONS, TOO, ON PATHS WHICH FEW EVER REACH AND OF WHOSE MERE EXISTENCE HIS CLOSEST INTIMATES MUST NOT KNOW: HIS MORTAL DANGER IS CONCEALED FROM THEIR EYES, AND SO IS HIS REGAINED SURENESS OF LIFE. SUCH A CONCEALED MAN WHO INSTINCTIVELY NEEDS SPEECH FOR SILENCE AND FOR BURIAL IN SILENCE AND WHO IS INEXHAUSTIBLE IN HIS EVASION OF COMMUNICATION, WANTS AND SEES TO IT THAT A MASK OF HIM ROAMS IN HIS PLACE THROUGH THE HEARTS AND HEADS OF HIS FRIENDS. AND SUPPOSING HE DID NOT WANT IT, HE WOULD STILL REALIZE SOME DAY THAT IN SPITE OF THAT A MASK OF HIM IS THERE‚ÄÎAND THAT THIS IS WELL. EVERY PROFOUND SPIRIT NEEDS A MASK: EVEN MORE, AROUND EVERY PROFOUND SPIRIT A MASK IS GROWING CONTINUALLY, OWING TO THE CONSTANTLY FALSE, NAMELY SHALLOW, INTERPRETATION OF EVERY WORD, EVERY STEP, EVERY SIGN OF LIFE HE GIVES.22‚ÄÎ

ONE HAS TO TEST ONESELF TO SEE THAT ONE IS DESTINED FOR INDEPENDENCE AND COMMAND‚ÄÎAND DO IT AT THE RIGHT TIME. ONE SHOULD NOT DODGE ONE‚ÄÔS TESTS, THOUGH THEY MAY BE THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME ONE COULD PLAY AND ARE TESTS THAT ARE TAKEN IN THE END BEFORE NO WITNESS OR JUDGE BUT OURSELVES.

NOT TO REMAIN STUCK TO A PERSON‚ÄÎNOT EVEN THE MOST LOVED‚ÄÎEVERY PERSON IS A PRISON, ALSO A NOOK.23 NOT TO REMAIN STUCK TO A FATHERLAND‚ÄÎNOT EVEN IF IT SUFFERS MOST AND NEEDS HELP MOST‚ÄÎIT IS LESS DIFFICULT TO SEVER ONE‚ÄÔS HEART FROM A VICTORIOUS FATHERLAND. NOT TO REMAIN STUCK TO SOME PITY‚ÄÎNOT EVEN FOR HIGHER MEN INTO WHOSE RARE TORTURE AND HELPLESSNESS SOME ACCIDENT ALLOWED US TO LOOK.24 NOT TO REMAIN STUCK TO A SCIENCE‚ÄÎEVEN IF IT SHOULD LURE US WITH THE MOST PRECIOUS FINDS THAT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SAVED UP PRECISELY FOR US.25 NOT TO REMAIN STUCK TO ONE‚ÄÔS OWN DETACHMENT, TO THAT VOLUPTUOUS REMOTENESS AND STRANGENESS OF THE BIRD WHO FLEES EVER HIGHER TO SEE EVER MORE BELOW HIM‚ÄÎTHE DANGER OF THE FLIER. NOT TO REMAIN STUCK TO OUR OWN VIRTUES AND BECOME AS A WHOLE THE VICTIM OF SOME DETAIL IN US, SUCH AS OUR HOSPITALITY, WHICH IS THE DANGER OF DANGERS FOR SUPERIOR AND RICH SOULS WHO SPEND THEMSELVES LAVISHLY, ALMOST INDIFFERENTLY, AND EXAGGERATE THE VIRTUE OF GENEROSITY INTO A VICE. ONE MUST KNOW HOW TO CONSERVE ONESELF: THE HARDEST TEST OF INDEPENDENCE.

A NEW SPECIES OF PHILOSOPHERS IS COMING UP: I VENTURE TO BAPTIZE THEM WITH A NAME THAT IS NOT FREE OF DANGER. AS I UNRIDDLE THEM, INSOFAR AS THEY ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE UNRIDDLED‚ÄÎFOR IT BELONGS TO THEIR NATURE TO WANT TO REMAIN RIDDLES AT SOME POINT‚ÄÎTHESE PHILOSOPHERS OF THE FUTURE MAY HAVE A RIGHT‚ÄÎIT MIGHT ALSO BE A WRONG‚ÄÎTO BE CALLED ATTEMPTERS.26 THIS NAME ITSELF IS IN THE END A MERE ATTEMPT AND, IF YOU WILL, A TEMPTATION.





43


ARE THESE COMING PHILOSOPHERS NEW FRIENDS OF ‚ÄÚTRUTH‚ÄÙ? THAT IS PROBABLE ENOUGH, FOR ALL PHILOSOPHERS SO FAR HAVE LOVED THEIR TRUTHS. BUT THEY WILL CERTAINLY NOT BE DOGMATISTS. IT MUST OFFEND THEIR PRIDE, ALSO THEIR TASTE, IF THEIR TRUTH IS SUPPOSED TO BE A TRUTH FOR EVERYMAN‚ÄÎWHICH HAS SO FAR BEEN THE SECRET WISH AND HIDDEN MEANING OF ALL DOGMATIC ASPIRATIONS. ‚ÄÚMY JUDGMENT IS MY JUDGMENT‚ÄÙ: NO ONE ELSE IS EASILY ENTITLED TO IT‚ÄÎTHAT IS WHAT SUCH A PHILOSOPHER OF THE FUTURE MAY PERHAPS SAY OF HIMSELF.

ONE MUST SHED THE BAD TASTE OF WANTING TO AGREE WITH MANY. ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ IS NO LONGER GOOD WHEN ONE‚ÄÔS NEIGHBOR MOUTHS IT. AND HOW SHOULD THERE BE A ‚ÄÚCOMMON GOOD‚ÄÙ! THE TERM CONTRADICTS ITSELF: WHATEVER CAN BE COMMON ALWAYS HAS LITTLE VALUE. IN THE END IT MUST BE AS IT IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN: GREAT THINGS REMAIN FOR THE GREAT, ABYSSES FOR THE PROFOUND, NUANCES AND SHUDDERS FOR THE REFINED, AND, IN BRIEF, ALL THAT IS RARE FOR THE RARE.27‚ÄÎ





44


NEED I STILL SAY EXPRESSLY AFTER ALL THIS THAT THEY, TOO, WILL BE FREE, VERY FREE SPIRITS, THESE PHILOSOPHERS OF THE FUTURE‚ÄÎTHOUGH JUST AS CERTAINLY THEY WILL NOT BE MERELY FREE SPIRITS BUT SOMETHING MORE, HIGHER, GREATER, AND THOROUGHLY DIFFERENT THAT DOES NOT WANT TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD AND MISTAKEN FOR SOMETHING ELSE. BUT SAYING THIS I FEEL AN OBLIGATION‚ÄÎALMOST AS MUCH TO THEM AS TO OURSELVES WHO ARE THEIR HERALDS AND PRECURSORS, WE FREE SPIRITS‚ÄÎTO SWEEP AWAY A STUPID OLD PREJUDICE AND MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE LOT OF US: ALL TOO LONG IT HAS CLOUDED THE CONCEPT ‚ÄÚFREE SPIRIT‚ÄÙ LIKE A FOG.

IN ALL THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE, AND IN AMERICA, TOO, THERE NOW IS SOMETHING THAT ABUSES THIS NAME: A VERY NARROW, IMPRISONED, CHAINED TYPE OF SPIRITS WHO WANT JUST ABOUT THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT ACCORDS WITH OUR INTENTIONS AND INSTINCTS‚ÄÎNOT TO SPEAK OF THE FACT THAT REGARDING THE NEW PHILOSOPHERS WHO ARE COMING UP THEY MUST ASSUREDLY BE CLOSED WINDOWS AND BOLTED DOORS. THEY BELONG, BRIEFLY AND SADLY, AMONG THE LEVELERS‚ÄÎTHESE FALSELY SO-CALLED ‚ÄÚFREE SPIRITS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎBEING ELOQUENT AND PROLIFICALLY SCRIBBLING SLAVES OF THE DEMOCRATIC TASTE AND ITS ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS;‚ÄÙ THEY ARE ALL HUMAN BEINGS WITHOUT SOLITUDE, WITHOUT THEIR OWN SOLITUDE, CLUMSY GOOD FELLOWS WHOM ONE SHOULD NOT DENY EITHER COURAGE OR RESPECTABLE DECENCY‚ÄÎONLY THEY ARE UNFREE AND RIDICULOUSLY SUPERFICIAL, ABOVE ALL IN THEIR BASIC INCLINATION TO FIND IN THE FORMS OF THE OLD SOCIETY AS IT HAS EXISTED SO FAR JUST ABOUT THE CAUSE OF ALL HUMAN MISERY AND FAILURE‚ÄÎWHICH IS A WAY OF STANDING TRUTH HAPPILY UPON HER HEAD! WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO STRIVE FOR WITH ALL THEIR POWERS IS THE UNIVERSAL GREEN-PASTURE HAPPINESS OF THE HERD, WITH SECURITY, LACK OF DANGER, COMFORT, AND AN EASIER LIFE FOR EVERYONE; THE TWO SONGS AND DOCTRINES WHICH THEY REPEAT MOST OFTEN ARE ‚ÄÚEQUALITY OF RIGHTS‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚSYMPATHY FOR ALL THAT SUFFERS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND SUFFERING ITSELF THEY TAKE FOR SOMETHING THAT MUST BE ABOLISHED.

WE OPPOSITE MEN, HAVING OPENED OUR EYES AND CONSCIENCE TO THE QUESTION WHERE AND HOW THE PLANT ‚ÄÚMAN‚ÄÙ HAS SO FAR GROWN MOST VIGOROUSLY TO A HEIGHT‚ÄÎWE THINK THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED EVERY TIME UNDER THE OPPOSITE CONDITIONS, THAT TO THIS END THE DANGEROUSNESS OF HIS SITUATION MUST FIRST GROW TO THE POINT OF ENORMITY, HIS POWER OF INVENTION AND SIMULATION (HIS ‚ÄÚSPIRIT‚ÄÙ) HAD TO DEVELOP UNDER PROLONGED PRESSURE AND CONSTRAINT INTO REFINEMENT AND AUDACITY, HIS LIFE-WILL HAD TO BE ENHANCED INTO AN UNCONDITIONAL POWER-WILL. WE THINK THAT HARDNESS, FORCEFULNESS, SLAVERY, DANGER IN THE ALLEY AND THE HEART, LIFE IN HIDING, STOICISM, THE ART OF EXPERIMENT AND DEVILRY OF EVERY KIND, THAT EVERYTHING EVIL, TERRIBLE, TYRANNICAL IN MAN, EVERYTHING IN HIM THAT IS KIN TO BEASTS OF PREY AND SERPENTS, SERVES THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE SPECIES ‚ÄÚMAN‚ÄÙ AS MUCH AS ITS OPPOSITE DOES. INDEED, WE DO NOT EVEN SAY ENOUGH WHEN WE SAY ONLY THAT MUCH; AND AT ANY RATE WE ARE AT THIS POINT, IN WHAT WE SAY AND KEEP SILENT ABOUT, AT THE OTHER END FROM ALL MODERN IDEOLOGY AND HERD DESIDERATA‚ÄÎAS THEIR ANTIPODES PERHAPS?

IS IT ANY WONDER THAT WE ‚ÄÚFREE SPIRITS‚ÄÙ ARE NOT EXACTLY THE MOST COMMUNICATIVE SPIRITS? THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO BETRAY IN EVERY PARTICULAR FROM WHAT A SPIRIT CAN LIBERATE HIMSELF AND TO WHAT HE MAY THEN BE DRIVEN? AND AS FOR THE MEANING OF THE DANGEROUS FORMULA ‚ÄÚBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL,‚ÄÙ WITH WHICH WE AT LEAST GUARD AGAINST BEING MISTAKEN FOR OTHERS: WE ARE SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM ‚ÄÚLIBRESPENSEURS,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚLIBERI PENSATORI,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚFREIDENKER,‚ÄÙ28 AND WHATEVER ELSE ALL THESE GOODLY ADVOCATES OF ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS‚ÄÙ LIKE TO CALL THEMSELVES.

AT HOME, OR AT LEAST HAVING BEEN GUESTS, IN MANY COUNTRIES OF THE SPIRIT; HAVING ESCAPED AGAIN AND AGAIN FROM THE MUSTY AGREEABLE NOOKS INTO WHICH PREFERENCE AND PREJUDICE, YOUTH, ORIGIN, THE ACCIDENTS OF PEOPLE AND BOOKS OR EVEN EXHAUSTION FROM WANDERING SEEMED TO HAVE BANISHED US; FULL OF MALICE AGAINST THE LURES OF DEPENDENCE THAT LIE HIDDEN IN HONORS, OR MONEY, OR OFFICES, OR ENTHUSIASMS OF THE SENSES; GRATEFUL EVEN TO NEED AND VACILLATING SICKNESS BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS RID US FROM SOME RULE AND ITS ‚ÄÚPREJUDICE,‚ÄÙ GRATEFUL TO GOD, DEVIL, SHEEP, AND WORM IN US; CURIOUS TO A VICE, INVESTIGATORS TO THE POINT OF CRUELTY, WITH UNINHIBITED FINGERS FOR THE UNFATHOMABLE, WITH TEETH AND STOMACHS FOR THE MOST INDIGESTIBLE, READY FOR EVERY FEAT THAT REQUIRES A SENSE OF ACUTENESS AND ACUTE SENSES, READY FOR EVERY VENTURE, THANKS TO AN EXCESS OF ‚ÄÚFREE WILL,‚ÄÙ WITH FORE- AND BACK-SOULS INTO WHOSE ULTIMATE INTENTIONS NOBODY CAN LOOK SO EASILY, WITH FORE- AND BACKGROUNDS WHICH NO FOOT IS LIKELY TO EXPLORE TO THE END; CONCEALED UNDER CLOAKS OF LIGHT, CONQUERORS EVEN IF WE LOOK LIKE HEIRS AND PRODIGALS, ARRANGERS AND COLLECTORS FROM MORNING TILL LATE, MISERS OF OUR RICHES AND OUR CRAMMED DRAWERS, ECONOMICAL IN LEARNING AND FORGETTING, INVENTIVE IN SCHEMAS, OCCASIONALLY PROUD OF TABLES OF CATEGORIES, OCCASIONALLY PEDANTS, OCCASIONALLY NIGHT OWLS OF WORK EVEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT; YES, WHEN IT IS NECESSARY EVEN SCARECROWS‚ÄÎAND TODAY IT IS NECESSARY; NAMELY, INSOFAR AS WE ARE BORN, SWORN, JEALOUS FRIENDS OF SOLITUDE, OF OUR OWN MOST PROFOUND, MOST MIDNIGHTLY, MOST MIDDAILY SOLITUDE: THAT IS THE TYPE OF MAN WE ARE, WE FREE SPIRITS! AND PERHAPS YOU HAVE SOMETHING OF THIS, TOO, YOU THAT ARE COMING? YOU NEW PHILOSOPHERS?‚ÄÎ

FAR FROM BEING MERELY PLAYFUL OR CONCERNED WITH STYLE TO THE EXCLUSION OF PHILOSOPHY, THIS SECTION TOUCHES ON A CRUCIAL PROBLEM: NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS TEMPO IS A MAJOR REASON FOR THE LONG DELAY IN HIS RECEPTION AS A PHILOSOPHER; AND THREE QUARTERS OF A CENTURY AFTER THE APPEARANCE OF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL THE TEMPO OF ARTICLES IN BRITISH AND AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL JOURNALS HAD SLOWED DOWN TO THE POINT WHERE MANY PHILOSOPHERS WERE BOUND TO FEEL THAT ANYTHING WRITTEN GƑÅNGƑÅSROTAGATI SIMPLY COULD NOT BE PHILOSOPHY. EVEN WITTGENSTEIN, THOUGH HE HAD NEVER FOLLOWED THE FASHION OF MOVING LIKE THE TORTOISE, HAD AT LEAST PROCEEDED MA·ΠÁ·∏Ç≈´KAGATI.

20‚ÄÚTO BE A GOOD PHILOSOPHER, ONE MUST BE DRY, CLEAR, WITHOUT ILLUSION. A BANKER WHO HAS MADE A FORTUNE HAS ONE CHARACTER TRAIT THAT IS NEEDED FOR MAKING DISCOVERIES IN PHILOSOPHY, THAT IS TO SAY, FOR SEEING CLEARLY INTO WHAT IS.‚ÄÙ

21CF. SECTION 30 ABOVE.

22THIS SECTION IS OBVIOUSLY OF GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR THE STUDENT OF NIETZSCHE: IT SUGGESTS PLAINLY THAT THE SURFACE MEANING NOTED BY SUPERFICIAL BROWSERS OFTEN MASKS NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS REAL MEANING, WHICH IN EXTREME CASES MAY APPROXIMATE THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE WORDS MIGHT SUGGEST TO HASTY READERS. IN THIS SENSE ‚ÄÚBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚWILL TO POWER,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚMASTER MORALITY‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚHARDNESS‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚCRUELTY‚ÄÙ MAY BE MASKS THAT ELICIT REACTIONS QUITE INAPPROPRIATE TO WHAT LIES BEHIND THEM. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES WILL BE FOUND ON LATER PAGES.

KARL JASPERS HAS CALLED ATTENTION TO THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN NIETZSCHE AND KIERKEGAARD AT THIS POINT, IN HIS LECTURE ON KIERKEGAARD AND NIETZSCHE (EXISTENTIALISM FROM DOSTOEVSKY TO SARTRE, ED. KAUFMANN, NEW YORK, MERIDIAN BOOKS, 1956).

25IN GERMAN USAGE, CLASSICAL PHILOLOGY, WHICH NIETZSCHE HAD GIVEN UP IN ORDER TO DEVOTE HIMSELF ENTIRELY TO HIS OWN WRITING, IS A SCIENCE.

26VERSUCHER COULD ALSO MEAN TEMPTERS (WHICH DOES NOT SEEM INTENDED HERE, AT LEAST AS THE PRIMARY MEANING) OR EXPERIMENTERS (WHICH IS MEANT BUT WOULD SPOIL THE TRIPLE PLAY ON WORDS): VERSUCH (ATTEMPT OR EXPERIMENT) AND VERSUCHUNG (TEMPTATION).

27IT IS INTERESTING TO COMPARE THIS CRITIQUE OF DOGMATISM WITH HEGEL‚ÄÔS. HEGEL HAD INSISTED THAT DOGMATISM IS WRONG IN SUPPOSING THAT AN ISOLATED PROPOSITION CAN BE THE FORM OF THE TRUTH; NOTHING IS ACCOMPLISHED BY REPEATING SUCH FORMULATIONS: THEIR SIGNIFICANCE DEPENDS ON THE MEANING ASSIGNED TO THE TERMS AND ON THE CONTEXT; HENCE ONLY THE SYSTEM CAN BE THE FORM OF THE TRUTH.

THE HUMAN SOUL AND ITS LIMITS, THE RANGE OF INNER HUMAN EXPERIENCES REACHED SO FAR, THE HEIGHTS, DEPTHS, AND DISTANCES OF THESE EXPERIENCES, THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE SOUL SO FAR AND ITS AS YET UNEXHAUSTED POSSIBILITIES‚ÄÎTHAT IS THE PREDESTINED HUNTING GROUND FOR A BORN PSYCHOLOGIST AND LOVER OF THE ‚ÄÚGREAT HUNT.‚ÄÙ BUT HOW OFTEN HE HAS TO SAY TO HIMSELF IN DESPAIR: ‚ÄÚONE HUNTER! ALAS, ONLY A SINGLE ONE! AND LOOK AT THIS HUGE FOREST, THIS PRIMEVAL FOREST!‚ÄÙ AND THEN HE WISHES HE HAD A FEW HUNDRED HELPERS AND GOOD, WELL-TRAINED HOUNDS THAT HE COULD DRIVE INTO THE HISTORY OF THE HUMAN SOUL TO ROUND UP HIS GAME. IN VAIN: IT IS PROVED TO HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN, THOROUGHLY AND BITTERLY, HOW HELPERS AND HOUNDS FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT EXCITE HIS CURIOSITY CANNOT BE FOUND. WHAT IS WRONG WITH SENDING SCHOLARS INTO NEW AND DANGEROUS HUNTING GROUNDS, WHERE COURAGE, SENSE, AND SUBTLETY IN EVERY WAY ARE REQUIRED, IS THAT THEY CEASE TO BE OF ANY USE PRECISELY WHERE THE ‚ÄÚGREAT HUNT,‚ÄÙ BUT ALSO THE GREAT DANGER, BEGINS: PRECISELY THERE THEY LOSE THEIR KEEN EYE AND NOSE.

TO FIGURE OUT AND DETERMINE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT KIND OF A HISTORY THE PROBLEM OF SCIENCE AND CONSCIENCE2 HAS SO FAR HAD IN THE SOUL OF HOMINES RELIGIOSI3 ONE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE TO BE AS PROFOUND, AS WOUNDED, AS MONSTROUS AS PASCAL‚ÄÔS INTELLECTUAL CONSCIENCE WAS‚ÄÎAND THEN ONE WOULD STILL NEED THAT VAULTING HEAVEN OF BRIGHT, MALICIOUS SPIRITUALITY THAT WOULD BE CAPABLE OF SURVEYING FROM ABOVE, ARRANGING, AND FORCING INTO FORMULAS THIS SWARM OF DANGEROUS AND PAINFUL EXPERIENCES.

BUT WHO WOULD DO ME THIS SERVICE? BUT WHO WOULD HAVE TIME TO WAIT FOR SUCH SERVANTS? THEY OBVIOUSLY GROW TOO RARELY; THEY ARE SO IMPROBABLE IN ANY AGE. IN THE END ONE HAS TO DO EVERYTHING ONE-SELF IN ORDER TO KNOW A FEW THINGS ONESELF: THAT IS, ONE HAS A LOT TO DO. BUT A CURIOSITY OF MY TYPE REMAINS AFTER ALL THE MOST AGREEABLE OF ALL VICES‚ÄÎSORRY, I MEANT TO SAY: THE LOVE OF TRUTH HAS ITS REWARD IN HEAVEN AND EVEN ON EARTH.‚ÄÎ

THE FAITH DEMANDED, AND NOT INFREQUENTLY ATTAINED, BY ORIGINAL CHRISTIANITY, IN THE MIDST OF A SKEPTICAL AND SOUTHERN FREE-SPIRITED WORLD THAT LOOKED BACK ON, AND STILL, CONTAINED, A CENTURIES-LONG FIGHT BETWEEN PHILOSOPHICAL SCHOOLS, BESIDES THE EDUCATION FOR TOLERANCE GIVEN BY THE IMPERIUM ROMANUM4‚ÄÎTHIS FAITH IS NOT THAT INGENUOUS AND BEARLIKE SUBALTERNS‚ÄÔ FAITH WITH WHICH, SAY, A LUTHER OR A CROMWELL, OR SOME OTHER NORTHERN BARBARIAN OF THE SPIRIT, CLUNG TO HIS GOD AND TO CHRISTIANITY. IT IS MUCH CLOSER TO THE FAITH OF PASCAL, WHICH RESEMBLES IN A GRUESOME MANNER A CONTINUAL SUICIDE OF REASON‚ÄÎA TOUGH, LONG-LIVED, WORMLIKE REASON THAT CANNOT BE KILLED ALL AT ONCE AND WITH A SINGLE STROKE.

FROM THE START, THE CHRISTIAN FAITH IS A SACRIFICE: A SACRIFICE OF ALL FREEDOM, ALL PRIDE, ALL SELF-CONFIDENCE OF THE SPIRIT; AT THE SAME TIME, ENSLAVEMENT AND SELF-MOCKERY, SELF-MUTILATION. THERE IS CRUELTY AND RELIGIOUS PHOENICIANISM IN THIS FAITH WHICH IS EXPECTED OF AN OVER-RIPE, MULTIPLE, AND MUCH-SPOILED CONSCIENCE: IT PRESUPPOSES THAT THE SUBJECTION OF THE SPIRIT HURTS INDESCRIBABLY; THAT THE WHOLE PAST AND THE HABITS OF SUCH A SPIRIT RESIST THE ABSURDISSIMUM5 WHICH ‚ÄÚFAITH‚ÄÙ REPRESENTS TO IT.

MODERN MEN, OBTUSE TO ALL CHRISTIAN NOMENCLATURE, NO LONGER FEEL THE GRUESOME SUPERLATIVE THAT STRUCK A CLASSICAL TASTE IN THE PARADOXICAL FORMULA ‚ÄÚGOD ON THE CROSS.‚ÄÙ NEVER YET AND NOWHERE HAS THERE BEEN AN EQUAL BOLDNESS IN INVERSION, ANYTHING AS HORRIBLE, QUESTIONING, AND QUESTIONABLE AS THIS FORMULA: IT PROMISED A REVALUATION OF ALL THE VALUES OF ANTIQUITY.

IT IS THE ORIENT, DEEP ORIENT, IT IS THE ORIENTAL SLAVE WHO REVENGED HIMSELF IN THIS WAY ON ROME AND ITS NOBLE AND FRIVOLOUS TOLERANCE, ON THE ROMAN ‚ÄÚCATHOLICITY‚ÄÙ OF FAITH. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN NOT FAITH BUT THE FREEDOM FROM FAITH, THAT HALF-STOICAL AND SMILING UNCONCERN WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF FAITH, THAT ENRAGED SLAVES IN THEIR MASTERS‚ÄÎAGAINST THEIR MASTERS. ‚ÄÚENLIGHTENMENT‚ÄÙ ENRAGES: FOR THE SLAVE WANTS THE UNCONDITIONAL; HE UNDERSTANDS ONLY WHAT IS TYRANNICAL, IN MORALS, TOO; HE LOVES AS HE HATES, WITHOUT NUANCE, TO THE DEPTHS, TO THE POINT OF PAIN, OF SICKNESS‚ÄÎHIS ABUNDANT CONCEALED SUFFERING IS ENRAGED AGAINST THE NOBLE TASTE THAT SEEMS TO DENY SUFFERING. NOR WAS SKEPTICISM CONCERNING SUFFERING, AT BOTTOM MERELY A POSE OF ARISTOCRATIC MORALITY, THE LEAST CAUSE OF THE ORIGIN OF THE LAST GREAT SLAVE REBELLION WHICH BEGAN WITH THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.

WHEREVER ON EARTH THE RELIGIOUS NEUROSIS HAS APPEARED WE FIND IT TIED TO THREE DANGEROUS DIETARY DEMANDS: SOLITUDE, FASTING, AND SEXUAL ABSTINENCE. BUT ONE CANNOT DECIDE WITH CERTAINTY WHAT IS CAUSE AND WHAT EFFECT, AND WHETHER ANY RELATION OF CAUSE AND EFFECT IS INVOLVED HERE. THE FINAL DOUBT SEEMS JUSTIFIED BECAUSE AMONG ITS MOST REGULAR SYMPTOMS, AMONG BOTH SAVAGE AND TAME PEOPLES, WE ALSO FIND THE MOST SUDDEN, MOST EXTRAVAGANT VOLUPTUOUSNESS WHICH THEN, JUST AS SUDDENLY, CHANGES INTO A PENITENTIAL SPASM AND DENIAL OF THE WORLD AND WILL‚ÄÎBOTH PERHAPS TO BE INTERPRETED AS MASKED EPILEPSY? BUT NOWHERE SHOULD ONE RESIST INTERPRETATION MORE: NO OTHER TYPE HAS YET BEEN SURROUNDED BY SUCH A LAVISH GROWTH OF NONSENSE AND SUPERSTITION, NO OTHER TYPE SEEMS TO HAVE INTERESTED MEN, EVEN PHILOSOPHERS, MORE. THE TIME HAS COME FOR BECOMING A BIT COLD RIGHT HERE, TO LEARN CAUTION‚ÄÎBETTER YET: TO LOOK AWAY, TO GO AWAY.

EVEN IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE MOST RECENT PHILOSOPHY, THAT OF SCHOPENHAUER, WE FIND, ALMOST AS THE PROBLEM-IN-ITSELF, THIS GRUESOME QUESTION MARK OF THE RELIGIOUS CRISIS AND AWAKENING. HOW IS THE DENIAL OF THE WILL POSSIBLE? HOW IS THE SAINT POSSIBLE? THIS REALLY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE QUESTION OVER WHICH SCHOPENHAUER BECAME A PHILOSOPHER AND BEGAN. AND SO IT WAS A GENUINELY SCHOPENHAUERIAN CONCLUSION WHEN HIS MOST CONVINCED ADHERENT (PERHAPS ALSO THE LAST ONE, AS FAR AS GERMANY IS CONCERNED), NAMELY, RICHARD WAGNER, FINISHED HIS LIFE‚ÄÔS WORK AT PRECISELY THIS POINT AND IN THE END BROUGHT THIS HORRIBLE AND ETERNAL TYPE ON THE STAGE AS KUNDRY, TYPE V√©CU,6 IN THE FLESH‚ÄÎAT THE VERY TIME WHEN THE PSYCHIATRISTS OF ALMOST ALL THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE HAD OCCASION TO STUDY IT AT CLOSE QUARTERS, WHEREVER THE RELIGIOUS NEUROSIS‚ÄÎOR WHAT I CALL ‚ÄÚDAS RELIGI√∂SE WESEN‚ÄÙ7‚ÄÎHAD ITS LATEST EPIDEMIC OUTBREAK AND PAGEANT IN THE ‚ÄÚSALVATION ARMY.‚ÄÙ

LET US ASK WHAT PRECISELY ABOUT THIS WHOLE PHENOMENON OF THE SAINT HAS SEEMED SO ENORMOUSLY INTERESTING TO MEN OF ALL TYPES AND AGES, EVEN TO PHILOSOPHERS. BEYOND ANY DOUBT, IT WAS THE AIR OF THE MIRACULOUS THAT GOES WITH IT‚ÄÎNAMELY, THE IMMEDIATE SUCCESSION OF OPPOSITES, OF STATES OF THE SOUL THAT ARE JUDGED MORALLY IN OPPOSITE WAYS. IT SEEMED PALPABLE THAT A ‚ÄÚBAD MAN‚ÄÙ WAS SUDDENLY TRANSFORMED INTO A ‚ÄÚSAINT,‚ÄÙ A GOOD MAN. THE PSYCHOLOGY WE HAVE HAD SO FAR SUFFERED SHIPWRECK AT THIS POINT: WASN‚ÄÔT THIS CHIEFLY BECAUSE IT HAD PLACED ITSELF UNDER THE DOMINION OF MORALS, BECAUSE IT, TOO, BELIEVED IN OPPOSITE MORAL VALUES AND SAW, READ, INTERPRETED THESE OPPOSITES INTO THE TEXT AND THE FACTS?

WHAT? THE ‚ÄÚMIRACLE‚ÄÙ MERELY A MISTAKE OF INTERPRETATION? A LACK OF PHILOLOGY?

IT SEEMS THAT CATHOLICISM IS MUCH MORE INTIMATELY RELATED TO THE LATIN RACES THAN ALL OF CHRISTIANITY IN GENERAL IS TO US NORTHERNERS‚ÄÎAND UNBELIEF THEREFORE MEANS SOMETHING ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT IN CATHOLIC AND PROTESTANT COUNTRIES: AMONG THEM, A KIND OF REBELLION AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THE RACE, WHILE AMONG US IT IS RATHER A RETURN TO THE SPIRIT (OR ANTI-SPIRIT) OF THE RACE. WE NORTHERNERS ARE UNDOUBTEDLY DESCENDED FROM BARBARIAN RACES, WHICH ALSO SHOWS IN OUR TALENT FOR RELIGION: WE HAVE LITTLE TALENT FOR IT. WE MAY EXCEPT THE CELTS, WHO THEREFORE ALSO FURNISHED THE BEST SOIL FOR THE SPREAD OF THE CHRISTIAN INFECTION TO THE NORTH: IN FRANCE THE CHRISTIAN IDEAL CAME TO FLOURISH AS MUCH AS THE PALE SUN OF THE NORTH PERMITTED IT. HOW STRANGELY PIOUS FOR OUR TASTE ARE EVEN THE MOST RECENT FRENCH SKEPTICS INSOFAR AS THEY HAVE ANY CELTIC BLOOD! HOW CATHOLIC, HOW UN-GERMAN AUGUSTE COMTE‚ÄÔS SOCIOLOGY SMELLS TO US WITH ITS ROMAN LOGIC OF THE INSTINCTS! HOW JESUITICAL THAT GRACIOUS AND CLEVER CICERONE OF PORT-ROYAL, SAINTE-BEUVE, IN SPITE OF ALL HIS HOSTILITY AGAINST THE JESUITS! AND ESPECIALLY ERNEST RENAN: HOW INACCESSIBLE THE LANGUAGE OF SUCH A RENAN SOUNDS TO US NORTHERNERS: AT ONE INSTANT AFTER ANOTHER SOME NOTHING OF RELIGIOUS TENSION UNBALANCES HIS SOUL, WHICH IS, IN THE MORE REFINED SENSE, VOLUPTUOUS AND INCLINED TO STRETCH OUT COMFORTABLY. LET US SPEAK AFTER HIM THESE BEAUTIFUL SENTENCES‚ÄÎAND HOW MUCH MALICE AND HIGH SPIRITS STIR IMMEDIATELY IN OUR PROBABLY LESS BEAUTIFUL AND HARDER, NAMELY MORE GERMAN, SOUL AS A RESPONSE!

‚ÄÚDISONS DONC HARDIMENT QUE LA RELIGION EST UN PRODUIT DE L‚ÄÔHOMME NORMAL, QUE L‚ÄÔHOMME EST LE PLUS DANS LE VRAI QUAND IL EST LE PLUS RELIGIEUX ET LE PLUS ASSUR√© D‚ÄÔUNE DESTIN√©E INFINIE‚Ä¶. C‚ÄÔEST QUAND IL EST BON QU‚ÄÔIL VEUT QUE LA VERTU CORRESPONDE √† UN ORDRE √©TERNEL, C‚ÄÔEST QUAND IL CONTEMPLE LES CHOSES D‚ÄÔUNE MANI√®RE D√©SINT√©RESS√©E QU‚ÄÔIL TROUVE LA MORTE R√©VOLTANTE ET ABSURDE. COMMENT NE PAS SUPPOSER QUE C‚ÄÔEST DANS CES MOMENTS-L√†, QUE L‚ÄÔHOMME VOIT LE MIEUX?‚ÄÙ8

THESE SENTENCES ARE SO UTTERLY ANTIPODAL TO MY EARS AND HABITS THAT ON FINDING THEM MY FIRST WRATH WROTE ON THE MARGIN ‚ÄÚLA NIAISERIE RELIGIEUSE PAR EXCELLENCE!‚ÄÙ BUT MY SUBSEQUENT WRATH ACTUALLY TOOK A FANCY TO THEM‚ÄÎTHESE SENTENCES STANDING TRUTH ON HER HEAD! IT IS SO NEAT, SO DISTINGUISHED TO HAVE ONE‚ÄÔS OWN ANTIPODES!

WHAT IS AMAZING ABOUT THE RELIGIOSITY OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS IS THE ENORMOUS ABUNDANCE OF GRATITUDE IT EXUDES: IT IS A VERY NOBLE TYPE OF MAN THAT CONFRONTS NATURE AND LIFE IN THIS WAY.9

LATER, WHEN THE RABBLE GAINED THE UPPER HAND IN GREECE, FEAR BECAME RAMPANT IN RELIGION, TOO‚ÄÎAND THE GROUND WAS PREPARED FOR CHRISTIANITY.‚ÄÎ

THE PASSION FOR GOD: THERE ARE PEASANT TYPES, SINCERE AND OBTRUSIVE, LIKE LUTHER‚ÄÎTHE WHOLE OF PROTESTANTISM LACKS SOUTHERN DELICATEZZA.10 THERE IS SOMETIMES AN ORIENTAL ECSTASY WORTHY OF A SLAVE WHO, WITHOUT DESERVING IT, HAS BEEN PARDONED AND ELEVATED‚ÄÎFOR EXAMPLE, IN AUGUSTINE, WHO LACKS IN A TRULY OFFENSIVE MANNER ALL NOBILITY OF GESTURES AND DESIRES. THERE IS A WOMANLY TENDERNESS AND LUST THAT PRESSES BASHFULLY AND IGNORANTLY TOWARD A UNIO MYSTICA ET PHYSICA11‚ÄÎAS IN MADAME DE GUYON.12 IN MANY CASES IT APPEARS ODDLY ENOUGH AS A DISGUISE FOR THE PUBERTY OF A GIRL OR YOUTH; HERE AND THERE EVEN AS THE HYSTERIA OF AN OLD MAID, ALSO AS HER FINAL AMBITION‚ÄÎAND IN SEVERAL SUCH INSTANCES THE CHURCH HAS PROCLAIMED THE FEMALE A SAINT.

SO FAR THE MOST POWERFUL HUMAN BEINGS HAVE STILL BOWED WORSHIPFULLY BEFORE THE SAINT AS THE RIDDLE OF SELF-CONQUEST AND DELIBERATE FINAL RENUNCIATION. WHY DID THEY BOW? IN HIM‚ÄÎAND AS IT WERE BEHIND THE QUESTION MARK OF HIS FRAGILE AND MISERABLE APPEARANCE‚ÄÎTHEY SENSED THE SUPERIOR FORCE THAT SOUGHT TO TEST ITSELF IN SUCH A CONQUEST, THE STRENGTH OF THE WILL IN WHICH THEY RECOGNIZED AND HONORED THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND DELIGHT IN DOMINION: THEY HONORED SOMETHING IN THEMSELVES WHEN THEY HONORED THE SAINT. MOREOVER, THE SIGHT OF THE SAINT AWAKENED A SUSPICION IN THEM: SUCH AN ENORMITY OF DENIAL, OF ANTI-NATURE WILL NOT HAVE BEEN DESIRED FOR NOTHING, THEY SAID TO AND ASKED THEMSELVES. THERE MAY BE A REASON FOR IT, SOME VERY GREAT DANGER ABOUT WHICH THE ASCETIC, THANKS TO HIS SECRET COMFORTERS AND VISITORS, MIGHT HAVE INSIDE INFORMATION. IN SHORT, THE POWERFUL OF THE WORLD LEARNED A NEW FEAR BEFORE HIM; THEY SENSED A NEW POWER, A STRANGE, AS YET UNCONQUERED ENEMY‚ÄÎIT WAS THE ‚ÄÚWILL TO POWER‚ÄÙ THAT MADE THEM STOP BEFORE THE SAINT. THEY HAD TO ASK HIM‚ÄÎ

IN THE JEWISH ‚ÄÚOLD TESTAMENT,‚ÄÙ THE BOOK OF DIVINE JUSTICE, THERE ARE HUMAN BEINGS, THINGS, AND SPEECHES IN SO GRAND A STYLE THAT GREEK AND INDIAN LITERATURE HAVE NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH IT. WITH TERROR AND REVERENCE ONE STANDS BEFORE THESE TREMENDOUS REMNANTS OF WHAT MAN ONCE WAS, AND WILL HAVE SAD THOUGHTS ABOUT ANCIENT ASIA AND ITS PROTRUDING LITTLE PENINSULA EUROPE, WHICH WANTS BY ALL MEANS TO SIGNIFY AS AGAINST ASIA THE ‚ÄÚPROGRESS OF MAN.‚ÄÙ TO BE SURE, WHOEVER IS HIMSELF MERELY A MEAGER, TAME DOMESTIC ANIMAL AND KNOWS ONLY THE NEEDS OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS (LIKE OUR EDUCATED PEOPLE OF TODAY, INCLUDING THE CHRISTIANS OF ‚ÄÚEDUCATED‚ÄÙ CHRISTIANITY) HAS NO CAUSE FOR AMAZEMENT OR SORROW AMONG THESE RUINS‚ÄÎTHE TASTE FOR THE OLD TESTAMENT IS A TOUCHSTONE FOR ‚ÄÚGREAT‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚSMALL‚ÄÙ13‚ÄÎPERHAPS HE WILL FIND THE NEW TESTAMENT, THE BOOK OF GRACE, STILL RATHER MORE AFTER HIS HEART (IT CONTAINS A LOT OF THE REAL, TENDER, MUSTY TRUE-BELIEVER AND SMALL-SOUL SMELL). TO HAVE GLUED THIS NEW TESTAMENT, A KIND OF ROCOCO OF TASTE IN EVERY RESPECT, TO THE OLD TESTAMENT TO MAKE ONE BOOK, AS THE ‚ÄÚBIBLE,‚ÄÙ AS ‚ÄÚTHE BOOK PAR EXCELLENCE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT IS PERHAPS THE GREATEST AUDACITY AND ‚ÄÚSIN AGAINST THE SPIRIT‚ÄÙ THAT LITERARY EUROPE HAS ON ITS CONSCIENCE.14

WHY ATHEISM TODAY?‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚTHE FATHER‚ÄÙ IN GOD HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY REFUTED; DITTO, ‚ÄÚTHE JUDGE,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚTHE REWARDER.‚ÄÙ ALSO HIS ‚ÄÚFREE WILL‚ÄÙ: HE DOES NOT HEAR‚ÄÎAND IF HE HEARD HE STILL WOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO HELP. WORST OF ALL: HE SEEMS INCAPABLE OF CLEAR COMMUNICATION: IS HE UNCLEAR?

THIS IS WHAT I FOUND TO BE CAUSES FOR THE DECLINE OF EUROPEAN THEISM, ON THE BASIS OF A GREAT MANY CONVERSATIONS, ASKING AND LISTENING. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE RELIGIOUS INSTINCT IS INDEED IN THE PROCESS OF GROWING POWERFULLY‚ÄÎBUT THE THEISTIC SATISFACTION IT REFUSES WITH DEEP SUSPICION.





54


WHAT IS THE WHOLE OF MODERN PHILOSOPHY DOING AT BOTTOM? SINCE DESCARTES‚ÄÎACTUALLY MORE DESPITE HIM THAN BECAUSE OF HIS PRECEDENT‚ÄÎALL THE PHILOSOPHERS SEEK TO ASSASSINATE THE OLD SOUL CONCEPT, UNDER THE GUISE OF A CRITIQUE OF THE SUBJECT-AND-PREDICATE CONCEPT‚ÄÎWHICH MEANS AN ATTEMPT ON THE LIFE OF THE BASIC PRESUPPOSITION OF THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE. MODERN PHILOSOPHY, BEING AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL SKEPTICISM, IS, COVERTLY OR OVERTLY, ANTI-CHRISTIAN‚ÄÎALTHOUGH, TO SAY THIS FOR THE BENEFIT OF MORE REFINED EARS, BY NO MEANS ANTI-RELIGIOUS.

FOR, FORMERLY, ONE BELIEVED IN ‚ÄÚTHE SOUL‚ÄÙ AS ONE BELIEVED IN GRAMMAR AND THE GRAMMATICAL SUBJECT: ONE SAID, ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÙ IS THE CONDITION, ‚ÄÚTHINK‚ÄÙ IS THE PREDICATE AND CONDITIONED‚ÄÎTHINKING IS AN ACTIVITY TO WHICH THOUGHT MUST SUPPLY A SUBJECT AS CAUSE. THEN ONE TRIED WITH ADMIRABLE PERSEVERANCE AND CUNNING TO GET OUT OF THIS NET‚ÄÎAND ASKED WHETHER THE OPPOSITE MIGHT NOT BE THE CASE: ‚ÄÚTHINK‚ÄÙ THE CONDITION, ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÙ THE CONDITIONED; ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÙ IN THAT CASE ONLY A SYNTHESIS WHICH IS MADE BY THINKING. AT BOTTOM, KANT WANTED TO PROVE THAT, STARTING FROM THE SUBJECT, THE SUBJECT COULD NOT BE PROVED‚ÄÎNOR COULD THE OBJECT: THE POSSIBILITY OF A MERELY APPARENT EXISTENCE OF THE SUBJECT, ‚ÄÚTHE SOUL‚ÄÙ IN OTHER WORDS, MAY NOT ALWAYS HAVE REMAINED STRANGE TO HIM‚ÄÎTHAT THOUGHT WHICH AS VEDANTA PHILOSOPHY EXISTED ONCE BEFORE ON THIS EARTH AND EXERCISED TREMENDOUS POWER.

THERE IS A GREAT LADDER OF RELIGIOUS CRUELTY, WITH MANY RUNGS; BUT THREE OF THESE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT.

ONCE ONE SACRIFICED HUMAN BEINGS TO ONE‚ÄÔS GOD, PERHAPS PRECISELY THOSE WHOM ONE LOVED MOST: THE SACRIFICES OF THE FIRST-BORN IN ALL PREHISTORIC RELIGIONS BELONG HERE, AS WELL AS THE SACRIFICE OF THE EMPEROR TIBERIUS IN THE MITHRAS GROTTO OF THE ISLE OF CAPRI, THAT MOST GRUESOME OF ALL ROMAN ANACHRONISMS.

THEN, DURING THE MORAL EPOCH OF MANKIND, ONE SACRIFICED TO ONE‚ÄÔS GOD ONE‚ÄÔS OWN STRONGEST INSTINCTS, ONE‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚNATURE‚ÄÙ: THIS FESTIVE JOY LIGHTS UP THE CRUEL EYES OF THE ASCETIC, THE ‚ÄÚANTI-NATURAL‚ÄÙ ENTHUSIAST.

FINALLY‚ÄÎWHAT REMAINED TO BE SACRIFICED? AT LONG LAST, DID ONE NOT HAVE TO SACRIFICE FOR ONCE WHATEVER IS COMFORTING, HOLY, HEALING; ALL HOPE, ALL FAITH IN HIDDEN HARMONY, IN FUTURE BLISSES AND JUSTICES? DIDN‚ÄÔT ONE HAVE TO SACRIFICE GOD HIMSELF AND, FROM CRUELTY AGAINST ONESELF, WORSHIP THE STONE, STUPIDITY, GRAVITY, FATE, THE NOTHING? TO SACRIFICE GOD FOR THE NOTHING‚ÄÎTHIS PARADOXICAL, MYSTERY OF THE FINAL CRUELTY WAS RESERVED FOR THE GENERATION THAT IS NOW COMING UP: ALL OF US ALREADY KNOW SOMETHING OF THIS.‚ÄÎ





56


WHOEVER HAS ENDEAVORED WITH SOME ENIGMATIC LONGING, AS I HAVE, TO THINK PESSIMISM THROUGH TO ITS DEPTHS AND TO LIBERATE IT FROM THE HALF-CHRISTIAN, HALF-GERMAN NARROWNESS AND SIMPLICITY IN WHICH IT HAS FINALLY PRESENTED ITSELF TO OUR CENTURY, NAMELY, IN THE FORM OF SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS PHILOSOPHY; WHOEVER HAS REALLY, WITH AN ASIATIC AND SUPRA-ASIATIC EYE, LOOKED INTO, DOWN INTO THE MOST WORLD-DENYING OF ALL POSSIBLE WAYS OF THINKING‚ÄÎBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL AND NO LONGER, LIKE THE BUDDHA AND SCHOPENHAUER, UNDER THE SPELL AND DELUSION OF MORALITY‚ÄÎMAY JUST THEREBY, WITHOUT REALLY MEANING TO DO SO, HAVE OPENED HIS EYES TO THE OPPOSITE IDEAL: THE IDEAL OF THE MOST HIGH-SPIRITED, ALIVE, AND WORLD-AFFIRMING HUMAN BEING WHO HAS NOT ONLY COME TO TERMS AND LEARNED TO GET ALONG WITH WHATEVER WAS AND IS, BUT WHO WANTS TO HAVE WHAT WAS AND IS REPEATED INTO ALL ETERNITY,15 SHOUTING INSATIABLY DA CAPO16‚ÄÎNOT ONLY TO HIMSELF BUT TO THE WHOLE PLAY AND SPECTACLE, AND NOT ONLY TO A SPECTACLE BUT AT BOTTOM TO HIM WHO NEEDS PRECISELY THIS SPECTACLE‚ÄÎAND WHO MAKES IT NECESSARY BECAUSE AGAIN AND AGAIN HE NEEDS HIMSELF‚ÄÎAND MAKES HIMSELF NECESSARY‚ÄÎWHAT? AND THIS WOULDN‚ÄÔT BE‚ÄÎCIRCULUS VITIOSUS DEUS?17





57


WITH THE STRENGTH OF HIS SPIRITUAL EYE AND INSIGHT GROWS DISTANCE AND, AS IT WERE, THE SPACE AROUND MAN: HIS WORLD BECOMES MORE PROFOUND; EVER NEW STARS, EVER NEW RIDDLES AND IMAGES BECOME VISIBLE FOR HIM. PERHAPS EVERYTHING ON WHICH THE SPIRIT‚ÄÔS EYE HAS EXERCISED ITS ACUTENESS AND THOUGHTFULNESS WAS NOTHING BUT AN OCCASION FOR THIS EXERCISE, A PLAYFUL MATTER, SOMETHING FOR CHILDREN AND THOSE WHO ARE CHILDISH. PERHAPS THE DAY WILL COME WHEN THE MOST SOLEMN CONCEPTS WHICH HAVE CAUSED THE MOST FIGHTS AND SUFFERING, THE CONCEPTS ‚ÄÚGOD‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚSIN,‚ÄÙ WILL SEEM NO MORE IMPORTANT TO US THAN A CHILD‚ÄÔS TOY AND A CHILD‚ÄÔS PAIN SEEM TO AN OLD MAN‚ÄÎAND PERHAPS ‚ÄÚTHE OLD MAN‚ÄÙ WILL THEN BE IN NEED OF ANOTHER TOY AND ANOTHER PAIN‚ÄÎSTILL CHILD ENOUGH, AN ETERNAL CHILD!





58


HAS IT EVER BEEN REALLY NOTED TO WHAT EXTENT A GENUINELY RELIGIOUS LIFE (BOTH ITS MICROSCOPIC FAVORITE OCCUPATION OF SELF-EXAMINATION AND THAT TENDER COMPOSURE WHICH CALLS ITSELF ‚ÄÚPRAYER‚ÄÙ AND IS A CONTINUAL READINESS FOR THE ‚ÄÚCOMING OF GOD‚ÄÙ) REQUIRES A LEISURE CLASS, OR HALF-LEISURE‚ÄÎI MEAN LEISURE WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE, FROM WAY BACK, BY BLOOD, TO WHICH THE ARISTOCRATIC FEELING THAT WORK DISGRACES IS NOT ALTOGETHER ALIEN‚ÄÎTHE FEELING THAT IT MAKES SOUL AND BODY COMMON. AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY OUR MODERN, NOISY, TIME-CONSUMING INDUSTRIOUSNESS, PROUD OF ITSELF, STUPIDLY PROUD, EDUCATES AND PREPARES PEOPLE, MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE DOES, PRECISELY FOR ‚ÄÚUNBELIEF.‚ÄÙ

AMONG THOSE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHO NOW LIVE IN GERMANY AT A DISTANCE FROM RELIGION I FIND PEOPLE WHOSE ‚ÄÚFREE-THINKING‚ÄÙ IS OF DIVERSE TYPES AND ORIGINS, BUT ABOVE ALL A MAJORITY OF THOSE IN WHOM INDUSTRIOUSNESS HAS, FROM GENERATION UNTO GENERATION, DISSOLVED THE RELIGIOUS INSTINCTS, SO THEY NO LONGER EVEN KNOW WHAT RELIGIONS ARE GOOD FOR AND MERELY REGISTER THEIR PRESENCE IN THE WORLD WITH A KIND OF DUMB AMAZEMENT. THEY FEEL ABUNDANTLY COMMITTED, THESE GOOD PEOPLE, WHETHER TO THEIR BUSINESS OR TO THEIR PLEASURES, NOT TO SPEAK OF THE ‚ÄÚFATHERLAND‚ÄÙ AND THE NEWSPAPERS AND ‚ÄÚFAMILY OBLIGATIONS‚ÄÙ: IT SEEMS THAT THEY SIMPLY HAVE NO TIME LEFT FOR RELIGION, THE MORE SO BECAUSE IT REMAINS UNCLEAR TO THEM WHETHER IT INVOLVES ANOTHER BUSINESS OR ANOTHER PLEASURE‚ÄÎFOR IT IS NOT POSSIBLE, THEY SAY TO THEMSELVES, THAT ONE GOES TO CHURCH MERELY TO DAMPEN ONE‚ÄÔS GOOD SPIRITS. THEY ARE NOT ENEMIES OF RELIGIOUS CUSTOMS; WHEN PARTICIPATION IN SUCH CUSTOMS IS REQUIRED IN CERTAIN CASES, BY THE STATE, FOR EXAMPLE, THEY DO WHAT IS REQUIRED, AS ONE DOES SO MANY THINGS‚ÄÎWITH A PATIENT AND MODEST SERIOUSNESS AND WITHOUT MUCH CURIOSITY AND DISCOMFORT: THEY SIMPLY LIVE TOO MUCH APART AND OUTSIDE TO FEEL ANY NEED FOR ANY PRO AND CON IN SUCH MATTERS.

THOSE INDIFFERENT IN THIS WAY INCLUDE TODAY THE GREAT MAJORITY OF GERMAN MIDDLE-CLASS PROTESTANTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE GREAT INDUSTRIOUS CENTERS OF TRADE AND TRAFFIC; ALSO THE GREAT MAJORITY OF INDUSTRIOUS SCHOLARS AND THE OTHER ACCESSORIES OF THE UNIVERSITIES (EXCEPTING THE THEOLOGIANS, WHOSE PRESENCE AND POSSIBILITY THERE POSE EVER INCREASING AND EVER SUBTLER RIDDLES FOR A PSYCHOLOGIST). PIOUS OR EVEN MERELY CHURCHLY PEOPLE RARELY HAVE THE SLIGHTEST IDEA HOW MUCH, GOOD WILL‚ÄÎONE MIGHT SAY CAPRICE‚ÄÎIS REQUIRED OF A GERMAN SCHOLAR TODAY IF HE IS TO TAKE THE PROBLEM OF RELIGION SERIOUSLY. ON THE BASIS OF HIS WHOLE TRADE (AND, AS NOTED, ON THE BASIS OF THE TRADELIKE INDUSTRIOUSNESS TO WHICH HE IS COMMITTED BY HIS MODERN CONSCIENCE) HE IS INCLINED TOWARD A SUPERIOR, ALMOST GOOD-NATURED AMUSEMENT IN THE FACE OF RELIGION, OCCASIONALLY MIXED WITH A DASH OF DISDAIN FOR THE ‚ÄÚUNCLEANLINESS‚ÄÙ OF THE SPIRIT WHICH HE ASSUMES WHEREVER A CHURCH IS STILL ACKNOWLEDGED. THE SCHOLAR SUCCEEDS ONLY WITH THE HELP OF HISTORY (NOT ON THE BASIS OF HIS OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE) TO MUSTER A REVERENT SERIOUSNESS AND A CERTAIN SHY CONSIDERATION IN THE FACE OF RELIGION. BUT EVEN IF HE RAISES HIS FEELING INTO REAL GRATITUDE TOWARD IT,18 HE STILL HAS NOT PERSONALLY APPROACHED, NOT EVEN BY A SINGLE STEP, WHAT STILL EXISTS NOW AS CHURCH OR PIETY; PERHAPS EVEN THE OPPOSITE. THE PRACTICAL INDIFFERENCE TOWARD RELIGIOUS MATTERS INTO WHICH HE HAS BEEN BORN AND BROUGHT UP IS GENERALLY SUBLIMATED IN HIM INTO CAUTION AND CLEANLINESS THAT SHUN CONTACT WITH RELIGIOUS MEN AND MATTERS; AND IT MAY BE PRECISELY THE DEPTH OF HIS TOLERANCE AND HUMANITY THAT BIDS HIM DODGE THE SUBTLE DISTRESS INVOLVED IN TOLERANCE.

EVERY AGE HAS ITS OWN DIVINE TYPE OF NA√ØVET√© FOR WHOSE INVENTION OTHER AGES MAY ENVY IT‚ÄÎAND HOW MUCH NA√ØVET√©, VENERABLE, CHILDLIKE, AND BOUNDLESSLY CLUMSY NA√ØVET√© LIES IN THE SCHOLAR‚ÄÔS FAITH IN HIS SUPERIORITY, IN THE GOOD CONSCIENCE OF HIS TOLERANCE, IN THE UNSUSPECTING SIMPLE CERTAINTY WITH WHICH HIS INSTINCT TREATS THE RELIGIOUS MAN AS AN INFERIOR AND LOWER TYPE THAT HE HAS OUTGROWN, LEAVING IT BEHIND, BENEATH HIM‚ÄÎHIM, THAT PRESUMPTUOUS LITTLE DWARF AND RABBLE MAN, THE ASSIDUOUS AND SPEEDY HEAD- AND HANDIWORKER OF ‚ÄÚIDEAS,‚ÄÙ OF ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS‚ÄÙ!





59


ANYONE WHO HAS LOOKED DEEPLY INTO THE WORLD MAY GUESS HOW MUCH WISDOM LIES IN THE SUPERFICIALITY OF MEN. THE INSTINCT THAT PRESERVES THEM TEACHES THEM TO BE FLIGHTY, LIGHT, AND FALSE. HERE AND THERE ONE ENCOUNTERS AN IMPASSIONED AND EXAGGERATED WORSHIP OF ‚ÄÚPURE FORMS,‚ÄÙ AMONG BOTH PHILOSOPHERS AND ARTISTS: LET NOBODY DOUBT THAT WHOEVER STANDS THAT MUCH IN NEED OF THE CULT OF SURFACES MUST AT SOME TIME HAVE REACHED BENEATH THEM WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS.

PERHAPS THERE EVEN EXISTS AN ORDER OF RANK AMONG THESE BURNT CHILDREN, THESE BORN, ARTISTS WHO CAN FIND THE ENJOYMENT OF LIFE ONLY IN THE INTENTION OF FALSIFYING ITS IMAGE (AS IT WERE, IN A LONGWINDED REVENGE ON LIFE): THE DEGREE TO WHICH LIFE HAS BEEN SPOILED FOR THEM MIGHT BE INFERRED FROM THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEY WISH TO SEE ITS IMAGE FALSIFIED, THINNED DOWN, TRANSCENDENTALIZED, DEIFIED‚ÄÎTHE HOMINES RELIGIOSI MIGHT BE INCLUDED AMONG ARTISTS, AS THEIR HIGHEST RANK.

IT IS THE PROFOUND, SUSPICIOUS FEAR OF AN INCURABLE PESSIMISM THAT FORCES WHOLE MILLENNIA TO BURY THEIR TEETH IN AND CLING TO A RELIGIOUS INTERPRETATION OF EXISTENCE: THE FEAR OF THAT INSTINCT WHICH SENSES THAT ONE MIGHT GET A HOLD OF THE TRUTH TOO SOON, BEFORE MAN HAS BECOME STRONG ENOUGH, HARD ENOUGH, ARTIST ENOUGH.

PIETY, THE ‚ÄÚLIFE IN GOD,‚ÄÙ SEEN IN THIS WAY, WOULD APPEAR AS THE SUBTLEST AND FINAL OFFSPRING OF THE FEAR OF TRUTH, AS AN ARTIST‚ÄÔS WORSHIP AND INTOXICATION BEFORE THE MOST CONSISTENT OF ALL FALSIFICATIONS, AS THE WILL TO THE INVERSION OF TRUTH, TO UNTRUTH AT ANY PRICE. IT MAY BE THAT UNTIL NOW THERE HAS BEEN NO MORE POTENT MEANS FOR BEAUTIFYING MAN HIMSELF THAN PIETY: IT CAN TURN MAN INTO SO MUCH ART, SURFACE, PLAY OF COLORS, GRACIOUSNESS THAT HIS SIGHT NO LONGER MAKES ONE SUFFER.‚ÄÎ





60


TO LOVE MAN FOR GOD‚ÄÔS SAKE‚ÄÎTHAT HAS SO FAR BEEN THE NOBLEST AND MOST REMOTE FEELING ATTAINED AMONG MEN. THAT THE LOVE OF MAN IS JUST ONE MORE STUPIDITY AND BRUTISHNESS IF THERE IS NO ULTERIOR INTENT TO SANCTIFY IT; THAT THE INCLINATION TO SUCH LOVE OF MAN MUST RECEIVE ITS MEASURE, ITS SUBTLETY, ITS GRAIN OF SALT AND DASH OF AMBERGRIS FROM SOME HIGHER INCLINATION‚ÄÎWHOEVER THE HUMAN BEING MAY HAVE BEEN WHO FIRST FELT AND ‚ÄÚEXPERIENCED‚ÄÙ THIS, HOWEVER MUCH HIS TONGUE MAY HAVE STUMBLED19 AS IT TRIED TO EXPRESS SUCH D√©LICATESSE, LET HIM REMAIN HOLY AND VENERABLE FOR US FOR ALL TIME AS THE HUMAN BEING WHO HAS FLOWN HIGHEST YET AND GONE ASTRAY MOST BEAUTIFULLY!





61


THE PHILOSOPHER AS WE UNDERSTAND HIM, WE FREE SPIRITS‚ÄÎAS THE MAN OF THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSIBILITY WHO HAS THE CONSCIENCE FOR THE OVER-ALL DEVELOPMENT OF MAN‚ÄÎTHIS PHILOSOPHER WILL MAKE USE OF RELIGIONS FOR HIS PROJECT OF CULTIVATION20 AND EDUCATION, JUST AS HE WILL MAKE USE OF WHATEVER POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC STATES ARE AT HAND. THE SELECTIVE AND CULTIVATING21 INFLUENCE, ALWAYS DESTRUCTIVE AS WELL AS CREATIVE AND FORM-GIVING, WHICH CAN BE EXERTED WITH THE HELP OF RELIGIONS, IS ALWAYS MULTIPLE AND DIFFERENT ACCORDING TO THE SORT OF HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE PLACED UNDER ITS SPELL AND PROTECTION. FOR THE STRONG AND INDEPENDENT WHO ARE PREPARED AND PREDESTINED TO COMMAND AND IN WHOM THE REASON AND ART OF A GOVERNING RACE BECOME INCARNATE, RELIGION IS ONE MORE MEANS FOR OVERCOMING RESISTANCES, FOR THE ABILITY TO RULE‚ÄÎAS A BOND THAT UNITES RULERS AND SUBJECTS AND BETRAYS AND DELIVERS THE CONSCIENCES OF THE LATTER, THAT WHICH IS MOST CONCEALED AND INTIMATE AND WOULD LIKE TO ELUDE OBEDIENCE, TO THE FORMER. AND IF A FEW INDIVIDUALS OF SUCH NOBLE DESCENT ARE INCLINED THROUGH LOFTY SPIRITUALITY TO PREFER A MORE WITHDRAWN AND CONTEMPLATIVE LIFE AND RESERVE FOR THEMSELVES ONLY THE MOST SUBTLE TYPE OF RULE (OVER SELECTED DISCIPLES OR BROTHERS IN SOME ORDER), THEN RELIGION CAN EVEN BE USED AS A MEANS FOR OBTAINING PEACE FROM THE NOISE AND EXERTION OF CRUDER FORMS OF GOVERNMENT, AND PURITY FROM THE NECESSARY DIRT OF ALL POLITICS. THAT IS HOW THE BRAHMINS, FOR EXAMPLE, UNDERSTOOD THINGS: BY MEANS OF A RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION THEY GAVE THEMSELVES THE POWER OF NOMINATING THE KINGS OF THE PEOPLE WHILE THEY THEMSELVES KEPT AND FELT APART AND OUTSIDE, AS MEN OF HIGHER AND SUPRA-ROYAL TASKS.

MEANWHILE RELIGION ALSO GIVES TO SOME OF THE RULED THE INSTRUCTION AND OPPORTUNITY TO PREPARE THEMSELVES FOR FUTURE RULING AND OBEYING: THOSE SLOWLY ASCENDING CLASSES‚ÄÎIN WHICH, THANKS TO FORTUNATE MARITAL CUSTOMS, THE STRENGTH AND JOY OF THE WILL, THE WILL TO SELF-CONTROL IS EVER GROWING‚ÄÎRECEIVE ENOUGH NUDGES AND TEMPTATIONS FROM RELIGION TO WALK THE PATHS TO HIGHER SPIRITUALITY, TO TEST THE FEELINGS OF GREAT SELF-OVERCOMING, OF SILENCE AND SOLITUDE. ASCETICISM AND PURITANISM ARE ALMOST INDISPENSABLE MEANS FOR EDUCATING AND ENNOBLING A RACE THAT WISHES TO BECOME MASTER OVER ITS ORIGINS AMONG THE RABBLE AND THAT WORKS ITS WAY UP TOWARD FUTURE RULE.

TO ORDINARY HUMAN BEINGS, FINALLY‚ÄÎTHE VAST MAJORITY WHO EXIST FOR SERVICE AND THE GENERAL ADVANTAGE, AND WHO MAY EXIST ONLY FOR THAT‚ÄÎRELIGION GIVES AN INESTIMABLE CONTENTMENT WITH THEIR SITUATION AND TYPE, MANIFOLD PEACE OF THE HEART, AN ENNOBLING OF OBEDIENCE, ONE FURTHER HAPPINESS AND SORROW WITH THEIR PEERS AND SOMETHING TRANSFIGURING AND BEAUTIFYING, SOMETHING OF A JUSTIFICATION FOR THE WHOLE EVERYDAY CHARACTER, THE WHOLE LOWLINESS, THE WHOLE HALF-BRUTISH POVERTY OF THEIR SOULS. RELIGION AND RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE SPREAD THE SPLENDOR OF THE SUN OVER SUCH EVER-TOILING HUMAN BEINGS AND MAKE THEIR OWN SIGHT TOLERABLE TO THEM. RELIGION HAS THE SAME EFFECT WHICH AN EPICUREAN PHILOSOPHY HAS ON SUFFERERS OF A HIGHER RANK: IT IS REFRESHING, REFINING, MAKES, AS IT WERE, THE MOST OF SUFFERING, AND IN THE END EVEN SANCTIFIES AND JUSTIFIES. PERHAPS NOTHING IN CHRISTIANITY OR BUDDHISM IS AS VENERABLE AS THEIR ART OF TEACHING EVEN THE LOWLIEST HOW TO PLACE THEMSELVES THROUGH PIETY IN AN ILLUSORY HIGHER ORDER OF THINGS AND THUS TO MAINTAIN THEIR CONTENTMENT WITH THE REAL ORDER, IN WHICH THEIR LIFE IS HARD ENOUGH‚ÄÎAND PRECISELY THIS HARDNESS IS NECESSARY.





62


IN THE END, TO BE SURE‚ÄÎTO PRESENT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ACCOUNT OF THESE RELIGIONS, TOO, AND TO EXPOSE THEIR UNCANNY DANGEROUSNESS‚ÄÎONE ALWAYS PAYS DEARLY AND TERRIBLY WHEN RELIGIONS DO NOT WANT TO BE A MEANS OF EDUCATION AND CULTIVATION IN THE PHILOSOPHER‚ÄÔS HAND BUT INSIST ON HAVING THEIR OWN SOVEREIGN WAY, WHEN THEY THEMSELVES WANT TO BE ULTIMATE ENDS AND NOT MEANS AMONG OTHER MEANS. THERE IS AMONG MEN AS IN EVERY OTHER ANIMAL SPECIES AN EXCESS OF FAILURES, OF THE SICK, DEGENERATING, INFIRM, WHO SUFFER NECESSARILY; THE SUCCESSFUL CASES ARE, AMONG MEN TOO, ALWAYS THE EXCEPTION‚ÄÎAND IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT MAN IS THE AS YET UNDETERMINED ANIMAL, THE RARE EXCEPTION. BUT STILL WORSE: THE HIGHER THE TYPE OF MAN THAT A MAN REPRESENTS, THE GREATER THE IMPROBABILITY THAT HE WILL TURN OUT WELL THE ACCIDENTAL, THE LAW OF ABSURDITY IN THE WHOLE ECONOMY OF MANKIND, MANIFESTS ITSELF MOST HORRIBLY IN ITS DESTRUCTIVE EFFECT ON THE HIGHER MEN WHOSE COMPLICATED CONDITIONS OF LIFE CAN ONLY BE CALCULATED WITH GREAT SUBTLETY AND DIFFICULTY.

WHAT, THEN, IS THE ATTITUDE OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED TWO GREATEST RELIGIONS TOWARD THIS EXCESS OF CASES THAT DID NOT TURN OUT RIGHT? THEY SEEK TO PRESERVE, TO PRESERVE ALIVE WHATEVER CAN POSSIBLY BE PRESERVED; INDEED, AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE, THEY SIDE WITH THESE CASES AS RELIGIONS FOR SUFFERERS; THEY AGREE WITH ALL THOSE WHO SUFFER LIFE LIKE A SICKNESS AND WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY OTHER FEELING ABOUT LIFE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FALSE AND SHOULD BECOME IMPOSSIBLE. EVEN IF THE VERY HIGHEST CREDIT IS GIVEN TO THIS CONSIDERATE AND PRESERVING CARE, WHICH, BESIDES BEING DIRECTED TOWARD ALL THE OTHERS, WAS AND IS ALSO DIRECTED TOWARD THE HIGHEST TYPE OF MAN, THE TYPE THAT SO FAR HAS ALMOST ALWAYS SUFFERED MOST; NEVERTHELESS, IN A TOTAL ACCOUNTING, THE SOVEREIGN RELIGIONS WE HAVE HAD SO FAR ARE AMONG THE CHIEF CAUSES THAT HAVE KEPT THE TYPE ‚ÄÚMAN‚ÄÙ ON A LOWER RUNG‚ÄÎTHEY HAVE PRESERVED TOO MUCH OF WHAT OUGHT TO PERISH. WHAT WE HAVE TO THANK THEM FOR IS INESTIMABLE; AND WHO COULD BE RICH ENOUGH IN GRATITUDE NOT TO BE IMPOVERISHED IN VIEW OF ALL THAT THE ‚ÄÚSPIRITUAL MEN‚ÄÙ OF CHRISTIANITY, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE SO FAR DONE FOR EUROPE! AND YET, WHEN THEY GAVE COMFORT TO SUFFERERS, COURAGE TO THE OPPRESSED AND DESPAIRING, A STAFF AND SUPPORT TO THE DEPENDENT, AND LURED AWAY FROM SOCIETY INTO MONASTERIES AND PENITENTIARIES FOR THE SOUL THOSE WHO HAD BEEN DESTROYED INWARDLY AND WHO HAD BECOME SAVAGE: HOW MUCH MORE DID THEY HAVE TO DO BESIDES, IN ORDER TO WORK WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE AND ON PRINCIPLE, TO PRESERVE ALL THAT WAS SICK AND THAT SUFFERED‚ÄÎWHICH MEANS, IN FACT AND IN TRUTH, TO WORSEN THE EUROPEAN RACE? STAND ALL VALUATIONS ON THEIR HEAD‚ÄÎTHAT IS WHAT THEY HAD TO DO. AND BREAK THE STRONG, SICKLY O‚ÄÔER22 GREAT HOPES, CAST SUSPICION ON THE JOY IN BEAUTY, BEND EVERYTHING HAUGHTY, MANLY, CONQUERING, DOMINEERING, ALL THE INSTINCTS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE HIGHEST AND BEST-TURNED-OUT TYPE OF ‚ÄÚMAN,‚ÄÙ INTO UNSURENESS, AGONY OF CONSCIENCE, SELF-DESTRUCTION‚ÄÎINDEED, INVERT ALL LOVE OF THE EARTHLY AND OF DOMINION OVER THE EARTH INTO HATRED OF THE EARTH AND THE EARTHLY‚ÄÎTHAT IS THE TASK THE CHURCH POSED FOR ITSELF AND HAD TO POSE, UNTIL IN ITS ESTIMATION ‚ÄÚBECOMING UNWORLDLY,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚUNSENSUAL,‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚHIGHER MEN‚ÄÙ WERE FUSED INTO A SINGLE FEELING.

SUPPOSE WE COULD CONTEMPLATE THE ODDLY PAINFUL AND EQUALLY CRUDE AND SUBTLE COMEDY OF EUROPEAN CHRISTIANITY WITH THE MOCKING AND ALOOF EYES OF AN EPICUREAN GOD, I THINK OUR AMAZEMENT AND LAUGHTER WOULD NEVER END: DOESN‚ÄÔT IT SEEM THAT A SINGLE WILL DOMINATED EUROPE FOR EIGHTEEN CENTURIES‚ÄÎTO TURN MAN INTO A SUBLIME MISCARRIAGE? ANYONE, HOWEVER, WHO APPROACHED THIS ALMOST DELIBERATE DEGENERATION AND ATROPHY OF MAN REPRESENTED BY THE CHRISTIAN EUROPEAN (PASCAL, FOR EXAMPLE), FEELING THE OPPOSITE KIND OF DESIRE, NOT IN AN EPICUREAN SPIRIT BUT RATHER WITH SOME DIVINE HAMMER IN HIS HAND, WOULD SURELY HAVE TO CRY OUT IN WRATH, IN PITY, IN HORROR: ‚ÄÚO YOU DOLTS, YOU PRESUMPTUOUS, PITYING DOLTS, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE! WAS THAT WORK FOR YOUR HANDS? HOW HAVE YOU BUNGLED AND BOTCHED MY BEAUTIFUL STONE! WHAT PRESUMPTION!‚ÄÙ

I MEANT TO SAY: CHRISTIANITY HAS BEEN THE MOST CALAMITOUS KIND OF ARROGANCE YET. MEN, NOT HIGH AND HARD ENOUGH TO HAVE ANY RIGHT TO TRY TO FORM MAN AS ARTISTS; MEN, NOT STRONG AND FAR-SIGHTED ENOUGH TO LET THE FOREGROUND LAW OF THOUSANDFOLD FAILURE AND RUIN PREVAIL, THOUGH IT COST THEM SUBLIME SELF-CONQUEST; MEN, NOT NOBLE ENOUGH TO SEE THE ABYSMALLY DIFFERENT ORDER OF RANK, CHASM OF RANK, BETWEEN MAN AND MAN‚ÄÎSUCH MEN HAVE SO FAR HELD SWAY OVER THE FATE OF EUROPE, WITH THEIR ‚ÄÚEQUAL BEFORE GOD,‚ÄÙ UNTIL FINALLY A SMALLER, ALMOST RIDICULOUS TYPE, A HERD ANIMAL, SOMETHING EAGER TO PLEASE, SICKLY, AND MEDIOCRE HAS BEEN BRED, THE EUROPEAN OF TODAY‚ÄÎ


1THE GERMAN TITLE IS DAS RELIGI√∂SE WESEN. THE WORD WESEN IS NOT EASY TO TRANSLATE. IN PHILOSOPHICAL PROSE IT IS MOST OFTEN RENDERED BY ‚ÄÚESSENCE,‚ÄÙ BUT IN MANY CONTEXTS ‚ÄÚBEING‚ÄÙ IS CALLED FOR; E.G., A NATURAL BEING, A HUMAN BEING. ABOVE, EITHER ‚ÄÚTHE RELIGIOUS NATURE‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚTHE RELIGIOUS BEING‚ÄÙ MIGHT DO. BUT IN SECTION 47 NIETZSCHE SPEAKS OF ‚ÄÚTHE RELIGIOUS NEUROSIS‚ÄÎOR WHAT I CALL ‚ÄÒDAS RELIGI√∂SE WESEN‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ; AND THIS PUTS ONE IN MIND OF CONTEXTS IN WHICH WESEN MEANS CHARACTER, CONDUCT, MANNERS, AIRS, AND EVEN ADO: VIE I WESEN MEANS MUCH ADO.

8‚ÄÚSO LET US MAKE BOLD TO SAY THAT RELIGION IS A PRODUCT OF THE NORMAL MAN, THAT MAN IS CLOSEST TO THE TRUTH WHEN HE IS MOST RELIGIOUS AND MOST CERTAIN OF AN INFINITE DESTINY‚Ä¶. IT IS WHEN HE IS GOOD THAT HE WANTS VIRTUE TO CORRESPOND TO AN ETERNAL ORDER; IT IS WHEN HE CONTEMPLATES THINGS IN A DISINTERESTED MANNER THAT HE FINDS DEATH REVOLTING AND ABSURD. HOW CAN WE BUT SUPPOSE THAT IT IS IN MOMENTS LIKE THIS THAT MAN SEES BEST?‚ÄÙ

9IN OTHER WORDS, THAT AFFIRMS LIFE AS A GREAT BOON, IN SPITE OF ALL ITS TERRORS: THIS SHOWS GREAT STRENGTH AND A REMARKABLE AND NOBLE FREEDOM FROM RESENTMENT.

12MADAME GUYON (JEANNE-MARIE BOUVIER DE LA MOTTE-GUYON, 1648-1717), WAS A FRENCH MYSTIC WHO IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE CHIEF ADVOCATES OF QUIETISM, INTRODUCED BEFORE 1675 BY MIGUEL MOLINOS (1640‚ÄÌ96), A SPANISH PRIEST WHO WAS ARRESTED BY THE ROMAN INQUISITION IN 1685 AND SENTENCED TO PERPETUAL IMPRISONMENT IN 1687. MADAME GUYON WAS IMPRISONED FROM 1695 TO 1703. THE QUIETIST DOCTRINE WAS CONDEMNED BY INNOCENT XII IN 1699. (THESE DATES ARE TAKEN FROM THE OXFORD COMPANION TO FRENCH LITERATURE, OXFORD, CLARENDON PRESS, 1959.)

‚ÄÚKNOWLEDGE FOR ITS OWN SAKE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT IS THE LAST SNARE OF MORALITY: WITH THAT ONE BECOMES COMPLETELY ENTANGLED IN IT ONCE MORE.





65


THE ATTRACTION OF KNOWLEDGE WOULD BE SMALL IF ONE DID NOT HAVE TO OVERCOME SO MUCH SHAME ON THE WAY.

ONE IS MOST DISHONEST TO ONE‚ÄÔS GOD: HE IS NOT ALLOWED TO SIN.





66


THE INCLINATION TO DEPRECIATE HIMSELF, TO LET HIMSELF BE ROBBED, LIED TO, AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF, COULD BE THE MODESTY2 OF A GOD AMONG MEN.





67


LOVE OF ONE IS A BARBARISM; FOR IT IS EXERCISED AT THE EXPENSE OF ALL OTHERS. THE LOVE OF GOD, TOO.

‚ÄÚI HAVE DONE THAT,‚ÄÙ SAYS MY MEMORY. ‚ÄÚI CANNOT HAVE DONE THAT,‚ÄÙ SAYS MY PRIDE, AND REMAINS INEXORABLE. EVENTUALLY‚ÄÎMEMORY YIELDS.3

ONE HAS WATCHED LIFE BADLY IF ONE HAS NOT ALSO SEEN THE HAND THAT CONSIDERATELY‚ÄÎKILLS.

77


WITH ONE‚ÄÔS PRINCIPLES ONE WANTS TO BULLY ONE‚ÄÔS HABITS, OR JUSTIFY, HONOR, SCOLD, OR CONCEAL THEM: TWO MEN WITH THE SAME PRINCIPLES PROBABLY AIM WITH THEM AT SOMETHING BASICALLY DIFFERENT.





78


WHOEVER DESPISES HIMSELF STILL RESPECTS HIMSELF AS ONE WHO DESPISES.





79


A SOUL THAT KNOWS IT IS LOVED BUT DOES NOT ITSELF LOVE BETRAYS ITS SEDIMENT: WHAT IS AT THE BOTTOM COMES UP.

A MATTER THAT BECOMES CLEAR CEASES TO CONCERN US.‚ÄÎWHAT WAS ON THE MIND OF THAT GOD WHO COUNSELED: ‚ÄÚKNOW THYSELF!‚ÄÙ DID HE MEAN: ‚ÄÚCEASE TO CONCERN YOURSELF! BECOME OBJECTIVE!‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎ AND SOCRATES?‚ÄÎ AND ‚ÄÚSCIENTIFIC MEN‚ÄÙ?‚ÄÎ

IT IS TERRIBLE TO DIE OF THIRST IN THE OCEAN. DO YOU HAVE TO SALT YOUR TRUTH SO HEAVILY THAT IT DOES NOT EVEN‚ÄÎQUENCH THIRST ANY MORE?

INSTINCT.‚ÄÎWHEN THE HOUSE BURNS ONE FORGETS EVEN LUNCH.‚ÄÎYES, BUT ONE EATS IT LATER IN THE ASHES.

WOMAN LEARNS TO HATE TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH HER CHARMS‚ÄÎDECREASE.





85


THE SAME AFFECTS IN MAN AND WOMAN ARE YET DIFFERENT IN TEMPO: THEREFORE MAN AND WOMAN DO NOT CEASE TO MISUNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.





86


WOMEN THEMSELVES ALWAYS STILL HAVE IN THE BACKGROUND OF ALL PERSONAL VANITY AN IMPERSONAL CONTEMPT‚ÄÎFOR ‚ÄÚWOMAN.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎ

TETHERED HEART, FREE SPIRIT.‚ÄÎIF ONE TETHERS ONE‚ÄÔS HEART SEVERELY ARID IMPRISONS IT, ONE CAN GIVE ONE‚ÄÔS SPIRIT MANY LIBERTIES: I HAVE SAID THAT ONCE BEFORE. BUT ONE DOES NOT BELIEVE ME, UNLESS ONE ALREADY KNOWS IT‚ÄÎ





88


ONE BEGINS TO MISTRUST VERY CLEVER PEOPLE WHEN THEY BECOME EMBARRASSED.





89


TERRIBLE EXPERIENCES POSE THE RIDDLE WHETHER THE PERSON WHO HAS THEM IS NOT TERRIBLE.





90


HEAVY, HEAVY-SPIRITED PEOPLE BECOME LIGHTER PRECISELY THROUGH WHAT MAKES OTHERS HEAVIER, THROUGH HATRED AND LOVE, AND FOR A TIME THEY SURFACE.





91


SO COLD, SO ICY THAT ONE BURNS ONE‚ÄÔS FINGERS ON HIM! EVERY HAND IS STARTLED WHEN TOUCHING HIM.‚ÄÎ AND FOR THAT VERY REASON SOME THINK HE GLOWS.





92


WHO HAS NOT, FOR THE SAKE OF HIS GOOD REPUTATION‚ÄÎSACRIFICED HIMSELF ONCE?‚ÄÎ





93


AFFABILITY CONTAINS NO HATRED OF MEN, BUT FOR THAT VERY REASON TOO MUCH CONTEMPT FOR MEN.





94


A MAN‚ÄÔS MATURITY‚ÄÎCONSISTS IN HAVING FOUND AGAIN THE SERIOUSNESS ONE HAD AS A CHILD, AT PLAY.





95


TO BE ASHAMED OF ONE‚ÄÔS IMMORALITY‚ÄÎTHAT IS A STEP ON THE STAIRCASE AT WHOSE END ONE IS ALSO ASHAMED OF ONE‚ÄÔS MORALITY.





96


ONE SHOULD PART FROM LIFE AS ODYSSEUS PARTED FROM NAUSICAA‚ÄÎBLESSING IT RATHER THAN IN LOVE WITH IT.





97


WHAT? A GREAT MAN? I ALWAYS SEE ONLY THE ACTOR OF HIS OWN IDEAL.

IN FRONT OF OURSELVES WE ALL POSE AS SIMPLER THAN WE ARE: THUS WE TAKE A REST FROM OUR FELLOW MEN.





101


TODAY THE MAN OF KNOWLEDGE MIGHT WELL FEEL LIKE GOD BECOME ANIMAL.





102


DISCOVERING THAT ONE IS LOVED IN RETURN REALLY OUGHT TO DISENCHANT THE LOVER WITH THE BELOVED. ‚ÄÚWHAT? THIS PERSON IS MODEST ENOUGH TO LOVE EVEN YOU? OR STUPID ENOUGH? OR‚ÄÎOR‚ÄÎ‚ÄÙ





103


DANGER IN HAPPINESS.7‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚNOW EVERYTHING REDOUNDS TO MY BEST, NOW I LOVE EVERY DESTINY‚ÄÎWHO FEELS LIKE BEING MY DESTINY?‚ÄÙ





104


NOT THEIR LOVE OF MEN BUT THE IMPOTENCE OF THEIR LOVE OF MEN KEEPS THE CHRISTIANS OF TODAY FROM‚ÄÎBURNING US.8





105


THE PIA FRAUS9 OFFENDS THE TASTE (THE ‚ÄÚPIETY‚ÄÙ) OF THE FREE SPIRIT, WHO HAS ‚ÄÚTHE PIETY OF THE SEARCH FOR KNOWLEDGE,‚ÄÙ EVEN MORE THAN THE IMPIA FRAUS. HENCE HIS PROFOUND LACK OF UNDERSTANDING FOR THE CHURCH, A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE TYPE ‚ÄÚFREE SPIRIT‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHIS UN-FREEDOM.





106


IN MUSIC THE PASSIONS ENJOY THEMSELVES.





107


ONCE THE DECISION HAS BEEN MADE, CLOSE YOUR EAR EVEN TO THE BEST COUNTERARGUMENT: SIGN OF A STRONG CHARACTER. THUS AN OCCASIONAL WILL TO STUPIDITY.





108


THERE ARE NO MORAL PHENOMENA AT ALL, BUT ONLY A MORAL INTERPRETATION OF PHENOMENA‚ÄÎ





109


A CRIMINAL IS FREQUENTLY NOT EQUAL TO HIS DEED: HE MAKES IT SMALLER AND SLANDERS IT.10





110


THE LAWYERS DEFENDING A CRIMINAL ARE RARELY ARTISTS ENOUGH TO TURN THE BEAUTIFUL TERRIBLENESS OF HIS DEED TO HIS ADVANTAGE.





111


OUR VANITY IS HARDEST TO WOUND WHEN OUR PRIDE HAS JUST BEEN WOUNDED.





112


THOSE WHO FEEL PREDESTINED TO SEE AND NOT TO BELIEVE WILL FIND ALL BELIEVERS TOO NOISY AND OBTRUSIVE: THEY FEND THEM OFF.





113


‚ÄÚYOU WANT TO PREPOSSESS HIM IN YOUR FAVOR? THEN PRETEND TO BE EMBARRASSED IN HIS PRESENCE‚ÄÎ‚ÄÙ





114


THE ENORMOUS EXPECTATION IN SEXUAL LOVE AND THE SENSE OF SHAME IN THIS EXPECTATION SPOILS ALL PERSPECTIVE FOR WOMEN FROM THE START.





115


WHERE NEITHER LOVE NOR HATRED IS IN THE GAME, A WOMAN‚ÄÔS GAME IS MEDIOCRE.





116


THE GREAT EPOCHS OF OUR LIFE COME WHEN WE GAIN THE COURAGE TO RECHRISTEN OUR EVIL AS WHAT IS BEST IN US,





117


THE WILL TO OVERCOME AN AFFECT IS ULTIMATELY ONLY THE WILL OF ANOTHER, OR OF SEVERAL OTHER, AFFECTS.





118


THERE IS AN INNOCENCE IN ADMIRATION; IT IS FOUND IN THOSE TO WHOM IT HAS NEVER YET OCCURRED THAT THEY, TOO, MIGHT BE ADMIRED SOME DAY.





119


THE DISGUST WITH DIRT CAN BE SO GREAT THAT IT KEEPS US FROM CLEANING OURSELVES‚ÄÎFROM ‚ÄÚJUSTIFYING‚ÄÙ OURSELVES.





120


SENSUALITY OFTEN HASTENS THE GROWTH OF LOVE SO MUCH THAT THE ROOTS REMAIN WEAK AND ARE EASILY TORN UP.





121


IT WAS SUBTLE OF GOD TO LEARN GREEK WHEN HE WISHED TO BECOME AN AUTHOR‚ÄÎAND NOT TO LEARN IT BETTER.





122


ENJOYING PRAISE IS IN SOME PEOPLE MERELY A COURTESY OF THE HEART‚ÄÎAND JUST THE OPPOSITE OF VANITY OF THE SPIRIT.





123


EVEN CONCUBINAGE HAS BEEN CORRUPTED‚ÄÎBY MARRIAGE.





124


WHOEVER REJOICES ON THE VERY STAKE TRIUMPHS NOT OVER PAIN BUT AT THE ABSENCE OF PAIN THAT HE HAD EXPECTED. A PARABLE.





125


WHEN WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR MIND ABOUT A PERSON, WE HOLD THE INCONVENIENCE HE CAUSES US VERY MUCH AGAINST HIM.





126


A PEOPLE11 IS A DETOUR OF NATURE TO GET TO SIX OR SEVEN GREAT MEN.‚ÄÎYES, AND THEN TO GET AROUND THEM.





127


SCIENCE OFFENDS THE MODESTY OF ALL REAL WOMEN. IT MAKES THEM FEEL AS IF ONE WANTED TO PEEP UNDER THEIR SKIN‚ÄÎYET WORSE, UNDER THEIR DRESS AND FINERY.





128


THE MORE ABSTRACT THE TRUTH IS THAT YOU WOULD TEACH, THE MORE YOU HAVE TO SEDUCE THE SENSES TO IT.





129


THE DEVIL HAS THE BROADEST PERSPECTIVES FOR GOD; THEREFORE HE KEEPS SO FAR AWAY FROM GOD‚ÄÎTHE DEVIL BEING THE MOST ANCIENT FRIEND OF WISDOM.





130


WHAT A MAN IS BEGINS TO BETRAY ITSELF WHEN HIS TALENT DECREASES‚ÄÎWHEN HE STOPS SHOWING WHAT HE CAN DO. TALENT, TOO, IS FINERY; FINERY, TOO, IS A HIDING PLACE.





131


THE SEXES DECEIVE THEMSELVES ABOUT EACH OTHER‚ÄÎBECAUSE AT BOTTOM THEY HONOR AND LOVE ONLY THEMSELVES (OR THEIR OWN IDEAL, TO PUT IT MORE PLEASANTLY). THUS MAN LIKES WOMAN PEACEFUL‚ÄÎBUT WOMAN IS ESSENTIALLY UNPEACEFUL, LIKE A CAT, HOWEVER WELL SHE MAY HAVE TRAINED HERSELF TO SEEM PEACEABLE.





132


ONE IS BEST PUNISHED FOR ONE‚ÄÔS VIRTUES.





133


WHOEVER DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO FIND THE WAY TO HIS IDEAL LIVES MORE FRIVOLOUSLY AND IMPUDENTLY THAN THE MAN WITHOUT AN IDEAL.





134


ALL CREDIBILITY, ALL GOOD CONSCIENCE, ALL EVIDENCE OF TRUTH COME ONLY FROM THE SENSES.





135


PHARISAISM IS NOT A DEGENERATION IN A GOOD MAN: A GOOD DEAL OF IT IS RATHER THE CONDITION OF ALL BEING GOOD.





136


ONE SEEKS A MIDWIFE FOR HIS THOUGHTS, ANOTHER SOMEONE WHOM HE CAN HELP: ORIGIN OF A GOOD CONVERSATION.





137


WHEN ASSOCIATING WITH SCHOLARS AND ARTISTS WE EASILY MISCALCULATE IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS: BEHIND A REMARKABLE SCHOLAR ONE FINDS, NOT INFREQUENTLY, A MEDIOCRE MAN, AND BEHIND A MEDIOCRE ARTIST QUITE OFTEN‚ÄÎA VERY REMARKABLE MAN.





138


WHEN WE ARE AWAKE WE ALSO DO WHAT WE DO IN OUR DREAMS: WE INVENT AND MAKE UP THE PERSON WITH WHOM WE ASSOCIATE‚ÄÎAND IMMEDIATELY FORGET IT.





139


IN REVENGE AND IN LOVE WOMAN IS MORE BARBAROUS THAN MAN.

143


OUR VANITY DESIRES THAT WHAT WE DO BEST SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHAT IS HARDEST FOR US. CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF MANY A MORALITY.





144


WHEN A WOMAN HAS SCHOLARLY INCLINATIONS THERE IS USUALLY SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER SEXUALLY. STERILITY ITSELF DISPOSES ONE TOWARD A CERTAIN MASCULINITY OF TASTE; FOR MAN IS, IF I MAY SAY SO, ‚ÄÚTHE STERILE ANIMAL.‚ÄÙ





145


COMPARING MAN AND WOMAN ON THE WHOLE, ONE MAY SAY: WOMAN WOULD NOT HAVE THE GENIUS FOR FINERY IF SHE DID NOT HAVE AN INSTINCT FOR A SECONDARY ROLE.





146


WHOEVER FIGHTS MONSTERS SHOULD SEE TO IT THAT IN THE PROCESS HE DOES NOT BECOME A MONSTER. AND WHEN YOU LOOK LONG INTO AN ABYSS, THE ABYSS ALSO LOOKS INTO YOU.

WHAT A TIME EXPERIENCES AS EVIL IS USUALLY AN UNTIMELY ECHO OF WHAT WAS FORMERLY EXPERIENCED AS GOOD‚ÄÎTHE ATAVISM OF A MORE ANCIENT IDEAL.

AROUND THE HERO EVERYTHING TURNS INTO A TRAGEDY; AROUND THE DEMIGOD, INTO A SATYR PLAY; AND AROUND GOD‚ÄÎWHAT? PERHAPS INTO ‚ÄÚWORLD‚ÄÙ?‚ÄÎ

WHATEVER IS DONE FROM LOVE ALWAYS OCCURS BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL.





154

IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH EDITIONS OF 1893 AND 1894, THE EDITOR INTRODUCED MINOR CHANGES AND RENUMBERED ALL THE SECTIONS FROM THIS POINT ON. IN THE STANDARD EDITIONS (THE SO-CALLED GROSSOKTAV AND THE MUSARION EDITIONS) THIS SECTION IS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE ONE PRECEDING IT BY THE ADDITION OF AN ‚ÄÚA.‚ÄÙ SCHLECHTA, WHOSE EDITION OF THE WORKS IN THREE VOLUMES IS WIDELY CONSIDERED IMPECCABLE PHILOLOGICALLY, FOLLOWS THE STANDARD EDITIONS ALTHOUGH HE PURPORTS TO FOLLOW THE EDITION OF 1886.

THE MORAL SENTIMENT IN EUROPE TODAY IS AS REFINED, OLD, DIVERSE, IRRITABLE, AND SUBTLE, AS THE ‚ÄÚSCIENCE OF MORALS‚ÄÙ THAT ACCOMPANIES IT IS STILL YOUNG, RAW, CLUMSY, AND BUTTERFINGERED‚ÄÎAN ATTRACTIVE CONTRAST THAT OCCASIONALLY EVEN BECOMES VISIBLE AND INCARNATE IN THE PERSON OF A MORALIST. EVEN THE TERM ‚ÄÚSCIENCE OF MORALS‚ÄÙ IS MUCH TOO ARROGANT CONSIDERING WHAT IT DESIGNATES, AND OFFENDS GOOD TASTE‚ÄÎWHICH ALWAYS PREFERS MORE MODEST TERMS.

ONE SHOULD OWN UP IN ALL STRICTNESS TO WHAT IS STILL NECESSARY HERE FOR A LONG TIME TO COME, TO WHAT ALONE IS JUSTIFIED SO FAR: TO COLLECT MATERIAL, TO CONCEPTUALIZE AND ARRANGE A VAST REALM OF SUBTLE FEELINGS OF VALUE AND DIFFERENCES OF VALUE WHICH ARE ALIVE, GROW, BEGET, AND PERISH‚ÄÎAND PERHAPS ATTEMPTS TO PRESENT VIVIDLY SOME OF THE MORE FREQUENT AND RECURRING FORMS OF SUCH LIVING CRYSTALLIZATIONS‚ÄÎALL TO PREPARE A TYPOLOGY OF MORALS.

TO BE SURE, SO FAR ONE HAS NOT BEEN SO MODEST. WITH A STIFF SERIOUSNESS THAT INSPIRES LAUGHTER, ALL OUR PHILOSOPHERS DEMANDED SOMETHING FAR MORE EXALTED, PRESUMPTUOUS, AND SOLEMN FROM THEMSELVES AS SOON AS THEY APPROACHED THE STUDY OF MORALITY: THEY WANTED TO SUPPLY A RATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR MORALITY‚ÄÎAND EVERY PHILOSOPHER SO FAR HAS BELIEVED THAT HE HAS PROVIDED SUCH A FOUNDATION. MORALITY ITSELF, HOWEVER, WAS ACCEPTED AS ‚ÄÚGIVEN.‚ÄÙ HOW REMOTE FROM THEIR CLUMSY PRIDE WAS THAT TASK WHICH THEY CONSIDERED INSIGNIFICANT AND LEFT IN DUST AND MUST‚ÄÎTHE TASK OF DESCRIPTION‚ÄÎALTHOUGH THE SUBTLEST FINGERS AND SENSES CAN SCARCELY BE SUBTLE ENOUGH FOR IT.

JUST BECAUSE OUR MORAL PHILOSOPHERS KNEW THE FACTS OF MORALITY ONLY VERY APPROXIMATELY IN ARBITRARY EXTRACTS OR IN ACCIDENTAL EPITOMES‚ÄÎFOR EXAMPLE, AS THE MORALITY OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT, THEIR CLASS, THEIR CHURCH, THE SPIRIT OF THEIR TIME, THEIR CLIMATE AND PART OF THE WORLD‚ÄÎJUST BECAUSE THEY WERE POORLY INFORMED AND NOT EVEN VERY CURIOUS ABOUT DIFFERENT PEOPLES, TIMES, AND PAST AGES‚ÄÎTHEY NEVER LAID EYES ON THE REAL PROBLEMS OF MORALITY; FOR THESE EMERGE ONLY WHEN WE COMPARE MANY MORALITIES. IN ALL ‚ÄÚSCIENCE OF MORALS‚ÄÙ SO FAR ONE THING WAS LACKING, STRANGE AS IT MAY SOUND: THE PROBLEM OF MORALITY ITSELF; WHAT WAS LACKING WAS ANY SUSPICION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING PROBLEMATIC HERE. WHAT THE PHILOSOPHERS CALLED ‚ÄÚA RATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR MORALITY‚ÄÙ AND TRIED TO SUPPLY WAS, SEEN IN THE RIGHT LIGHT, MERELY A SCHOLARLY VARIATION OF THE COMMON FAITH IN THE PREVALENT MORALITY; A NEW MEANS OF EXPRESSION FOR THIS FAITH; AND THUS JUST ANOTHER FACT WITHIN A PARTICULAR MORALITY; INDEED, IN THE LAST ANALYSIS A KIND OF DENIAL THAT THIS MORALITY MIGHT EVER BE CONSIDERED PROBLEMATIC‚ÄÎCERTAINLY THE VERY OPPOSITE OF AN EXAMINATION, ANALYSIS, QUESTIONING, AND VIVISECTION OF THIS VERY FAITH.

LISTEN, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH WHAT ALMOST VENERABLE INNOCENCE SCHOPENHAUER STILL DESCRIBED HIS TASK, AND THEN DRAW YOUR CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE SCIENTIFIC STANDING OF A ‚ÄÚSCIENCE‚ÄÙ WHOSE ULTIMATE MASTERS STILL TALK LIKE CHILDREN AND LITTLE OLD WOMEN: ‚ÄÚTHE PRINCIPLE,‚ÄÙ HE SAYS (P. 136 OF GRUNDPROBLEME DER MORAL),1 ‚ÄÚTHE FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITION ON WHOSE CONTENTS ALL MORAL PHILOSOPHERS ARE REALLY2 AGREED‚ÄÎNEMINEM LAEDE, IMMO OMNES, QUANTUM POTES, JUVA3‚ÄÎTHAT IS REALLY THE PROPOSITION FOR WHICH ALL MORALISTS ENDEAVOR TO FIND THE RATIONAL FOUNDATION ‚Ä¶ THE REAL BASIS OF ETHICS FOR WHICH ONE HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS AS FOR THE PHILOSOPHER‚ÄÔS STONE.‚ÄÙ

THE DIFFICULTY OF PROVIDING A RATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR THE PRINCIPLE CITED MAY INDEED BE GREAT‚ÄÎAS IS WELL KNOWN, SCHOPENHAUER DID NOT SUCCEED EITHER‚ÄÎAND WHOEVER HAS ONCE FELT DEEPLY HOW INSIPIDLY FALSE AND SENTIMENTAL THIS PRINCIPLE IS IN A WORLD WHOSE ESSENCE IS WILL TO POWER, MAY ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE REMINDED THAT SCHOPENHAUER, THOUGH A PESSIMIST, REALLY‚ÄÎPLAYED THE FLUTE. EVERY DAY, AFTER DINNER: ONE SHOULD READ HIS BIOGRAPHY ON THAT. AND INCIDENTALLY: A PESSIMIST, ONE WHO DENIES GOD AND THE WORLD BUT COMES TO A STOP BEFORE MORALITY‚ÄÎWHO AFFIRMS MORALITY AND PLAYS THE FLUTE‚ÄÎTHE LAEDE NEMINEM MORALITY‚ÄÎWHAT? IS THAT REALLY‚ÄÎA PESSIMIST?





187


EVEN APART FROM THE VALUE OF SUCH CLAIMS AS ‚ÄÚTHERE IS A CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE IN US,‚ÄÙ ONE CAN STILL ALWAYS ASK: WHAT DOES SUCH A CLAIM TELL US ABOUT THE MAN WHO MAKES IT? THERE ARE MORALITIES WHICH ARE MEANT TO JUSTIFY THEIR CREATOR BEFORE OTHERS. OTHER MORALITIES ARE MEANT TO CALM HIM AND LEAD HIM TO BE SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF. WITH YET OTHERS HE WANTS TO CRUCIFY HIMSELF AND HUMILIATE HIMSELF. WITH OTHERS HE WANTS TO WREAK REVENGE, WITH OTHERS CONCEAL HIMSELF, WITH OTHERS TRANSFIGURE HIMSELF AND PLACE HIMSELF WAY UP, AT A DISTANCE. THIS MORALITY IS USED BY ITS CREATOR TO FORGET, THAT ONE TO HAVE OTHERS FORGET HIM OR SOMETHING ABOUT HIM. SOME MORALISTS WANT TO VENT THEIR POWER AND CREATIVE WHIMS ON HUMANITY; SOME OTHERS, PERHAPS INCLUDING KANT, SUGGEST WITH THEIR MORALITY: ‚ÄÚWHAT DESERVES RESPECT IN ME IS THAT I CAN OBEY‚ÄÎAND YOU OUGHT NOT TO BE DIFFERENT FROM ME.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎIN SHORT, MORALITIES ARE ALSO MERELY A SIGN LANGUAGE OF THE AFFECTS.





188


EVERY MORALITY IS, AS OPPOSED TO LAISSER ALLER4 A BIT OF TYRANNY AGAINST ‚ÄÚNATURE;‚ÄÙ ALSO AGAINST ‚ÄÚREASON;‚ÄÙ BUT THIS IN ITSELF IS NO OBJECTION, AS LONG AS WE DO NOT HAVE SOME OTHER MORALITY WHICH PERMITS US TO DECREE THAT EVERY KIND OF TYRANNY AND UNREASON IS IMPERMISSIBLE. WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND INESTIMABLE IN EVERY MORALITY IS THAT IT CONSTITUTES A LONG COMPULSION: TO UNDERSTAND STOICISM OR PORT-ROYAL OR PURITANISM, ONE SHOULD RECALL THE COMPULSION UNDER WHICH EVERY LANGUAGE SO FAR HAS ACHIEVED STRENGTH AND FREEDOM‚ÄÎTHE METRICAL COMPULSION OF RHYME AND RHYTHM.

HOW MUCH TROUBLE THE POETS AND ORATORS OF ALL PEOPLES HAVE TAKEN‚ÄÎNOT EXCEPTING A FEW PROSE WRITERS TODAY IN WHOSE EAR THERE DWELLS AN INEXORABLE CONSCIENCE‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚFOR THE SAKE OF SOME FOOLISHNESS,‚ÄÙ AS UTILITARIAN DOLTS SAY, FEELING SMART‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚSUBMITTING ABJECTLY TO CAPRICIOUS LAWS,‚ÄÙ AS ANARCHISTS SAY, FEELING ‚ÄÚFREE,‚ÄÙ EVEN ‚ÄÚFREE-SPIRITED.‚ÄÙ BUT THE CURIOUS FACT IS THAT ALL THERE IS OR HAS BEEN ON EARTH OF FREEDOM, SUBTLETY, BOLDNESS, DANCE, AND MASTERLY SURENESS, WHETHER IN THOUGHT ITSELF OR IN GOVERNMENT, OR IN RHETORIC AND PERSUASION, IN THE ARTS JUST AS IN ETHICS, HAS DEVELOPED ONLY OWING TO THE ‚ÄÚTYRANNY OF SUCH CAPRICIOUS LAWS;‚ÄÙ AND IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, THE PROBABILITY IS BY NO MEANS SMALL THAT PRECISELY THIS IS ‚ÄÚNATURE‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚNATURAL‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND NOT THAT LAISSER ALLER.

EVERY ARTIST KNOWS HOW FAR FROM ANY FEELING OF LETTING HIMSELF GO HIS ‚ÄÚMOST NATURAL‚ÄÙ STATE IS‚ÄÎTHE FREE ORDERING, PLACING, DISPOSING, GIVING FORM IN THE MOMENT OF ‚ÄÚINSPIRATION‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND HOW STRICTLY AND SUBTLY HE OBEYS THOUSANDFOLD LAWS PRECISELY THEN, LAWS THAT PRECISELY ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR HARDNESS AND DETERMINATION DEFY ALL FORMULATION THROUGH CONCEPTS (EVEN THE FIRMEST CONCEPT IS, COMPARED WITH THEM, NOT FREE OF FLUCTUATION, MULTIPLICITY, AND AMBIGUITY).

WHAT IS ESSENTIAL ‚ÄÚIN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH‚ÄÙ SEEMS TO BE, TO SAY IT ONCE MORE, THAT THERE SHOULD BE OBEDIENCE OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND IN A SINGLE DIRECTION: GIVEN THAT, SOMETHING ALWAYS DEVELOPS, AND HAS DEVELOPED, FOR WHOSE SAKE IT IS WORTH WHILE TO LIVE ON EARTH; FOR EXAMPLE, VIRTUE, ART, MUSIC, DANCE, REASON, SPIRITUALITY‚ÄÎSOMETHING TRANSFIGURING, SUBTLE, MAD, AND DIVINE. THE LONG UNFREEDOM OF THE SPIRIT, THE MISTRUSTFUL CONSTRAINT IN THE COMMUNICABILITY OF THOUGHTS, THE DISCIPLINE THINKERS IMPOSED ON THEMSELVES TO THINK WITHIN THE DIRECTIONS LAID DOWN BY A CHURCH OR COURT, OR UNDER ARISTOTELIAN PRESUPPOSITIONS, THE LONG SPIRITUAL WILL TO INTERPRET ALL EVENTS UNDER A CHRISTIAN SCHEMA AND TO REDISCOVER AND JUSTIFY THE CHRISTIAN GOD IN EVERY ACCIDENT‚ÄÎALL THIS, HOWEVER FORCED, CAPRICIOUS, HARD, GRUESOME, AND ANTI-RATIONAL, HAS SHOWN ITSELF TO BE THE MEANS THROUGH WHICH THE EUROPEAN SPIRIT HAS BEEN TRAINED TO STRENGTH, RUTHLESS CURIOSITY, AND SUBTLE MOBILITY, THOUGH ADMITTEDLY IN THE PROCESS AN IRREPLACEABLE AMOUNT OF STRENGTH AND SPIRIT HAD TO BE CRUSHED, STIFLED, AND RUINED (FOR HERE, AS EVERYWHERE, ‚ÄÚNATURE‚ÄÙ MANIFESTS HERSELF AS SHE IS, IN ALL HER PRODIGAL AND INDIFFERENT MAGNIFICENCE WHICH IS OUTRAGEOUS BUT NOBLE).

THAT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS EUROPEAN THINKERS THOUGHT MERELY IN ORDER TO PROVE SOMETHING‚ÄÎTODAY, CONVERSELY, WE SUSPECT EVERY THINKER WHO ‚ÄÚWANTS TO PROVE SOMETHING‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT THE CONCLUSIONS THAT OUGHT TO BE THE RESULT OF THEIR MOST RIGOROUS REFLECTION WERE ALWAYS SETTLED FROM THE START, JUST AS IT USED TO BE WITH ASIATIC ASTROLOGY, AND STILL IS TODAY WITH THE INNOCUOUS CHRISTIAN-MORAL INTERPRETATION OF OUR MOST INTIMATE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES ‚ÄÚFOR THE GLORY OF GOD‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚFOR THE SALVATION OF THE SOUL‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHIS TYRANNY, THIS CAPRICE, THIS RIGOROUS AND GRANDIOSE STUPIDITY HAS EDUCATED THE SPIRIT. SLAVERY IS, AS IT SEEMS, BOTH IN THE CRUDER AND IN THE MORE SUBTLE SENSE, THE INDISPENSABLE MEANS OF SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE AND CULTIVATION,5 TOO. CONSIDER ANY MORALITY WITH THIS IN MIND: WHAT THERE IS IN IT OF ‚ÄÚNATURE‚ÄÙ TEACHES HATRED OF THE LAISSER ALLER, OF ANY ALL-TOO-GREAT FREEDOM, AND IMPLANTS THE NEED FOR LIMITED HORIZONS AND THE NEAREST TASKS‚ÄÎTEACHING THE NARROWING OF OUR PERSPECTIVE, AND THUS IN A CERTAIN SENSE STUPIDITY, AS A CONDITION OF LIFE AND GROWTH.

‚ÄÚYOU SHALL OBEY‚ÄÎSOMEONE AND FOR A LONG TIME: ELSE YOU WILL PERISH AND LOSE THE LAST RESPECT FOR YOURSELF‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHIS APPEARS TO ME TO BE THE MORAL IMPERATIVE OF NATURE WHICH, TO BE SURE, IS NEITHER ‚ÄÚCATEGORICAL‚ÄÙ AS THE OLD KANT WOULD HAVE IT (HENCE THE ‚ÄÚELSE‚ÄÙ) NOR ADDRESSED TO THE INDIVIDUAL (WHAT DO INDIVIDUALS MATTER TO HER?), BUT TO PEOPLES, RACES, AGES, CLASSES‚ÄÎBUT ABOVE ALL TO THE WHOLE HUMAN ANIMAL, TO MAN.

INDUSTRIOUS RACES FIND IT VERY TROUBLESOME TO ENDURE LEISURE: IT WAS A MASTERPIECE OF ENGLISH INSTINCT TO MAKE THE SABBATH SO HOLY AND SO BORING THAT THE ENGLISH BEGIN UNCONSCIOUSLY TO LUST AGAIN FOR THEIR WORK- AND WEEK-DAY. IT IS A KIND OF CLEVERLY INVENTED, CLEVERLY INSERTED FAST, THE LIKE OF WHICH IS ALSO ENCOUNTERED FREQUENTLY IN THE ANCIENT WORLD (ALTHOUGH, IN FAIRNESS TO SOUTHERN PEOPLES, NOT EXACTLY IN REGARD TO WORK). THERE HAVE TO BE FASTS OF MANY KINDS; AND WHEREVER POWERFUL DRIVES AND HABITS PREVAIL, LEGISLATORS HAVE TO SEE TO IT THAT INTERCALARY DAYS ARE INSERTED ON WHICH SUCH A DRIVE IS CHAINED AND LEARNS AGAIN TO HUNGER. VIEWED FROM A HIGHER VANTAGE POINT, WHOLE GENERATIONS AND AGES THAT MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE, INFECTED WITH SOME MORAL FANATICISM, SEEM TO BE SUCH TIMES OF CONSTRAINT AND FASTING DURING WHICH A DRIVE LEARNS TO STOOP AND SUBMIT, BUT ALSO TO PURIFY AND SHARPEN ITSELF. A FEW PHILOSOPHICAL SECTS, TOO, PERMIT SUCH AN INTERPRETATION (FOR EXAMPLE, THE STOA IN THE MIDST OF HELLENISTIC CULTURE WITH ITS LASCIVIOUS ATMOSPHERE, OVERCHARGED WITH APHRODISIAC ODORS).

THIS IS ALSO A HINT FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THE PARADOX: WHY IT WAS PRECISELY DURING THE MOST CHRISTIAN PERIOD OF EUROPE AND ALTOGETHER ONLY UNDER THE PRESSURE OF CHRISTIAN VALUE JUDGMENTS THAT THE SEX DRIVE SUBLIMATED6 ITSELF INTO LOVE (AMOUR-PASSION).

THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE MORALITY OF PLATO THAT DOES NOT REALLY BELONG TO PLATO BUT IS MERELY ENCOUNTERED IN HIS PHILOSOPHY‚ÄÎONE MIGHT SAY, IN SPITE OF PLATO: NAMELY, THE SOCRATISM FOR WHICH HE WAS REALLY TOO NOBLE. ‚ÄÚNOBODY WANTS TO DO HARM TO HIMSELF, THEREFORE ALL THAT IS BAD IS DONE INVOLUNTARILY. FOR THE BAD DO HARM TO THEMSELVES: THIS THEY WOULD NOT DO IF THEY KNEW THAT THE BAD IS BAD. HENCE THE BAD ARE BAD ONLY BECAUSE OF AN ERROR; IF ONE REMOVES THE ERROR, ONE NECESSARILY MAKES THEM‚ÄÎGOOD.‚ÄÙ

THIS TYPE OF INFERENCE SMELLS OF THE RABBLE THAT SEES NOTHING IN BAD ACTIONS BUT THE UNPLEASANT CONSEQUENCES AND REALLY JUDGES, ‚ÄÚIT IS STUPID TO DO WHAT IS BAD,‚ÄÙ WHILE ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ IS TAKEN WITHOUT FURTHER ADO TO BE IDENTICAL WITH ‚ÄÚUSEFUL AND AGREEABLE.‚ÄÙ IN THE CASE OF EVERY MORAL UTILITARIANISM ONE MAY IMMEDIATELY INFER THE SAME ORIGIN AND FOLLOW ONE‚ÄÔS NOSE: ONE WILL RARELY GO ASTRAY.

PLATO DID EVERYTHING HE COULD IN ORDER TO READ SOMETHING REFINED AND NOBLE INTO THE PROPOSITION OF HIS TEACHER‚ÄÎABOVE ALL, HIMSELF. HE WAS THE MOST AUDACIOUS OF ALL INTERPRETERS AND TOOK THE WHOLE SOCRATES ONLY THE WAY ONE PICKS A POPULAR TUNE AND FOLK SONG FROM THE STREETS IN ORDER TO VARY IT INTO THE INFINITE AND IMPOSSIBLE‚ÄÎNAMELY, INTO ALL OF HIS OWN MASKS AND MULTIPLICITIES. IN A JEST, HOMERIC AT THAT: WHAT IS THE PLATONIC SOCRATES AFTER ALL IF NOT PROSTHE PLAT≈ÇN OPITHEN TE PLAT≈ÇN MESSE TE CHIMAIRA.7

THE ANCIENT THEOLOGICAL PROBLEM OF ‚ÄÚFAITH‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚKNOWLEDGE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎOR, MORE CLEARLY, OF INSTINCT AND REASON‚ÄÎIN OTHER WORDS, THE QUESTION WHETHER REGARDING THE VALUATION OF THINGS INSTINCT DESERVES MORE AUTHORITY THAN RATIONALITY, WHICH WANTS US TO EVALUATE AND ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH REASONS, WITH A ‚ÄÚWHY?‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎIN OTHER WORDS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXPEDIENCE AND UTILITY‚ÄÎTHIS IS STILL THE ANCIENT MORAL PROBLEM THAT FIRST EMERGED IN THE PERSON OF SOCRATES AND DIVIDED THINKING PEOPLE LONG BEFORE CHRISTIANITY. SOCRATES HIMSELF, TO BE SURE, WITH THE TASTE OF HIS TALENT‚ÄÎTHAT OF A SUPERIOR DIALECTICIAN‚ÄÎHAD INITIALLY SIDED WITH REASON; AND IN FACT, WHAT DID HE DO HIS LIFE LONG BUT LAUGH AT THE AWKWARD INCAPACITY OF NOBLE ATHENIANS WHO, LIKE ALL NOBLE MEN, WERE MEN OF INSTINCT AND NEVER COULD GIVE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE REASONS FOR THEIR ACTIONS? IN THE END, HOWEVER, PRIVATELY AND SECRETLY, HE LAUGHED AT HIMSELF, TOO: IN HIMSELF HE FOUND, BEFORE HIS SUBTLE CONSCIENCE AND SELF-EXAMINATION, THE SAME DIFFICULTY AND INCAPACITY. BUT IS THAT ANY REASON, HE ENCOURAGED HIMSELF, FOR GIVING UP THE INSTINCTS? ONE HAS TO SEE TO IT THAT THEY AS WELL AS REASON RECEIVE THEIR DUE‚ÄÎONE MUST FOLLOW THE INSTINCTS BUT PERSUADE REASON TO ASSIST THEM WITH GOOD REASONS. THIS WAS THE REAL FALSENESS OF THAT GREAT IRONIC, SO RICH IN SECRETS; HE GOT HIS CONSCIENCE TO BE SATISFIED WITH A KIND OF SELF-TRICKERY: AT BOTTOM, HE HAD SEEN THROUGH THE IRRATIONAL ELEMENT IN MORAL JUDGMENTS.

PLATO, MORE INNOCENT IN SUCH MATTERS AND LACKING THE CRAFTINESS OF THE PLEBEIAN, WANTED TO EMPLOY ALL HIS STRENGTH‚ÄÎTHE GREATEST STRENGTH ANY PHILOSOPHER SO FAR HAS HAD AT HIS DISPOSAL‚ÄÎTO PROVE TO HIMSELF THAT REASON AND INSTINCT OF THEMSELVES TEND TOWARD ONE GOAL, THE GOOD, ‚ÄÚGOD.‚ÄÙ AND SINCE PLATO, ALL THEOLOGIANS AND PHILOSOPHERS ARE ON THE SAME TRACK‚ÄÎTHAT IS, IN MORAL MATTERS IT HAS SO FAR BEEN INSTINCT, OR WHAT THE CHRISTIANS CALL ‚ÄÚFAITH,‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚTHE HERD,‚ÄÙ AS I PUT IT, THAT HAS TRIUMPHED. PERHAPS DESCARTES SHOULD BE EXCEPTED, AS THE FATHER OF RATIONALISM (AND HENCE THE GRANDFATHER OF THE REVOLUTION) WHO CONCEDED AUTHORITY TO REASON ALONE: BUT REASON IS MERELY AN INSTRUMENT, AND DESCARTES WAS SUPERFICIAL.





192


WHOEVER HAS TRACED THE HISTORY OF AN INDIVIDUAL SCIENCE FINDS A CLUE IN ITS DEVELOPMENT FOR UNDERSTANDING THE MOST ANCIENT AND COMMON PROCESSES OF ALL ‚ÄÚKNOWLEDGE AND COGNITION.‚ÄÙ THERE AS HERE IT IS THE RASH HYPOTHESES, THE FICTIONS, THE GOOD DUMB WILL TO ‚ÄÚBELIEVE,‚ÄÙ THE LACK OF MISTRUST AND PATIENCE THAT ARE DEVELOPED FIRST; OUR SENSES LEARN ONLY LATE, AND NEVER LEARN ENTIRELY, TO BE SUBTLE, FAITHFUL, AND CAUTIOUS ORGANS OF COGNITION. OUR EYE FINDS IT MORE COMFORTABLE TO RESPOND TO A GIVEN STIMULUS BY REPRODUCING ONCE MORE AN IMAGE THAT IT HAS PRODUCED MANY TIMES BEFORE, INSTEAD OF REGISTERING WHAT IS DIFFERENT AND NEW IN AN IMPRESSION. THE LATTER WOULD REQUIRE MORE STRENGTH, MORE ‚ÄÚMORALITY.‚ÄÙ HEARING SOMETHING NEW IS EMBARRASSING AND DIFFICULT FOR THE EAR; FOREIGN MUSIC WE DO NOT HEAR WELL. WHEN WE HEAR ANOTHER LANGUAGE WE TRY INVOLUNTARILY TO FORM THE SOUNDS WE HEAR INTO WORDS THAT SOUND MORE FAMILIAR AND MORE LIKE HOME TO US: THUS THE GERMAN, FOR EXAMPLE, TRANSFORMED ARCUBALISTA, WHEN HE HEARD THAT, INTO ARMBRUST.8 WHAT IS NEW FINDS OUR SENSES, TOO, HOSTILE AND RELUCTANT; AND EVEN IN THE ‚ÄÚSIMPLEST‚ÄÙ PROCESSES OF SENSATION THE AFFECTS DOMINATE, SUCH AS FEAR, LOVE, HATRED, INCLUDING THE PASSIVE AFFECTS OF LAZINESS.

JUST AS LITTLE AS A READER TODAY READS ALL OF THE INDIVIDUAL WORDS (LET ALONE SYLLABLES) ON A PAGE‚ÄÎRATHER HE PICKS ABOUT FIVE WORDS AT RANDOM OUT OF TWENTY AND ‚ÄÚGUESSES‚ÄÙ AT THE MEANING THAT PROBABLY BELONGS TO THESE FIVE WORDS‚ÄÎJUST AS LITTLE DO WE SEE A TREE EXACTLY AND COMPLETELY WITH REFERENCE TO LEAVES, TWIGS, COLOR, AND FORM; IT IS SO VERY MUCH EASIER FOR US SIMPLY TO IMPROVISE SOME APPROXIMATION OF A TREE. EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THE STRANGEST EXPERIENCES WE STILL DO THE SAME: WE MAKE UP THE MAJOR PART OF THE EXPERIENCE AND CAN SCARCELY BE FORCED NOT TO CONTEMPLATE SOME EVENT AS ITS ‚ÄÚINVENTORS.‚ÄÙ ALL THIS MEANS: BASICALLY AND FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL WE ARE‚ÄÎACCUSTOMED TO LYING. OR TO PUT IT MORE VIRTUOUSLY AND HYPOCRITICALLY, IN SHORT, MORE PLEASANTLY: ONE IS MUCH MORE OF AN ARTIST THAN ONE KNOWS.

IN AN ANIMATED CONVERSATION I OFTEN SEE THE FACE OF THE PERSON WITH WHOM I AM TALKING SO CLEARLY AND SO SUBTLY DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE THOUGHT HE EXPRESSES, OR THAT I BELIEVE HAS BEEN PRODUCED IN HIM, THAT THIS DEGREE OF CLARITY FAR SURPASSES MY POWERS OF VISION: SO THE SUBTLE SHADES OF THE PLAY OF THE MUSCLES AND THE EXPRESSION OF THE EYES MUST HAVE BEEN MADE UP BY ME. PROBABLY THE PERSON MADE AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT FACE, OR NONE AT ALL.





193


QUIDQUID LUCE FUIT, TENEBRIS AGIT:9 BUT THE OTHER WAY AROUND, TOO. WHAT WE EXPERIENCE IN DREAMS‚ÄÎASSUMING THAT WE EXPERIENCE IT OFTEN‚ÄÎBELONGS IN THE END JUST AS MUCH TO THE OVER-ALL ECONOMY OF OUR SOUL AS ANYTHING EXPERIENCED ‚ÄÚACTUALLY‚ÄÙ: WE ARE RICHER OR POORER ON ACCOUNT OF IT, HAVE ONE NEED MORE OR LESS, AND FINALLY ARE LED A LITTLE BY THE HABITS OF OUR DREAMS EVEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AND IN THE MOST CHEERFUL MOMENTS OF OUR WIDE-AWAKE SPIRIT.

SUPPOSE SOMEONE HAS FLOWN OFTEN IN HIS DREAMS AND FINALLY, AS SOON AS HE DREAMS, HE IS CONSCIOUS OF HIS POWER AND ART OF FLIGHT AS IF IT WERE HIS PRIVILEGE, ALSO HIS CHARACTERISTIC AND ENVIABLE HAPPINESS. HE BELIEVES HIMSELF CAPABLE OF REALIZING EVERY KIND OF ARC AND ANGLE SIMPLY WITH THE LIGHTEST IMPULSE; HE KNOWS THE FEELING OF A CERTAIN DIVINE FRIVOLITY, AN ‚ÄÚUPWARD‚ÄÙ WITHOUT TENSION AND CONSTRAINT, A ‚ÄÚDOWNWARD‚ÄÙ WITHOUT CONDESCENSION AND HUMILIATION‚ÄÎWITHOUT GRAVITY! HOW COULD A HUMAN BEING WHO HAD HAD SUCH DREAM EXPERIENCES AND DREAM HABITS FAIL TO FIND THAT THE WORD ‚ÄÚHAPPINESS‚ÄÙ HAD A DIFFERENT COLOR AND DEFINITION IN HIS WAKING LIFE, TOO? HOW COULD HE FAIL TO‚ÄÎDESIRE HAPPINESS DIFFERENTLY? ‚ÄÚRISING‚ÄÙ AS DESCRIBED BY POETS MUST SEEM TO HIM, COMPARED WITH THIS ‚ÄÚFLYING,‚ÄÙ TOO EARTHBOUND, MUSCLE-BOUND, FORCED, TOO ‚ÄÚGRAVE.‚ÄÙ





194


THE DIFFERENCE AMONG MEN BECOMES MANIFEST NOT ONLY IN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR TABLETS OF GOODS‚ÄÎIN THE FACT THAT THEY CONSIDER DIFFERENT GOODS WORTH STRIVING FOR AND ALSO DISAGREE ABOUT WHAT IS MORE AND LESS VALUABLE, ABOUT THE ORDER OF RANK OF THE GOODS THEY RECOGNIZE IN COMMON‚ÄÎIT BECOMES MANIFEST EVEN MORE IN WHAT THEY TAKE FOR REALLY HAVING AND POSSESSING SOMETHING GOOD.

REGARDING A WOMAN, FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE MEN WHO ARE MORE MODEST CONSIDER THE MERE USE OF THE BODY AND SEXUAL GRATIFICATION A SUFFICIENT AND SATISFYING SIGN OF ‚ÄÚHAVING,‚ÄÙ OF POSSESSION. ANOTHER TYPE, WITH A MORE SUSPICIOUS AND DEMANDING THIRST FOR POSSESSION, SEES THE ‚ÄÚQUESTION MARK,‚ÄÙ THE ILLUSORY QUALITY OF SUCH ‚ÄÚHAVING‚ÄÙ AND WANTS SUBTLER TESTS, ABOVE ALL IN ORDER TO KNOW WHETHER THE WOMAN DOES NOT ONLY GIVE HERSELF TO HIM BUT ALSO GIVES UP FOR HIS SAKE WHAT SHE HAS OR WOULD LIKE TO HAVE: ONLY THEN DOES SHE SEEM TO HIM ‚ÄÚPOSSESSED.‚ÄÙ A THIRD TYPE, HOWEVER, DOES NOT REACH THE END OF HIS MISTRUST AND DESIRE FOR HAVING EVEN SO: HE ASKS HIMSELF WHETHER THE WOMAN, WHEN SHE GIVES UP EVERYTHING FOR HIM, DOES NOT POSSIBLY DO THIS FOR A PHANTOM OF HIM. HE WANTS TO BE KNOWN DEEP DOWN, ABYSMALLY DEEP DOWN, BEFORE HE IS CAPABLE OF BEING LOVED AT ALL; HE DARES TO LET HIMSELF BE FATHOMED. HE FEELS THAT HIS BELOVED IS FULLY IN HIS POSSESSION ONLY WHEN SHE NO LONGER DECEIVES HERSELF ABOUT HIM, WHEN SHE LOVES HIM JUST AS MUCH FOR HIS DEVILRY AND HIDDEN INSATIABILITY AS FOR HIS GRACIOUSNESS, PATIENCE, AND SPIRITUALITY.

ONE TYPE WANTS TO POSSESS A PEOPLE‚ÄÎAND ALL THE HIGHER ARTS OF A CAGLIOSTRO AND CATILINE SUIT HIM TO THAT PURPOSE. SOMEONE ELSE, WITH A MORE SUBTLE THIRST FOR POSSESSION, SAYS TO HIMSELF: ‚ÄÚONE MAY NOT DECEIVE WHERE ONE WANTS TO POSSESS.‚ÄÙ THE IDEA THAT A MASK OF HIM MIGHT COMMAND THE HEART OF THE PEOPLE10 IRRITATES HIM AND MAKES HIM IMPATIENT: ‚ÄÚSO I MUST LET MYSELF BE KNOWN, AND FIRST MUST KNOW MYSELF.‚ÄÙ

AMONG HELPFUL AND CHARITABLE PEOPLE ONE ALMOST REGULARLY ENCOUNTERS THAT CLUMSY RUSE WHICH FIRST DOCTORS THE PERSON TO BE HELPED‚ÄÎAS IF, FOR EXAMPLE, HE ‚ÄÚDESERVED‚ÄÙ HELP, REQUIRED JUST THEIR HELP, AND WOULD PROVE TO BE PROFOUNDLY GRATEFUL FOR ALL HELP, FAITHFUL AND SUBMISSIVE. WITH THESE FANCIES THEY DISPOSE OF THE NEEDY AS OF POSSESSIONS, BEING CHARITABLE AND HELPFUL PEOPLE FROM A DESIRE FOR POSSESSIONS. ONE FINDS THEM JEALOUS IF ONE CROSSES OR ANTICIPATES THEM WHEN THEY WANT TO HELP.

INVOLUNTARILY, PARENTS TURN CHILDREN INTO SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THEMSELVES‚ÄÎTHEY CALL THAT ‚ÄÚEDUCATION.‚ÄÙ DEEP IN HER HEART, NO MOTHER DOUBTS THAT THE CHILD SHE HAS BORNE IS HER PROPERTY; NO FATHER CONTESTS HIS OWN RIGHT TO SUBJECT IT TO HIS CONCEPTS AND VALUATIONS. INDEED, FORMERLY IT SEEMED FAIR FOR FATHERS (AMONG THE ANCIENT GERMANS, FOR EXAMPLE) TO DECIDE ON THE LIFE OR DEATH OF THE NEWBORN AS THEY SAW FIT. AND LIKE THE FATHER, TEACHERS, CLASSES, PRIESTS, AND PRINCES STILL SEE, EVEN TODAY, IN EVERY NEW HUMAN BEING AN UNPROBLEMATIC OPPORTUNITY FOR ANOTHER POSSESSION. SO IT FOLLOWS‚ÄÎ

THE JEWS‚ÄÎA PEOPLE ‚ÄÚBORN FOR SLAVERY,‚ÄÙ AS TACITUS AND THE WHOLE ANCIENT WORLD SAY; ‚ÄÚTHE CHOSEN PEOPLE AMONG THE PEOPLES,‚ÄÙ AS THEY THEMSELVES SAY AND BELIEVE‚ÄÎTHE JEWS HAVE BROUGHT OFF THAT MIRACULOUS FEAT OF AN INVERSION OF VALUES, THANKS TO WHICH LIFE ON EARTH HAS ACQUIRED A NOVEL AND DANGEROUS ATTRACTION FOR A COUPLE OF MILLENNIA: THEIR PROPHETS HAVE FUSED ‚ÄÚRICH,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚGODLESS,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚEVIL,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚVIOLENT,‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚSENSUAL‚ÄÙ INTO ONE AND WERE THE FIRST TO USE THE WORD ‚ÄÚWORLD‚ÄÙ AS AN OPPROBRIUM. THIS INVERSION OF VALUES (WHICH INCLUDES USING THE WORD ‚ÄÚPOOR‚ÄÙ AS SYNONYMOUS WITH ‚ÄÚHOLY‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚFRIEND‚ÄÙ) CONSTITUTES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE: THEY MARK THE BEGINNING OF THE SLAVE REBELLION IN MORALS.11





196


COUNTLESS DARK BODIES ARE TO BE INFERRED NEAR THE SUN‚ÄÎAND WE SHALL NEVER SEE THEM. AMONG OURSELVES, THIS IS A PARABLE; AND A PSYCHOLOGIST OF MORALS READS THE WHOLE WRITING OF THE STARS ONLY AS A PARABLE- AND SIGN-LANGUAGE WHICH CAN BE USED TO BURY MUCH IN SILENCE.





197


WE MISUNDERSTAND THE BEAST OF PREY AND THE MAN OF PREY (FOR EXAMPLE, CESARE BORGIA)12 THOROUGHLY, WE MISUNDERSTAND ‚ÄÚNATURE,‚ÄÙ AS LONG AS WE STILL LOOK FOR SOMETHING ‚ÄÚPATHOLOGICAL‚ÄÙ AT THE BOTTOM OF THESE HEALTHIEST OF ALL TROPICAL MONSTERS AND GROWTHS, OR EVEN FOR SOME ‚ÄÚHELL‚ÄÙ THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE INNATE IN THEM; YET THIS IS WHAT ALMOST ALL MORALISTS SO FAR HAVE DONE. COULD IT BE THAT MORALISTS HARBOR A HATRED OF THE PRIMEVAL FOREST AND THE TROPICS? AND THAT THE ‚ÄÚTROPICAL MAN‚ÄÙ MUST BE DISCREDITED AT ANY PRICE, WHETHER AS SICKNESS AND DEGENERATION OF MAN OR AS HIS OWN HELL AND SELF-TORTURE? WHY? IN FAVOR OF THE ‚ÄÚTEMPERATE ZONES‚ÄÙ? IN FAVOR OF TEMPERATE MEN? OF THOSE WHO ARE ‚ÄÚMORAL‚ÄÙ? WHO ARE MEDIOCRE?‚ÄÎTHIS FOR THE CHAPTER ‚ÄÚMORALITY AS TIMIDITY.‚ÄÙ





198


ALL THESE MORALITIES THAT ADDRESS THEMSELVES TO THE INDIVIDUAL, FOR THE SAKE OF HIS ‚ÄÚHAPPINESS,‚ÄÙ AS ONE SAYS‚ÄÎWHAT ARE THEY BUT COUNSELS FOR BEHAVIOR IN RELATION TO THE DEGREE OF DANGEROUSNESS IN WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL LIVES WITH HIMSELF; RECIPES AGAINST HIS PASSIONS, HIS GOOD AND BAD INCLINATIONS INSOFAR AS THEY HAVE THE WILL TO POWER AND WANT TO PLAY THE MASTER; LITTLE AND GREAT PRUDENCES AND ARTIFICES THAT EXUDE THE NOOK ODOR OF OLD NOSTRUMS AND OF THE WISDOM OF OLD WOMEN; ALL OF THEM BAROQUE AND UNREASONABLE IN FORM‚ÄÎBECAUSE THEY ADDRESS THEMSELVES TO ‚ÄÚALL,‚ÄÙ BECAUSE THEY GENERALIZE WHERE ONE MUST NOT GENERALIZE. ALL OF THEM SPEAK UNCONDITIONALLY, TAKE THEMSELVES FOR UNCONDITIONAL, ALL OF THEM FLAVORED WITH MORE THAN ONE GRAIN OF SALT AND TOLERABLE ONLY‚ÄÎAT TIMES EVEN SEDUCTIVE‚ÄÎWHEN THEY BEGIN TO SMELL OVER-SPICED AND DANGEROUS, ESPECIALLY ‚ÄÚOF THE OTHER WORLD.‚ÄÙ ALL OF IT IS, MEASURED INTELLECTUALLY, WORTH VERY LITTLE AND NOT BY A LONG SHOT ‚ÄÚSCIENCE,‚ÄÙ MUCH LESS ‚ÄÚWISDOM,‚ÄÙ BUT RATHER, TO SAY IT ONCE MORE, THREE TIMES MORE, PRUDENCE, PRUDENCE, PRUDENCE, MIXED WITH STUPIDITY, STUPIDITY, STUPIDITY‚ÄÎWHETHER IT BE THAT INDIFFERENCE AND STATUE COLDNESS AGAINST THE HOT-HEADED FOLLY OF THE AFFECTS WHICH THE STOICS ADVISED AND ADMINISTERED; OR THAT LAUGHING-NO-MORE AND WEEPING-NO-MORE OF SPINOZA, HIS SO NAIVELY ADVOCATED DESTRUCTION OF THE AFFECTS THROUGH THEIR ANALYSIS AND VIVISECTION; OR THAT TUNING DOWN OF THE AFFECTS TO A HARMLESS MEAN ACCORDING TO WHICH THEY MAY BE SATISFIED, THE ARISTOTELIANISM OF MORALS; EVEN MORALITY AS ENJOYMENT OF THE AFFECTS IN A DELIBERATE THINNESS AND SPIRITUALIZATION BY MEANS OF THE SYMBOLISM OF ART, SAY, AS MUSIC, OR AS LOVE OF GOD AND OF MAN FOR GOD‚ÄÔS SAKE‚ÄÎFOR IN RELIGION THE PASSIONS ENJOY THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT‚ÄÎ; FINALLY EVEN THAT ACCOMMODATING AND PLAYFUL SURRENDER TO THE AFFECTS, AS HAFIZ AND GOETHE TAUGHT IT, THAT BOLD DROPPING OF THE REINS, THAT SPIRITUAL-PHYSICAL LICENTIA MORUM13 IN THE EXCEPTIONAL CASE OF WISE OLD OWLS AND SOTS14 FOR WHOM IT ‚ÄÚNO LONGER HOLDS MUCH DANGER.‚ÄÙ THIS, TOO, FOR THE CHAPTER ‚ÄÚMORALITY AS TIMIDITY.‚ÄÙ

INASMUCH AS AT ALL TIMES, AS LONG AS THERE HAVE BEEN HUMAN BEINGS, THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN HERDS OF MEN (CLANS, COMMUNITIES, TRIBES, PEOPLES, STATES, CHURCHES) AND ALWAYS A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WHO OBEYED, COMPARED WITH THE SMALL NUMBER OF THOSE COMMANDING‚ÄÎCONSIDERING, THEN, THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN EXERCISED AND CULTIVATED BETTER AND LONGER AMONG MEN SO FAR THAN OBEDIENCE‚ÄÎIT MAY FAIRLY BE ASSUMED THAT THE NEED FOR IT IS NOW INNATE IN THE AVERAGE MAN, AS A KIND OF FORMAL CONSCIENCE THAT COMMANDS: ‚ÄÚTHOU SHALT UNCONDITIONALLY DO SOMETHING, UNCONDITIONALLY NOT DO SOMETHING ELSE,‚ÄÙ IN SHORT, ‚ÄÚTHOU SHALT.‚ÄÙ THIS NEED SEEKS TO SATISFY ITSELF AND TO FILL ITS FORM WITH SOME CONTENT. ACCORDING TO ITS STRENGTH, IMPATIENCE, AND TENSION, IT SEIZES UPON THINGS AS A RUDE APPETITE, RATHER INDISCRIMINATELY, AND ACCEPTS WHATEVER IS SHOUTED INTO ITS EARS BY SOMEONE WHO ISSUES COMMANDS‚ÄÎPARENTS, TEACHERS, LAWS, CLASS PREJUDICES, PUBLIC OPINIONS.

THE STRANGE LIMITS OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, THE WAY IT HESITATES, TAKES SO LONG, OFTEN TURNS BACK, AND MOVES IN CIRCLES, IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE HERD INSTINCT OF OBEDIENCE IS INHERITED BEST, AND AT THE EXPENSE OF THE ART OF COMMANDING. IF WE IMAGINE THIS INSTINCT PROGRESSING FOR ONCE TO ITS ULTIMATE EXCESSES, THEN THOSE WHO COMMAND AND ARE INDEPENDENT WOULD EVENTUALLY BE LACKING ALTOGETHER; OR THEY WOULD SECRETLY SUFFER FROM A BAD CONSCIENCE AND WOULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO DECEIVE THEMSELVES BEFORE THEY COULD COMMAND‚ÄÎAS IF THEY, TOO, MERELY OBEYED. THIS STATE IS ACTUALLY ENCOUNTERED IN EUROPE TODAY: I CALL IT THE MORAL HYPOCRISY OF THOSE COMMANDING. THEY KNOW NO OTHER WAY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST THEIR BAD CONSCIENCE THAN TO POSE AS THE EXECUTORS OF MORE ANCIENT OR HIGHER COMMANDS (OF ANCESTORS, THE CONSTITUTION, OF RIGHT, THE LAWS, OR EVEN OF GOD). OR THEY EVEN BORROW HERD MAXIMS FROM THE HERD‚ÄÔS WAY OF THINKING, SUCH AS ‚ÄÚFIRST SERVANTS OF THEIR PEOPLE‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚINSTRUMENTS OF THE COMMON WEAL.‚ÄÙ

ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE HERD MAN IN EUROPE TODAY GIVES HIMSELF THE APPEARANCE OF BEING THE ONLY PERMISSIBLE KIND OF MAN, AND GLORIFIES HIS ATTRIBUTES, WHICH MAKE HIM TAME, EASY TO GET ALONG WITH, AND USEFUL TO THE HERD, AS IF THEY WERE THE TRULY HUMAN VIRTUES: NAMELY, PUBLIC SPIRIT, BENEVOLENCE, CONSIDERATION, INDUSTRIOUSNESS, MODERATION, MODESTY, INDULGENCE, AND PITY. IN THOSE CASES, HOWEVER, WHERE ONE CONSIDERS LEADERS AND BELLWETHERS INDISPENSABLE, PEOPLE TODAY MAKE ONE ATTEMPT AFTER ANOTHER TO ADD TOGETHER CLEVER HERD MEN BY WAY OF REPLACING COMMANDERS: ALL PARLIAMENTARY CONSTITUTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE THIS ORIGIN. NEVERTHELESS, THE APPEARANCE OF ONE WHO COMMANDS UNCONDITIONALLY STRIKES THESE HERD-ANIMAL EUROPEANS AS AN IMMENSE COMFORT AND SALVATION FROM A GRADUALLY INTOLERABLE PRESSURE, AS WAS LAST ATTESTED IN A MAJOR WAY BY THE EFFECT OF NAPOLEON‚ÄÔS APPEARANCE. THE HISTORY OF NAPOLEON‚ÄÔS RECEPTION IS ALMOST THE HISTORY OF THE HIGHER HAPPINESS ATTAINED BY THIS WHOLE CENTURY IN ITS MOST VALUABLE HUMAN BEINGS AND MOMENTS.

IN AN AGE OF DISINTEGRATION THAT MIXES RACES INDISCRIMINATELY, HUMAN BEINGS HAVE IN THEIR BODIES THE HERITAGE OF MULTIPLE ORIGINS, THAT IS, OPPOSITE, AND OFTEN NOT MERELY OPPOSITE, DRIVES AND VALUE STANDARDS THAT FIGHT EACH OTHER AND RARELY PERMIT EACH OTHER ANY REST. SUCH HUMAN BEINGS OF LATE CULTURES AND REFRACTED LIGHTS WILL ON THE AVERAGE BE WEAKER HUMAN BEINGS: THEIR MOST PROFOUND DESIRE IS THAT THE WAR THEY ARE SHOULD COME TO AN END. HAPPINESS APPEARS TO THEM, IN AGREEMENT WITH A TRANQUILIZING (FOR EXAMPLE, EPICUREAN OR CHRISTIAN) MEDICINE AND WAY OF THOUGHT, PRE-EMINENTLY AS THE HAPPINESS OF RESTING, OF NOT BEING DISTURBED, OF SATIETY, OF FINALLY ATTAINED UNITY, AS A ‚ÄÚSABBATH OF SABBATHS,‚ÄÙ TO SPEAK WITH THE HOLY RHETORICIAN AUGUSTINE WHO WAS HIMSELF SUCH A HUMAN BEING.

BUT WHEN THE OPPOSITION AND WAR IN SUCH A NATURE HAVE THE EFFECT OF ONE MORE CHARM AND INCENTIVE OF LIFE‚ÄÎAND IF, MOREOVER, IN ADDITION TO HIS POWERFUL AND IRRECONCILABLE DRIVES, A REAL MASTERY AND SUBTLETY IN WAGING WAR AGAINST ONESELF, IN OTHER WORDS, SELF-CONTROL, SELF-OUTWITTING, HAS BEEN INHERITED OR CULTIVATED, TOO‚ÄÎTHEN THOSE MAGICAL, INCOMPREHENSIBLE, AND UNFATHOMABLE ONES ARISE, THOSE ENIGMATIC MEN PREDESTINED FOR VICTORY AND SEDUCTION, WHOSE MOST BEAUTIFUL EXPRESSION IS FOUND IN ALCIBIADES AND CAESAR (TO WHOSE COMPANY I SHOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT FIRST EUROPEAN AFTER MY TASTE, THE HOHENSTAUFEN FREDERICK II),15 AND AMONG ARTISTS PERHAPS LEONARDO DA VINCI. THEY APPEAR IN PRECISELY THE SAME AGES WHEN THAT WEAKER TYPE WITH ITS DESIRE FOR REST COMES TO THE FORE: BOTH TYPES BELONG TOGETHER AND OWE THEIR ORIGIN TO THE SAME CAUSES.

AS LONG AS THE UTILITY REIGNING IN MORAL VALUE JUDGMENTS IS SOLELY THE UTILITY OF THE HERD, AS LONG AS ONE CONSIDERS ONLY THE PRESERVATION OF THE COMMUNITY, AND IMMORALITY IS SOUGHT EXACTLY AND EXCLUSIVELY IN WHAT SEEMS DANGEROUS TO THE SURVIVAL OF THE COMMUNITY‚ÄÎTHERE CAN BE NO MORALITY OF ‚ÄÚNEIGHBOR LOVE.‚ÄÙ SUPPOSING THAT EVEN THEN THERE WAS A CONSTANT LITTLE EXERCISE OF CONSIDERATION-PITY, FAIRNESS, MILDNESS, RECIPROCITY OF ASSISTANCE; SUPPOSING THAT EVEN IN THAT STATE OF SOCIETY ALL THOSE DRIVES ARE ACTIVE THAT LATER RECEIVE THE HONORARY DESIGNATION OF ‚ÄÚVIRTUES‚ÄÙ AND EVENTUALLY ALMOST COINCIDE WITH THE CONCEPT OF ‚ÄÚMORALITY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎIN THAT PERIOD THEY DO NOT YET AT ALL BELONG IN THE REALM OF MORAL VALUATIONS; THEY ARE STILL EXTRA-MORAL. AN ACT OF PITY, FOR EXAMPLE, WAS NOT CONSIDERED EITHER GOOD OR BAD, MORAL OR IMMORAL, IN THE BEST PERIOD OF THE ROMANS; AND EVEN WHEN IT WAS PRAISED, SUCH PRAISE WAS PERFECTLY COMPATIBLE WITH A KIND OF DISGRUNTLED DISDAIN AS SOON AS IT WAS JUXTAPOSED WITH AN ACTION THAT SERVED THE WELFARE OF THE WHOLE, OF THE RES PUBLICA.16

IN THE LAST ANALYSIS, ‚ÄÚLOVE OF THE NEIGHBOR‚ÄÙ IS ALWAYS SOMETHING SECONDARY, PARTLY CONVENTIONAL AND ARBITRARY-ILLUSORY IN RELATION TO FEAR OF THE NEIGHBOR. AFTER THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIETY IS FIXED ON THE WHOLE AND SEEMS SECURE AGAINST EXTERNAL DANGERS, IT IS THIS FEAR OF THE NEIGHBOR THAT AGAIN CREATES NEW PERSPECTIVES OF MORAL VALUATION. CERTAIN STRONG AND DANGEROUS DRIVES, LIKE AN ENTERPRISING SPIRIT, FOOLHARDINESS, VENGEFULNESS, CRAFTINESS, RAPACITY, AND THE LUST TO RULE, WHICH HAD SO FAR NOT MERELY BEEN HONORED INSOFAR AS THEY WERE SOCIALLY USEFUL‚ÄÎUNDER DIFFERENT NAMES, TO BE SURE, FROM THOSE CHOSEN HERE‚ÄÎBUT HAD TO BE TRAINED AND CULTIVATED TO MAKE THEM GREAT (BECAUSE ONE CONSTANTLY NEEDED THEM IN VIEW OF THE DANGERS TO THE WHOLE COMMUNITY, AGAINST THE ENEMIES OF THE COMMUNITY), ARE NOW EXPERIENCED AS DOUBLY DANGEROUS, SINCE THE CHANNELS TO DIVERT THEM ARE LACKING, AND, STEP UPON STEP, THEY ARE BRANDED AS IMMORAL AND ABANDONED TO SLANDER.

NOW THE OPPOSITE DRIVES AND INCLINATIONS RECEIVE MORAL HONORS; STEP UPON STEP, THE HERD INSTINCT DRAWS ITS CONCLUSIONS. HOW MUCH OR HOW LITTLE IS DANGEROUS TO THE COMMUNITY, DANGEROUS TO EQUALITY, IN AN OPINION, IN A STATE OR AFFECT, IN A WILL, IN A TALENT‚ÄÎTHAT NOW CONSTITUTES THE MORAL PERSPECTIVE: HERE, TOO, FEAR IS AGAIN THE MOTHER OF MORALS.

THE HIGHEST AND STRONGEST DRIVES, WHEN THEY BREAK OUT PASSIONATELY AND DRIVE THE INDIVIDUAL FAR ABOVE THE AVERAGE AND THE FLATS OF THE HERD CONSCIENCE, WRECK THE SELF-CONFIDENCE OF THE COMMUNITY, ITS FAITH IN ITSELF, AND IT IS AS IF ITS SPINE SNAPPED. HENCE JUST THESE DRIVES ARE BRANDED AND SLANDERED MOST. HIGH AND INDEPENDENT SPIRITUALITY, THE WILL TO STAND ALONE, EVEN A POWERFUL REASON ARE EXPERIENCED AS DANGERS; EVERYTHING THAT ELEVATES AN INDIVIDUAL ABOVE THE HERD AND INTIMIDATES THE NEIGHBOR IS HENCEFORTH CALLED EVIL; AND THE FAIR, MODEST, SUBMISSIVE, CONFORMING MENTALITY, THE MEDIOCRITY OF DESIRES ATTAINS MORAL DESIGNATIONS AND HONORS. EVENTUALLY, UNDER VERY PEACEFUL CONDITIONS, THE OPPORTUNITY AND NECESSITY FOR EDUCATING ONE‚ÄÔS FEELINGS TO SEVERITY AND HARDNESS IS LACKING MORE AND MORE; AND EVERY SEVERITY, EVEN IN JUSTICE, BEGINS TO DISTURB THE CONSCIENCE; ANY HIGH AND HARD NOBILITY AND SELF-RELIANCE IS ALMOST FELT TO BE AN INSULT AND AROUSES MISTRUST; THE ‚ÄÚLAMB,‚ÄÙ EVEN MORE THE ‚ÄÚSHEEP,‚ÄÙ GAINS IN RESPECT.

THERE IS A POINT IN THE HISTORY OF SOCIETY WHEN IT BECOMES SO PATHOLOGICALLY SOFT AND TENDER THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS IT SIDES EVEN WITH THOSE WHO HARM IT, CRIMINALS, AND DOES THIS QUITE SERIOUSLY AND HONESTLY. PUNISHING SOMEHOW SEEMS UNFAIR TO IT, AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT IMAGINING ‚ÄÚPUNISHMENT‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚBEING SUPPOSED TO PUNISH‚ÄÙ HURTS IT, AROUSES FEAR IN IT. ‚ÄÚIS IT NOT ENOUGH TO RENDER HIM UNDANGEROUS? WHY STILL PUNISH? PUNISHING ITSELF IS TERRIBLE.‚ÄÙ WITH THIS QUESTION, HERD MORALITY, THE MORALITY OF TIMIDITY, DRAWS ITS ULTIMATE CONSEQUENCE. SUPPOSING THAT ONE COULD ALTOGETHER ABOLISH DANGER, THE REASON FOR FEAR, THIS MORALITY WOULD BE ABOLISHED, TOO, EO IPSO: IT WOULD NO LONGER BE NEEDED, IT WOULD NO LONGER CONSIDER ITSELF NECESSARY.

WHOEVER EXAMINES THE CONSCIENCE OF THE EUROPEAN TODAY WILL HAVE TO PULL THE SAME IMPERATIVE OUT OF A THOUSAND MORAL FOLDS AND HIDEOUTS‚ÄÎTHE IMPERATIVE OF HERD TIMIDITY: ‚ÄÚWE WANT THAT SOME DAY THERE SHOULD BE NOTHING ANY MORE TO BE AFRAID OF!‚ÄÙ SOME DAY‚ÄÎTHROUGHOUT EUROPE, THE WILL AND WAY TO THIS DAY IS NOW CALLED ‚ÄÚPROGRESS.‚ÄÙ17

LET US IMMEDIATELY SAY ONCE MORE WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY SAID A HUNDRED TIMES, FOR TODAY‚ÄÔS EARS RESIST SUCH TRUTHS‚ÄÎOUR TRUTHS. WE KNOW WELL ENOUGH HOW INSULTING IT SOUNDS WHEN ANYBODY COUNTS MAN, UNADORNED AND WITHOUT METAPHOR, AMONG THE ANIMALS; BUT IT WILL BE CHARGED AGAINST US AS ALMOST A GUILT THAT PRECISELY FOR THE MEN OF ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS‚ÄÙ WE CONSTANTLY EMPLOY SUCH EXPRESSIONS AS ‚ÄÚHERD,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚHERD INSTINCTS,‚ÄÙ AND SO FORTH. WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT? WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING ELSE; FOR HERE EXACTLY LIES OUR NOVEL INSIGHT. WE HAVE FOUND THAT IN ALL MAJOR MORAL JUDGMENTS EUROPE IS NOW OF ONE MIND, INCLUDING EVEN THE COUNTRIES DOMINATED BY THE INFLUENCE OF EUROPE: PLAINLY, ONE NOW KNOWS IN EUROPE WHAT SOCRATES THOUGHT HE DID NOT KNOW AND WHAT THAT FAMOUS OLD SERPENT ONCE PROMISED TO TEACH‚ÄÎTODAY ONE ‚ÄÚKNOWS‚ÄÙ WHAT IS GOOD AND EVIL.18

NOW IT MUST SOUND HARSH AND CANNOT BE HEARD EASILY WHEN WE KEEP INSISTING: THAT WHICH HERE BELIEVES IT KNOWS, THAT WHICH HERE GLORIFIES ITSELF WITH ITS PRAISES AND REPROACHES, CALLING ITSELF GOOD, THAT IS THE INSTINCT OF THE HERD ANIMAL, MAN, WHICH HAS SCORED A BREAKTHROUGH AND ATTAINED PREVALENCE AND PREDOMINANCE OVER OTHER INSTINCTS‚ÄÎAND THIS DEVELOPMENT IS CONTINUING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GROWING PHYSIOLOGICAL APPROXIMATION AND ASSIMILATION OF WHICH IT IS THE SYMPTOM. MORALITY IN EUROPE TODAY IS HERD ANIMAL MORALITY‚ÄÎIN OTHER WORDS, AS WE UNDERSTAND IT, MERELY ONE TYPE OF HUMAN MORALITY BESIDE WHICH, BEFORE WHICH, AND AFTER WHICH MANY OTHER TYPES, ABOVE ALL HIGHER MORALITIES, ARE, OR OUGHT TO BE, POSSIBLE. BUT THIS MORALITY RESISTS SUCH A ‚ÄÚPOSSIBILITY,‚ÄÙ SUCH AN ‚ÄÚOUGHT‚ÄÙ WITH ALL ITS POWER: IT SAYS STUBBORNLY AND INEXORABLY, ‚ÄÚI AM MORALITY ITSELF, AND NOTHING BESIDES IS MORALITY.‚ÄÙ INDEED, WITH THE HELP OF A RELIGION WHICH INDULGED AND FLATTERED THE MOST SUBLIME HERD-ANIMAL DESIRES, WE HAVE REACHED THE POINT WHERE WE FIND EVEN IN POLITICAL AND SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS AN EVER MORE VISIBLE EXPRESSION OF THIS MORALITY: THE DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT IS THE HEIR OF THE CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT.

BUT THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT ITS TEMPO IS STILL MUCH TOO SLOW AND SLEEPY FOR THE MORE IMPATIENT, FOR THE SICK, THE SUFFERERS OF THE INSTINCT MENTIONED: WITNESS THE EVER MADDER HOWLING OF THE ANARCHIST DOGS WHO ARE BARING THEIR FANGS MORE AND MORE OBVIOUSLY AND ROAM THROUGH THE ALLEYS OF EUROPEAN CULTURE. THEY SEEM OPPOSITES OF THE PEACEFULLY INDUSTRIOUS DEMOCRATS AND IDEOLOGISTS OF REVOLUTION, AND EVEN MORE SO OF THE DOLTISH PHILOSOPHASTERS AND BROTHERHOOD ENTHUSIASTS WHO CALL THEMSELVES SOCIALISTS AND WANT A ‚ÄÚFREE SOCIETY;‚ÄÙ BUT IN FACT THEY ARE AT ONE WITH THE LOT IN THEIR THOROUGH AND INSTINCTIVE HOSTILITY TO EVERY OTHER FORM OF SOCIETY EXCEPT THAT OF THE AUTONOMOUS HERD (EVEN TO THE POINT OF REPUDIATING THE VERY CONCEPTS OF ‚ÄÚMASTER‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚSERVANT‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎNI DIEU NI MA√ÆTRE19 RUNS A SOCIALIST FORMULA). THEY ARE AT ONE IN THEIR TOUGH RESISTANCE TO EVERY SPECIAL CLAIM, EVERY SPECIAL RIGHT AND PRIVILEGE (WHICH MEANS IN THE LAST ANALYSIS, EVERY RIGHT: FOR ONCE ALL ARE EQUAL NOBODY NEEDS ‚ÄÚRIGHTS‚ÄÙ ANY MORE). THEY ARE AT ONE IN THEIR MISTRUST OF PUNITIVE JUSTICE (AS IF IT WERE A VIOLATION OF THOSE WHO ARE WEAKER, A WRONG AGAINST THE NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF ALL PREVIOUS SOCIETY). BUT THEY ARE ALSO AT ONE IN THE RELIGION OF PITY, IN FEELING WITH ALL WHO FEEL, LIVE, AND SUFFER (DOWN TO THE ANIMAL, UP TO ‚ÄÚGOD‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHE EXCESS OF A ‚ÄÚPITY WITH GOD‚ÄÙ BELONGS IN A DEMOCRATIC AGE). THEY ARE AT ONE, THE LOT OF THEM, IN THE CRY AND THE IMPATIENCE OF PITY, IN THEIR DEADLY HATRED OF SUFFERING GENERALLY, IN THEIR ALMOST FEMININE INABILITY TO REMAIN SPECTATORS, TO LET SOMEONE SUFFER. THEY ARE AT ONE IN THEIR INVOLUNTARY PLUNGE INTO GLOOM AND UNMANLY TENDERNESS UNDER WHOSE SPELL EUROPE SEEMS THREATENED BY A NEW BUDDHISM. THEY ARE AT ONE IN THEIR FAITH IN THE MORALITY OF SHARED PITY, AS IF THAT WERE MORALITY IN ITSELF, BEING THE HEIGHT, THE ATTAINED HEIGHT OF MAN, THE SOLE HOPE OF THE FUTURE, THE CONSOLATION OF PRESENT MAN, THE GREAT ABSOLUTION FROM ALL FORMER GUILT. THEY ARE AT ONE, THE LOT OF THEM, IN THEIR FAITH IN THE COMMUNITY AS THE SAVIOR, IN SHORT, IN THE HERD, IN ‚ÄÚTHEMSELVES‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎ

WE HAVE A DIFFERENT FAITH; TO US THE DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT IS NOT ONLY A FORM OF THE DECAY OF POLITICAL ORGANIZATION BUT A FORM OF THE DECAY, NAMELY THE DIMINUTION, OF MAN, MAKING HIM MEDIOCRE AND LOWERING HIS VALUE. WHERE, THEN, MUST WE REACH WITH OUR HOPES?

TOWARD NEW PHILOSOPHERS; THERE IS NO CHOICE; TOWARD SPIRITS STRONG AND ORIGINAL ENOUGH TO PROVIDE THE STIMULI FOR OPPOSITE VALUATIONS AND TO REVALUE AND INVERT ‚ÄÚETERNAL VALUES;‚ÄÙ TOWARD FORERUNNERS, TOWARD MEN OF THE FUTURE WHO IN THE PRESENT TIE THE KNOT AND CONSTRAINT THAT FORCES THE WILL OF MILLENNIA UPON NEW TRACKS. TO TEACH MAN THE FUTURE OF MAN AS HIS WILL, AS DEPENDENT ON A HUMAN WILL, AND TO PREPARE GREAT VENTURES AND OVER-ALL ATTEMPTS OF DISCIPLINE AND CULTIVATION BY WAY OF PUTTING AN END TO THAT GRUESOME DOMINION OF NONSENSE AND ACCIDENT THAT HAS SO FAR BEEN CALLED ‚ÄÚHISTORY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHE NONSENSE OF THE ‚ÄÚGREATEST NUMBER‚ÄÙ IS MERELY ITS ULTIMATE FORM: AT SOME TIME NEW TYPES OF PHILOSOPHERS AND COMMANDERS WILL BE NECESSARY FOR THAT, AND WHATEVER HAS EXISTED ON EARTH OF CONCEALED, TERRIBLE, AND BENEVOLENT SPIRITS, WILL LOOK PALE AND DWARFED BY COMPARISON. IT IS THE IMAGE OF SUCH LEADERS THAT WE ENVISAGE: MAY I SAY THIS OUT LOUD, YOU FREE SPIRITS? THE CONDITIONS THAT ONE WOULD HAVE PARTLY TO CREATE AND PARTLY TO EXPLOIT FOR THEIR GENESIS; THE PROBABLE WAYS AND TESTS THAT WOULD ENABLE A SOUL TO GROW TO SUCH A HEIGHT AND FORCE THAT IT WOULD FEEL THE COMPULSION FOR SUCH TASKS; A REVALUATION OF VALUES UNDER WHOSE NEW PRESSURE AND HAMMER A CONSCIENCE WOULD BE STEELED, A HEART TURNED TO BRONZE, IN ORDER TO ENDURE THE WEIGHT OF SUCH RESPONSIBILITY; ON THE OTHER HAND, THE NECESSITY OF SUCH LEADERS, THE FRIGHTENING DANGER THAT THEY MIGHT FAIL TO APPEAR OR THAT THEY MIGHT TURN OUT BADLY OR DEGENERATE‚ÄÎTHESE ARE OUR REAL WORRIES AND GLOOM‚ÄÎDO YOU KNOW THAT, YOU FREE SPIRITS?‚ÄÎTHESE ARE THE HEAVY DISTANT THOUGHTS AND STORMS THAT PASS OVER THE SKY OF OUR LIFE.

THERE ARE FEW PAINS AS SORE AS ONCE HAVING SEEN, GUESSED, FELT HOW AN EXTRAORDINARY HUMAN BEING STRAYED FROM HIS PATH AND DEGENERATED.20 BUT ANYONE WHO HAS THE RARE EYE FOR THE OVER-ALL DANGER THAT ‚ÄÚMAN‚ÄÙ HIMSELF DEGENERATES; ANYONE WHO, LIKE US, HAS RECOGNIZED THE MONSTROUS FORTUITY THAT HAS SO FAR HAD ITS WAY AND PLAY REGARDING THE FUTURE OF MAN‚ÄÎA GAME IN WHICH NO HAND, AND NOT EVEN A FINGER, OF GOD TOOK PART AS A PLAYER; ANYONE WHO FATHOMS THE CALAMITY THAT LIES CONCEALED IN THE ABSURD GUILELESSNESS AND BLIND CONFIDENCE OF ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS‚ÄÙ AND EVEN MORE IN THE WHOLE CHRISTIAN-EUROPEAN MORALITY‚ÄÎSUFFERS FROM AN ANXIETY THAT IS PAST ALL COMPARISONS. WITH A SINGLE GLANCE HE SEES WHAT, GIVEN A FAVORABLE ACCUMULATION AND INCREASE OF FORCES AND TASKS, MIGHT YET BE MADE OF MAN; HE KNOWS WITH ALL THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HOW MAN IS STILL UNEXHAUSTED FOR THE GREATEST POSSIBILITIES AND HOW OFTEN THE TYPE ‚ÄÚMAN‚ÄÙ HAS ALREADY CONFRONTED ENIGMATIC DECISIONS AND NEW PATHS‚ÄÎHE KNOWS STILL BETTER FROM HIS MOST PAINFUL MEMORIES WHAT WRETCHED THINGS HAVE SO FAR USUALLY BROKEN A BEING OF THE HIGHEST RANK THAT WAS IN THE PROCESS OF BECOMING, SO THAT IT BROKE, SANK, AND BECAME CONTEMPTIBLE.

THE OVER-ALL DEGENERATION OF MAN DOWN TO WHAT TODAY APPEARS TO THE SOCIALIST DOLTS AND FLATHEADS AS THEIR ‚ÄÚMAN OF THE FUTURE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAS THEIR IDEAL‚ÄÎTHIS DEGENERATION AND DIMINUTION OF MAN INTO THE PERFECT HERD ANIMAL (OR, AS THEY SAY, TO THE MAN OF THE ‚ÄÚFREE SOCIETY‚ÄÙ), THIS ANIMALIZATION OF MAN INTO THE DWARF ANIMAL OF EQUAL RIGHTS AND CLAIMS, IS POSSIBLE, THERE IS NO DOUBT OF IT. ANYONE WHO HAS ONCE THOUGHT THROUGH THIS POSSIBILITY TO THE END KNOWS ONE KIND OF NAUSEA THAT OTHER MEN DON‚ÄÔT KNOW‚ÄÎBUT PERHAPS ALSO A NEW TASK!‚ÄÎ

SCHLECHTA‚ÄÔS EDITION, WHICH PURPORTS TO FOLLOW THE ORIGINAL EDITION, ACTUALLY DEPARTS EVEN A LITTLE FURTHER FROM IT THAN THE MUSARIONAUSGABE: ‚ÄÚDAS PRINCIP‚ÄÙ SAGT ER (S. 137 DER GRUNDPROBLEME DER ETHIK), ‚ÄÚDER GRUNDSATZ ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

THE CORRECT TITLE OF SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS BOOK IS DIE BEIDEN GRUNDPROBLEME DER ETHIK (THE TWO FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS OF ETHICS), AND IN THE ORIGINAL EDITION OF 1841 THE QUOTED PASSAGE IS FOUND. NIETZSCHE NEITHER PLACED THE TITLE IN QUOTES NOR ITALICIZED IT, AND HIS SLIGHT VARIATION OF THE TITLE IS LESS ODD THAN THE FACT THAT ON SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS OWN TITLE PAGE OF 1841 THE TITLE OF THE SECOND ESSAY, WHICH NIETZSCHE CITES, IS GIVEN AS ‚ÄÚUEBER DAS FUNDAMENT DER MORAL, NICHT GEKR√∂NT VON DER K. D√§NISCHEN SOCIET√§T DER WISSENSCHAFTEN, ZU KOPENHAGEN, DEN 30. JANUAR 1840‚ÄÙ (‚ÄÚON THE FOUNDATION OF MORALS, NOT AWARDED A PRIZE BY THE DANISH ROYAL SOCIETY ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ). TURNING THE PAGE, ONE FINDS THE TABLE OF CONTENTS, IN WHICH THE TITLE OF THE SECOND ESSAY IS GIVEN AS FOLLOWS: ‚ÄÚPREISSCHRIFT √ºBER DIE GRUNDLAGE DER MORAL‚ÄÙ (PRIZE ESSAY ON THE BASIS OF MORALS). (THE HEADING AGREES WITH THE TABLE OF CONTENTS, NOT WITH SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS TITLE PAGE.) IF SCHOPENHAUER COULD SAY IN ONE INSTANCE FUNDAMENT AND IN THE OTHER GRUNDLAGE, NIETZSCHE MIGHT AS WELL SAY MORAL INSTEAD OF ETHIK; MOREOVER, THE WORD IN THE TITLE THAT CONCERNED NIETZSCHE WAS MORAL, NOT ETHIK.

THE EDITORS WHO CHANGED THE TITLE AND PAGE REFERENCE GIVEN BY NIETZSCHE FAILED TO INSERT THREE DOTS IN THE QUOTATION ITSELF, TO INDICATE A MINOR OMISSION OF TWO AND A HALF LINES BETWEEN ‚ÄÚAGREED‚ÄÙ AND THE LATIN QUOTATION.

AT THE RISK THAT MORALIZING WILL HERE, TOO, TURN OUT TO BE WHAT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN‚ÄÎNAMELY, ACCORDING TO BALZAC, AN INTREPID MONTRER SES PLAIES2‚ÄÎI VENTURE TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST AN UNSEEMLY AND HARMFUL SHIFT IN THE RESPECTIVE RANKS OF SCIENCE3 AND PHILOSOPHY, WHICH IS NOW THREATENING TO BECOME ESTABLISHED, QUITE UNNOTICED AND AS IF IT WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A PERFECTLY GOOD CONSCIENCE. I AM OF THE OPINION THAT ONLY EXPERIENCE‚ÄÎEXPERIENCE ALWAYS SEEMS TO MEAN BAD EXPERIENCE?‚ÄÎCAN ENTITLE US TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DISCUSSION OF SUCH HIGHER QUESTIONS OF RANK, LEST WE TALK LIKE BLIND MEN ABOUT COLORS‚ÄÎAGAINST SCIENCE THE WAY WOMEN AND ARTISTS DO (‚ÄÚOH, THIS DREADFUL SCIENCE!‚ÄÙ SIGH THEIR INSTINCT AND EMBARRASSMENT; ‚ÄÚIT ALWAYS GETS TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS!‚ÄÙ).

THE SCHOLAR‚ÄÔS4 DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, HIS EMANCIPATION FROM PHILOSOPHY, IS ONE OF THE MORE REFINED EFFECTS OF THE DEMOCRATIC ORDER‚ÄÎAND DISORDER: THE SELF-GLORIFICATION AND SELF-EXALTATION OF SCHOLARS5 NOW STAND IN FULL BLOOM, IN THEIR FINEST SPRING, EVERYWHERE‚ÄÎWHICH IS NOT MEANT TO IMPLY THAT IN THIS CASE SELF-PRAISE SMELLS PLEASANT.6 ‚ÄÚFREEDOM FROM ALL MASTERS!‚ÄÙ THAT IS WHAT THE INSTINCT OF THE RABBLE WANTS IN THIS CASE, TOO; AND AFTER SCIENCE HAS MOST HAPPILY RID ITSELF OF THEOLOGY WHOSE ‚ÄÚHANDMAID‚ÄÙ IT WAS TOO LONG, IT NOW AIMS WITH AN EXCESS OF HIGH SPIRITS AND A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING TO LAY DOWN LAWS FOR PHILOSOPHY AND TO PLAY THE ‚ÄÚMASTER‚ÄÙ HERSELF‚ÄÎWHAT AM I SAYING? THE PHILOSOPHER.

MY MEMORY‚ÄÎTHE MEMORY OF A SCIENTIFIC MAN, IF YOU‚ÄÔLL FORGIVE ME‚ÄÎIS BULGING WITH NA√ØVET√©S OF OVERBEARING THAT I HAVE HEARD ABOUT PHILOSOPHY AND PHILOSOPHERS FROM THE LIPS OF YOUNG NATURAL SCIENTISTS AND OLD PHYSICIANS (NOT TO SPEAK OF THE MOST LEARNED7 AND CONCEITED8 OF ALL SCHOLARS, THE PHILOLOGISTS AND SCHOOLMEN, WHO ARE BOTH BY PROFESSION). SOMETIMES IT WAS THE SPECIALIST AND NOOK DWELLER WHO INSTINCTIVELY RESISTED ANY KIND OF SYNTHETIC ENTERPRISE AND TALENT; SOMETIMES THE INDUSTRIOUS WORKER WHO HAD GOT A WHIFF OF OTIUM9 AND THE NOBLE RICHES IN THE PSYCHIC ECONOMY OF THE PHILOSOPHER WHICH HAD MADE HIM FEEL DEFENSIVE AND SMALL. SOMETIMES IT WAS THAT COLOR BLINDNESS OF THE UTILITY MAN WHO SEES NOTHING IN PHILOSOPHY BUT A SERIES OF REFUTED SYSTEMS AND A PRODIGAL EFFORT THAT ‚ÄÚDOES NOBODY ANY GOOD.‚ÄÙ SOMETIMES THE FEAR OF MASKED MYSTICISM AND A CORRECTION OF THE LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE LEAPED FORWARD; SOMETIMES LACK OF RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUAL PHILOSOPHERS THAT HAD INVOLUNTARILY GENERALIZED ITSELF INTO LACK OF RESPECT FOR PHILOSOPHY.

MOST FREQUENTLY, FINALLY, I FOUND AMONG YOUNG SCHOLARS THAT WHAT LAY BEHIND THE ARROGANT CONTEMPT FOR PHILOSOPHY WAS THE BAD AFTEREFFECT OF‚ÄÎA PHILOSOPHER TO WHOM THEY NOW DENIED ALLEGIANCE ON THE WHOLE WITHOUT, HOWEVER, HAVING BROKEN THE SPELL OF HIS CUTTING EVALUATION OF OTHER PHILOSOPHERS‚ÄÎWITH THE RESULT OF AN OVER-ALL IRRITATION WITH ALL PHILOSOPHY. (SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS AFTEREFFECT ON OUR MOST MODERN GERMANY, FOR EXAMPLE, SEEMS TO ME TO BE OF THIS KIND: WITH HIS UNINTELLIGENT WRATH AGAINST HEGEL10 HE HAS SUCCEEDED IN WRENCHING THE WHOLE LAST GENERATION OF GERMANS OUT OF THE CONTEXT OF GERMAN CULTURE‚ÄÎA CULTURE THAT WAS, CONSIDERING EVERYTHING, AN ELEVATION AND DIVINATORY SUBTLETY OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE. BUT PRECISELY AT THIS POINT SCHOPENHAUER WAS POOR, UNRECEPTIVE, AND UN-GERMAN TO THE POINT OF GENIUS.)

ALTOGETHER, TAKING A LARGE VIEW, IT MAY HAVE BEEN ABOVE ALL WHAT WAS HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMAN, IN SHORT, THE WRETCHEDNESS OF THE MOST RECENT PHILOSOPHY ITSELF THAT MOST THOROUGHLY DAMAGED RESPECT FOR PHILOSOPHY AND OPENED THE GATES TO THE INSTINCT OF THE RABBLE. LET US CONFESS HOW UTTERLY OUR MODERN WORLD LACKS THE WHOLE TYPE11 OF A HERACLITUS, PLATO, EMPEDOCLES, AND WHATEVER OTHER NAMES THESE ROYAL AND MAGNIFICENT HERMITS OF THE SPIRIT HAD; AND HOW IT IS WITH CONSIDERABLE JUSTIFICATION THAT, CONFRONTED WITH SUCH REPRESENTATIVES OF PHILOSOPHY AS ARE TODAY, THANKS TO FASHION, AS MUCH ON TOP AS THEY ARE REALLY AT THE BOTTOM‚ÄÎIN GERMANY, FOR EXAMPLE, THE TWO LIONS OF BERLIN, THE ANARCHIST EUGEN D√ºHRING AND THE AMALGAMIST EDUARD VON HARTMANN12‚ÄÎA SOLID MAN OF SCIENCE MAY FEEL THAT HE IS OF A BETTER TYPE AND DESCENT. IT IS ESPECIALLY THE SIGHT OF THOSE HODGEPODGE PHILOSOPHERS WHO CALL THEMSELVES ‚ÄÚPHILOSOPHERS OF REALITY‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚPOSITIVISTS‚ÄÙ THAT IS CAPABLE OF INJECTING A DANGEROUS MISTRUST INTO THE SOUL OF AN AMBITIOUS YOUNG SCHOLAR: THESE ARE AT BEST SCHOLARS AND SPECIALISTS THEMSELVES‚ÄÎTHAT IS PALPABLE‚ÄÎTHEY ARE ALL LOSERS WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BACK UNDER THE HEGEMONY OF SCIENCE, AFTER HAVING DESIRED MORE OF THEMSELVES AT SOME TIME WITHOUT HAVING HAD THE RIGHT TO THIS ‚ÄÚMORE‚ÄÙ AND ITS RESPONSIBILITIES‚ÄÎAND WHO NOW REPRESENT, IN WORD AND DEED, HONORABLY, RESENTFULLY, AND VENGEFULLY, THE UNBELIEF IN THE MASTERLY TASK AND MASTERFULNESS OF PHILOSOPHY.

FINALLY: HOW COULD IT REALLY BE OTHERWISE? SCIENCE IS FLOURISHING TODAY AND HER GOOD CONSCIENCE IS WRITTEN ALL OVER HER FACE, WHILE THE LEVEL TO WHICH ALL MODERN PHILOSOPHY HAS GRADUALLY SUNK, THIS REST OF PHILOSOPHY TODAY, INVITES MISTRUST AND DISPLEASURE, IF NOT MOCKERY AND PITY. PHILOSOPHY REDUCED TO ‚ÄÚTHEORY OF KNOWLEDGE,‚ÄÙ IN FACT NO MORE THAN A TIMID EPOCHISM AND DOCTRINE OF ABSTINENCE‚ÄÎA PHILOSOPHY THAT NEVER GETS BEYOND THE THRESHOLD AND TAKES PAINS TO DENY ITSELF THE RIGHT TO ENTER‚ÄÎTHAT IS PHILOSOPHY IN ITS LAST THROES, AN END, AN AGONY, SOMETHING INSPIRING PITY. HOW COULD SUCH A PHILOSOPHY‚ÄÎDOMINATE!

THE DANGERS FOR A PHILOSOPHER‚ÄÔS DEVELOPMENT ARE INDEED SO MANIFOLD TODAY THAT ONE MAY DOUBT WHETHER THIS FRUIT CAN STILL RIPEN AT ALL. THE SCOPE AND THE TOWER-BUILDING OF THE SCIENCES HAS GROWN TO BE ENORMOUS, AND WITH THIS ALSO THE PROBABILITY THAT THE PHILOSOPHER GROWS WEARY WHILE STILL LEARNING OR ALLOWS HIMSELF TO BE DETAINED SOMEWHERE TO BECOME A ‚ÄÚSPECIALIST‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎSO HE NEVER ATTAINS HIS PROPER LEVEL, THE HEIGHT FOR A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK, FOR LOOKING AROUND, FOR LOOKING DOWN. OR HE ATTAINS IT TOO LATE, WHEN HIS BEST TIME AND STRENGTH ARE SPENT‚ÄÎOR IMPAIRED, COARSENED, DEGENERATED, SO HIS VIEW, HIS OVER-ALL VALUE JUDGMENT DOES NOT MEAN MUCH ANY MORE. IT MAY BE PRECISELY THE SENSITIVITY OF HIS INTELLECTUAL CONSCIENCE THAT LEADS HIM TO DELAY SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY AND TO BE LATE: HE IS AFRAID OF THE SEDUCTION TO BECOME A DILETTANTE, A MILLIPEDE, AN INSECT WITH A THOUSAND ANTENNAE; HE KNOWS TOO WELL THAT WHOEVER HAS LOST HIS SELF-RESPECT CANNOT COMMAND OR LEAD IN THE REALM OF KNOWLEDGE‚ÄÎUNLESS HE WOULD LIKE TO BECOME A GREAT ACTOR, A PHILOSOPHICAL CAGLIOSTRO AND PIED PIPER, IN SHORT, A SEDUCER. THIS IS IN THE END A QUESTION OF TASTE, EVEN IF IT WERE NOT A QUESTION OF CONSCIENCE.

ADD TO THIS, BY WAY OF ONCE MORE DOUBLING THE DIFFICULTIES FOR A PHILOSOPHER, THAT HE DEMANDS OF HIMSELF A JUDGMENT, A YES OR NO, NOT ABOUT THE SCIENCES BUT ABOUT LIFE AND THE VALUE OF LIFE‚ÄÎTHAT HE IS RELUCTANT TO COME TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAS A RIGHT, OR EVEN A DUTY, TO SUCH A JUDGMENT, AND MUST SEEK HIS WAY TO THIS RIGHT AND FAITH ONLY FROM THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE‚ÄÎPERHAPS MOST DISTURBING AND DESTRUCTIVE13‚ÄÎEXPERIENCES, AND FREQUENTLY HESITATES, DOUBTS, AND LAPSES INTO SILENCE.

INDEED, THE CROWD HAS FOR A LONG TIME MISJUDGED AND MISTAKEN THE PHILOSOPHER, WHETHER FOR A SCIENTIFIC MAN AND IDEAL SCHOLAR OR FOR A RELIGIOUSLY ELEVATED, DESENSUALIZED,14 ‚ÄÚDESECULARIZED‚ÄÙ ENTHUSIAST AND SOT OF GOD.15 AND IF A MAN IS PRAISED TODAY FOR LIVING ‚ÄÚWISELY‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚAS A PHILOSOPHER,‚ÄÙ IT HARDLY MEANS MORE THAN ‚ÄÚPRUDENTLY AND APART.‚ÄÙ WISDOM‚ÄÎSEEMS TO THE RABBLE A KIND OF ESCAPE, A MEANS AND TRICK FOR GETTING WELL OUT OF A WICKED GAME. BUT THE GENUINE PHILOSOPHER‚ÄÎAS IT SEEMS TO US, MY FRIENDS?‚ÄÎLIVES ‚ÄÚUNPHILOSOPHICALLY‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚUNWISELY,‚ÄÙ ABOVE ALL IMPRUDENTLY, AND FEELS THE BURDEN AND THE DUTY OF A HUNDRED ATTEMPTS AND TEMPTATIONS OF LIFE‚ÄÎHE RISKS HIMSELF CONSTANTLY, HE PLAYS THE WICKED GAME‚ÄÎ





206


COMPARED TO A GENIUS‚ÄÎTHAT IS, TO ONE WHO EITHER BEGETS OR GIVES BIRTH, TAKING BOTH TERMS IN THEIR MOST ELEVATED SENSE‚ÄÎTHE SCHOLAR, THE SCIENTIFIC AVERAGE MAN, ALWAYS RATHER RESEMBLES AN OLD MAID: LIKE HER HE IS NOT CONVERSANT WITH THE TWO MOST VALUABLE FUNCTIONS OF MAN. INDEED, ONE EVEN CONCEDES TO BOTH, TO THE SCHOLARS AND TO OLD MAIDS, AS IT WERE BY WAY OF A COMPENSATION, THAT THEY ARE RESPECTABLE‚ÄÎONE STRESSES THEIR RESPECTABILITY‚ÄÎAND YET FEELS ANNOYED ALL OVER AT HAVING TO MAKE THIS CONCESSION.

LET US LOOK MORE CLOSELY: WHAT IS THE SCIENTIFIC MAN? TO BEGIN WITH, A TYPE OF MAN THAT IS NOT NOBLE, WITH THE VIRTUES OF A TYPE OF MAN THAT IS NOT NOBLE, WHICH IS TO SAY, A TYPE THAT DOES NOT DOMINATE AND IS NEITHER AUTHORITATIVE NOR SELF-SUFFICIENT: HE HAS INDUSTRIOUS-NESS, PATIENT ACCEPTANCE OF HIS PLACE IN RANK AND FILE, EVENNESS AND MODERATION IN HIS ABILITIES AND NEEDS, AN INSTINCT FOR HIS EQUALS AND FOR WHAT THEY NEED; FOR EXAMPLE, THAT BIT OF INDEPENDENCE AND GREEN PASTURE WITHOUT WHICH THERE IS NO QUIET WORK, THAT CLAIM TO HONOR AND RECOGNITION (WHICH FIRST OF ALL PRESUPPOSES LITERAL RECOGNITION AND RECOGNIZABILITY), THAT SUNSHINE OF A GOOD NAME, THAT CONSTANT ATTESTATION OF HIS VALUE AND UTILITY WHICH IS NEEDED TO OVERCOME AGAIN AND AGAIN THE INTERNAL MISTRUST WHICH IS THE SEDIMENT IN THE HEARTS OF ALL DEPENDENT MEN AND HERD ANIMALS.

THE SCHOLAR ALSO HAS, AS IS ONLY FAIR, THE DISEASES AND BAD MANNERS OF A TYPE THAT IS NOT NOBLE: HE IS RICH IN PETTY ENVY AND HAS LYNX EYES FOR WHAT IS BASE IN NATURES TO WHOSE HEIGHTS HE CANNOT ATTAIN. HE IS FAMILIAR, BUT ONLY LIKE THOSE WHO LET THEMSELVES GO, NOT FLOW; AND JUST BEFORE THOSE WHO FLOW LIKE GREAT CURRENTS HE FREEZES AND BECOMES DOUBLY RESERVED: HIS EYE BECOMES LIKE A SMOOTH AND RELUCTANT LAKE WITH NOT A RIPPLE OF DELIGHT OR SYMPATHY. THE WORST AND MOST DANGEROUS THING OF WHICH SCHOLARS ARE CAPABLE COMES FROM THEIR SENSE OF THE MEDIOCRITY OF THEIR OWN TYPE‚ÄÎFROM THAT JESUITISM OF MEDIOCRITY WHICH INSTINCTIVELY WORKS AT THE ANNIHILATION OF THE UNCOMMON MAN AND TRIES TO BREAK EVERY BENT BOW OR, PREFERABLY, TO UNBEND IT. UNBENDING‚ÄÎCONSIDERATELY, OF COURSE, WITH A SOLICITOUS HAND‚ÄÎUNBENDING WITH FAMILIAR PITY, THAT IS THE CHARACTERISTIC ART OF JESUITISM WHICH HAS ALWAYS KNOWN HOW TO INTRODUCE ITSELF AS A RELIGION OF PITY.‚ÄÎ





207


HOWEVER GRATEFULLY WE MAY WELCOME AN OBJECTIVE SPIRIT‚ÄÎAND IS THERE ANYONE WHO HAS NEVER BEEN MORTALLY SICK OF EVERYTHING SUBJECTIVE AND OF HIS ACCURSED IPSISSIMOSITY?16‚ÄÎIN THE END WE ALSO HAVE TO LEARN CAUTION AGAINST OUR GRATITUDE AND PUT A HALT TO THE EXAGGERATED MANNER IN WHICH THE ‚ÄÚUNSELFING‚ÄÙ AND DEPERSONALIZATION OF THE SPIRIT IS BEING CELEBRATED NOWADAYS AS IF IT WERE THE GOAL ITSELF AND REDEMPTION AND TRANSFIGURATION. THIS IS PARTICULARLY CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PESSIMIST‚ÄÔS SCHOOL, WHICH ALSO HAS GOOD REASONS FOR ACCORDING THE HIGHEST HONORS TO ‚ÄÚDISINTERESTED KNOWLEDGE.‚ÄÙ

THE OBJECTIVE PERSON WHO NO LONGER CURSES AND SCOLDS LIKE THE PESSIMIST, THE IDEAL SCHOLAR IN WHOM THE SCIENTIFIC INSTINCT, AFTER THOUSANDS OF TOTAL AND SEMI-FAILURES, FOR ONCE BLOSSOMS AND BLOOMS TO THE END, IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST PRECIOUS INSTRUMENTS THERE ARE; BUT HE BELONGS IN THE HAND OF ONE MORE POWERFUL. HE IS ONLY AN INSTRUMENT; LET US SAY, HE IS A MIRROR‚ÄÎHE IS NO ‚ÄÚEND IN HIMSELF.‚ÄÙ THE OBJECTIVE MAN IS INDEED A MIRROR: HE IS ACCUSTOMED TO SUBMIT BEFORE WHATEVER WANTS TO BE KNOWN, WITHOUT ANY OTHER PLEASURE THAN THAT FOUND IN KNOWING AND ‚ÄÚMIRRORING;‚ÄÙ HE WAITS UNTIL SOMETHING COMES, AND THEN SPREADS HIMSELF OUT TENDERLY LEST LIGHT FOOTSTEPS AND THE QUICK PASSAGE OF SPIRITLIKE BEINGS SHOULD BE LOST ON HIS PLANE AND SKIN.

WHATEVER STILL REMAINS IN HIM OF A ‚ÄÚPERSON‚ÄÙ STRIKES HIM AS ACCIDENTAL, OFTEN ARBITRARY, STILL MORE OFTEN DISTURBING: TO SUCH AN EXTENT HAS HE BECOME A PASSAGEWAY AND REFLECTION OF STRANGE FORMS AND EVENTS EVEN TO HIMSELF. HE RECOLLECTS ‚ÄÚHIMSELF‚ÄÙ ONLY WITH AN EFFORT AND OFTEN MISTAKENLY; HE EASILY CONFUSES HIMSELF WITH OTHERS, HE ERRS ABOUT HIS OWN NEEDS AND IS IN THIS RESPECT ALONE UNSUBTLE AND SLOVENLY. PERHAPS HIS HEALTH TORMENTS HIM, OR THE PETTINESS AND CRAMPED ATMOSPHERE OF WIFE AND FRIEND, OR THE LACK OF COMPANIONS AND COMPANY‚ÄÎYES, HE FORCES HIMSELF TO REFLECT ON HIS TORMENTS‚ÄÎIN VAIN. ALREADY HIS THOUGHTS ROAM‚ÄÎTO A MORE GENERAL CASE, AND TOMORROW HE KNOWS NO MORE THAN HE DID YESTERDAY HOW HE MIGHT BE HELPED. HE HAS LOST ANY SERIOUSNESS FOR HIMSELF, ALSO TIME: HE IS CHEERFUL, NOT FOR LACK OF DISTRESS, BUT FOR LACK OF FINGERS AND HANDLES FOR HIS NEED. HIS HABIT OF MEETING EVERY THING AND EXPERIENCE HALFWAY, THE SUNNY AND IMPARTIAL HOSPITALITY WITH WHICH HE ACCEPTS EVERYTHING THAT COMES HIS WAY, HIS TYPE OF UNSCRUPULOUS BENEVOLENCE, OF DANGEROUS UNCONCERN ABOUT YES AND NO‚ÄÎALAS, THERE ARE CASES ENOUGH IN WHICH HE HAS TO PAY FOR THESE VIRTUES! AND AS A HUMAN BEING HE BECOMES ALL TOO EASILY THE CAPUT MORTUUM17 OF THESE VIRTUES.

IF LOVE AND HATRED ARE WANTED FROM HIM‚ÄÎI MEAN LOVE AND HATRED AS GOD, WOMAN, AND ANIMAL UNDERSTAND THEM‚ÄÎHE WILL DO WHAT HE CAN AND GIVE WHAT HE CAN. BUT ONE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF IT IS NOT MUCH‚ÄÎIF JUST HERE HE PROVES INAUTHENTIC, FRAGILE, QUESTIONABLE, AND WORM-EATEN. HIS LOVE IS FORCED, HIS HATRED ARTIFICIAL AND RATHER UN TOUR DE FORCE, A LITTLE VANITY AND EXAGGERATION. AFTER ALL, HE IS GENUINE ONLY INSOFAR AS HE MAY BE OBJECTIVE: ONLY IN HIS CHEERFUL ‚ÄÚTOTALISM‚ÄÙ HE IS STILL ‚ÄÚNATURE‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚNATURAL.‚ÄÙ HIS MIRROR SOUL, ETERNALLY SMOOTHING ITSELF OUT, NO LONGER KNOWS HOW TO AFFIRM OR NEGATE; HE DOES NOT COMMAND, NEITHER DOES HE DESTROY. ‚ÄÚJE NE M√©PRISE PRESQUE RIEN‚ÄÙ18 HE SAYS WITH LEIBNIZ: ONE SHOULD NOT OVERLOOK AND UNDERESTIMATE THAT PRESQUE.19

NEITHER IS HE A MODEL MAN; HE DOES NOT GO BEFORE ANYONE, NOR BEHIND; ALTOGETHER HE PLACES HIMSELF TOO FAR APART TO HAVE ANY REASON TO TAKE SIDES FOR GOOD OR EVIL. WHEN CONFUSING HIM FOR SO LONG WITH THE PHILOSOPHER, WITH THE CAESARIAN CULTIVATOR AND CULTURAL DYNAMO,20 ONE ACCORDED HIM FAR TOO HIGH HONORS AND OVERLOOKED HIS MOST ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS: HE IS AN INSTRUMENT, SOMETHING OF A SLAVE THOUGH CERTAINLY THE MOST SUBLIME TYPE OF SLAVE, BUT IN HIMSELF NOTHING‚ÄÎPRESQUE RIEN! THE OBJECTIVE MAN IS AN INSTRUMENT, A PRECIOUS, EASILY INJURED AND CLOUDED INSTRUMENT FOR MEASURING AND, AS AN ARRANGEMENT OF MIRRORS, AN ARTISTIC TRIUMPH THAT DESERVES CARE AND HONOR; BUT HE IS NO GOAL, NO CONCLUSION AND SUNRISE,21 NO COMPLEMENTARY MAN IN WHOM THE REST OF EXISTENCE IS JUSTIFIED, NO TERMINATION‚ÄÎAND STILL LESS A BEGINNING, A BEGETTING AND FIRST CAUSE, NOTHING TOUGH, POWERFUL, SELF-RELIANT THAT WANTS TO BE MASTER‚ÄÎRATHER ONLY A DELICATE, CAREFULLY DUSTED, FINE, MOBILE POT FOR FORMS THAT STILL HAS TO WAIT FOR SOME CONTENT AND SUBSTANCE IN ORDER TO ‚ÄÚSHAPE‚ÄÙ ITSELF ACCORDINGLY‚ÄÎFOR THE MOST PART, A MAN WITHOUT SUBSTANCE AND CONTENT, A ‚ÄÚSELFLESS‚ÄÙ MAN. CONSEQUENTLY, ALSO NOTHING FOR WOMEN, IN PARENTHESI.‚ÄÎ





208


WHEN A PHILOSOPHER SUGGESTS THESE DAYS THAT HE IS NOT A SKEPTIC‚ÄÎI HOPE THIS IS CLEAR FROM THE DESCRIPTION JUST GIVEN OF THE OBJECTIVE SPIRIT‚ÄÎEVERYBODY IS ANNOYED. ONE BEGINS TO LOOK AT HIM APPREHENSIVELY, ONE WOULD LIKE TO ASK, TO ASK SO MUCH‚ÄÎINDEED, AMONG TIMID LISTENERS, OF WHOM THERE ARE LEGIONS NOW, HE IS HENCEFORTH CONSIDERED DANGEROUS. IT IS AS IF AT HIS REJECTION OF SKEPTICISM THEY HEARD SOME EVIL, MENACING RUMBLING IN THE DISTANCE, AS IF A NEW EXPLOSIVE WERE BEING TRIED SOMEWHERE, A DYNAMITE OF THE SPIRIT, PERHAPS A NEWLY DISCOVERED RUSSIAN NIHILINE,22 A PESSIMISM BONAE VOLUNTATIS23 THAT DOES NOT MERELY SAY NO, WANT NO, BUT‚ÄÎHORRIBLE THOUGHT!‚ÄÎDOES NO.

AGAINST THIS TYPE OF ‚ÄÚGOOD WILL‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎA WILL TO THE ACTUAL, ACTIVE DENIAL OF LIFE‚ÄÎTHERE IS TODAY, ACCORDING TO COMMON CONSENT, NO BETTER SOPORIFIC AND SEDATIVE THAN, SKEPTICISM, THE GENTLE, FAIR, LULLING POPPY OF SKEPTICISM; AND EVEN HAMLET IS NOW PRESCRIBED BY THE DOCTORS OF THE DAY AGAINST THE ‚ÄÚSPIRIT‚ÄÙ24 AND ITS UNDERGROUND RUMBLINGS. ‚ÄÚAREN‚ÄÔT OUR EARS FILLED WITH WICKED NOISES AS IT IS?‚ÄÙ ASKS THE SKEPTIC AS A FRIEND OF QUIET, AND ALMOST AS A KIND OF SECURITY POLICE; ‚ÄÚTHIS SUBTERRANEAN NO IS TERRIBLE! BE STILL AT LAST, YOU PESSIMISTIC MOLES!‚ÄÙ

FOR THE SKEPTIC, BEING A DELICATE CREATURE, IS FRIGHTENED ALL TOO EASILY; HIS CONSCIENCE IS TRAINED TO QUIVER AT EVERY NO, INDEED EVEN AT A YES THAT IS DECISIVE AND HARD, AND TO FEEL AS IF IT HAD BEEN BITTEN.25 YES AND NO‚ÄÎTHAT GOES AGAINST HIS MORALITY; CONVERSELY, HE LIKES TO TREAT HIS VIRTUE TO A FEAST OF NOBLE ABSTINENCE, SAY, BY REPEATING MONTAIGNE‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚWHAT DO I KNOW?‚ÄÙ OR SOCRATES‚ÄÔ ‚ÄÚI KNOW THAT I KNOW NOTHING.‚ÄÙ OR: ‚ÄÚHERE I DON‚ÄÔT TRUST MYSELF, HERE NO DOOR IS OPEN TO ME.‚ÄÙ OR: ‚ÄÚEVEN IF ONE WERE OPEN, WHY ENTER RIGHT AWAY?‚ÄÙ OR: ‚ÄÚWHAT USE ARE ALL RASH HYPOTHESES? ENTERTAINING NO HYPOTHESES AT ALL MIGHT WELL BE PART OF GOOD TASTE. MUST YOU INSIST ON IMMEDIATELY STRAIGHTENING WHAT IS CROOKED? ON FILLING UP EVERY HOLE WITH OAKUM? ISN‚ÄÔT THERE TIME? DOESN‚ÄÔT TIME HAVE TIME? O YOU DEVILISH BROOD, ARE YOU INCAPABLE OF WAITING? THE UNCERTAIN HAS ITS CHARMS, TOO; THE SPHINX, TOO, IS A CIRCE; CIRCE, TOO, WAS A PHILOSOPHER.‚ÄÙ

THUS A SKEPTIC CONSOLES HIMSELF; AND IT IS TRUE THAT HE STANDS IN NEED OF SOME CONSOLATION. FOR SKEPTICISM IS THE MOST SPIRITUAL EXPRESSION OF A CERTAIN COMPLEX PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITION THAT IN ORDINARY LANGUAGE IS CALLED NERVOUS EXHAUSTION AND SICKLINESS; IT ALWAYS DEVELOPS WHEN RACES OR CLASSES THAT HAVE LONG BEEN SEPARATED ARE CROSSED SUDDENLY AND DECISIVELY. IN THE NEW GENERATION THAT, AS IT WERE, HAS INHERITED IN ITS BLOOD DIVERSE STANDARDS AND VALUES, EVERYTHING IS UNREST, DISTURBANCE, DOUBT, ATTEMPT; THE BEST FORCES HAVE AN INHIBITING EFFECT, THE VERY VIRTUES DO NOT ALLOW EACH OTHER TO GROW AND BECOME STRONG; BALANCE, A CENTER OF GRAVITY, AND PERPENDICULAR POISE ARE LACKING IN BODY AND SOUL. BUT WHAT BECOMES SICKEST AND DEGENERATES MOST IN SUCH HYBRIDS IS THE WILL: THEY NO LONGER KNOW INDEPENDENCE OF DECISIONS AND THE INTREPID SENSE OF PLEASURE IN WILLING‚ÄÎTHEY DOUBT THE ‚ÄÚFREEDOM OF THE WILL‚ÄÙ EVEN IN THEIR DREAMS.

OUR EUROPE OF TODAY, BEING THE ARENA OF AN ABSURDLY SUDDEN ATTEMPT AT A RADICAL MIXTURE OF CLASSES, AND HENCE RACES, IS THEREFORE SKEPTICAL IN ALL ITS HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS‚ÄÎSOMETIMES WITH THAT MOBILE SKEPTICISM WHICH LEAPS IMPATIENTLY AND LASCIVIOUSLY FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH, SOMETIMES DISMAL LIKE A CLOUD OVERCHARGED WITH QUESTION MARKS‚ÄÎAND OFTEN MORTALLY SICK OF ITS WILL. PARALYSIS OF THE WILL: WHERE TODAY DOES ONE NOT FIND THIS CRIPPLE SITTING? AND OFTEN IN SUCH FINERY! HOW SEDUCTIVE THE FINERY LOOKS! THIS DISEASE ENJOYS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL POMP- AND LIE-COSTUMES; AND MOST OF WHAT TODAY DISPLAYS ITSELF IN THE SHOWCASES, FOR EXAMPLE, AS ‚ÄÚOBJECTIVITY,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚBEING SCIENTIFIC,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚL‚ÄÔART POUR L‚ÄÔART,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚPURE KNOWLEDGE, FREE OF WILL,‚ÄÙ IS MERELY DRESSED-UP SKEPTICISM AND PARALYSIS OF THE WILL: FOR THIS DIAGNOSIS OF THE EUROPEAN SICKNESS I VOUCH.

THE SICKNESS OF THE WILL IS SPREAD UNEVENLY OVER EUROPE: IT APPEARS STRONGEST AND MOST MANIFOLD WHERE CULTURE HAS BEEN AT HOME LONGEST; IT DISAPPEARS TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE ‚ÄÚBARBARIAN‚ÄÙ STILL‚ÄÎOR AGAIN‚ÄÎCLAIMS HIS RIGHTS UNDER THE LOOSE GARMENTS OF WESTERN CULTURE. IN FRANCE TODAY THE WILL IS ACCORDINGLY MOST SERIOUSLY SICK, WHICH IS AS EASY TO INFER AS IT IS PALPABLE. AND FRANCE, HAVING ALWAYS POSSESSED A MASTERLY SKILL AT CONVERTING EVEN THE MOST CALAMITOUS TURNS OF ITS SPIRIT INTO SOMETHING ATTRACTIVE AND SEDUCTIVE, NOW REALLY SHOWS ITS CULTURAL SUPERIORITY OVER EUROPE BY BEING THE SCHOOL AND DISPLAY OF ALL THE CHARMS OF SKEPTICISM.

THE STRENGTH TO WILL, AND TO WILL SOMETHING FOR A LONG TIME, IS A LITTLE GREATER IN GERMANY, AND MORE SO IN THE GERMAN NORTH THAN IN THE CENTER OF GERMANY; BUT MUCH STRONGER YET IN ENGLAND, SPAIN, AND CORSICA, HERE IN ASSOCIATION WITH INDOLENCE, THERE WITH HARD HEADS‚ÄÎNOT TO SPEAK OF ITALY, WHICH IS TOO YOUNG TO KNOW WHAT IT WANTS AND STILL HAS TO PROVE WHETHER IT IS ABLE TO WILL‚ÄÎBUT IT IS STRONGEST AND MOST AMAZING BY FAR IN THAT ENORMOUS EMPIRE IN BETWEEN, WHERE EUROPE, AS IT WERE, FLOWS BACK INTO ASIA, IN RUSSIA. THERE THE STRENGTH TO WILL HAS LONG BEEN ACCUMULATED AND STORED UP, THERE THE WILL‚ÄÎUNCERTAIN WHETHER AS A WILL TO NEGATE OR A WILL TO AFFIRM‚ÄÎIS WAITING MENACINGLY TO BE DISCHARGED, TO BORROW A PET PHRASE OF OUR PHYSICISTS TODAY. IT MAY WELL TAKE MORE THAN INDIAN WARS AND COMPLICATIONS IN ASIA TO RID EUROPE OF ITS GREATEST DANGER: INTERNAL UPHEAVALS WOULD BE NEEDED, TOO, THE SHATTERING OF THE EMPIRE INTO SMALL UNITS, AND ABOVE ALL THE INTRODUCTION OF THE PARLIAMENTARY NONSENSE, INCLUDING THE OBLIGATION FOR EVERYBODY TO READ HIS NEWSPAPER WITH HIS BREAKFAST.

I DO NOT SAY THIS BECAUSE I WANT IT TO HAPPEN: THE OPPOSITE WOULD BE RATHER MORE AFTER MY HEART‚ÄÎI MEAN SUCH AN INCREASE IN THE MENACE OF RUSSIA THAT EUROPE WOULD HAVE TO RESOLVE TO BECOME MENACING, TOO, NAMELY, TO ACQUIRE ONE WILL BY MEANS OF A NEW CASTE THAT WOULD RULE EUROPE, A LONG, TERRIBLE WILL OF ITS OWN THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO CAST ITS GOALS MILLENNIA HENCE‚ÄÎSO THE LONG-DRAWN-OUT COMEDY OF ITS MANY SPLINTER STATES AS WELL AS ITS DYNASTIC AND DEMOCRATIC SPLINTER WILLS WOULD COME TO AN END. THE TIME FOR PETTY POLITICS IS OVER: THE VERY NEXT CENTURY WILL BRING THE FIGHT FOR THE DOMINION OF THE EARTH‚ÄÎTHE COMPULSION TO LARGE-SCALE POLITICS.





209


TO WHAT EXTENT THE NEW WARLIKE AGE INTO WHICH WE EUROPEANS HAVE EVIDENTLY ENTERED MAY ALSO FAVOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANOTHER AND STRONGER TYPE OF SKEPTICISM, ON THAT I WANT TO COMMENT FOR THE PRESENT ONLY IN THE FORM OF A PARABLE WHICH THOSE WHO LIKE GERMAN HISTORY SHOULD UNDERSTAND READILY. THAT UNSCRUPULOUS ENTHUSIAST FOR HANDSOME AND VERY TALL GRENADIERS WHO, AS KING OF PRUSSIA,26 BROUGHT INTO BEING A MILITARY AND SKEPTICAL GENIUS‚ÄÎAND THUS, WHEN YOU COME RIGHT DOWN TO IT, THAT NEW TYPE OF GERMAN WHICH HAS JUST NOW COME TO THE TOP TRIUMPHANTLY‚ÄÎTHE QUESTIONABLE, MAD FATHER OF FREDERICK THE GREAT HIMSELF HAD THE KNACK AND LUCKY CLAW OF GENIUS, THOUGH ONLY AT ONE POINT: HE KNEW WHAT WAS MISSING IN GERMANY AT THAT TIME, AND WHAT LACK WAS A HUNDRED TIMES MORE CRITICAL AND URGENT THAN, SAY, THE LACK OF EDUCATION AND SOCIAL GRACES‚ÄÎHIS ANTIPATHY AGAINST THE YOUNG FREDERICK CAME FROM THE FEAR OF A DEEP INSTINCT. MEN WERE MISSING; AND HE SUSPECTED WITH THE MOST BITTER DISMAY THAT HIS OWN SON WAS NOT MAN ENOUGH. IN THIS HE WAS DECEIVED: BUT WHO, IN HIS PLACE, WOULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE DECEIVED HIMSELF ABOUT THAT? HE SAW HIS SON SURRENDER TO ATHEISM, TO ESPRIT, TO THE HEDONISTIC FRIVOLITY OF CLEVER FRENCHMEN: IN THE BACKGROUND HE SAW THAT GREAT VAMPIRE, THE SPIDER OF SKEPTICISM; HE SUSPECTED THE INCURABLE MISERY OF A HEART THAT IS NO LONGER HARD ENOUGH FOR EVIL OR GOOD, OF A BROKEN WILL THAT NO LONGER COMMANDS, NO LONGER IS CAPABLE OF COMMANDING. MEANWHILE THERE GREW UP IN HIS SON THAT MORE DANGEROUS AND HARDER NEW TYPE OF SKEPTICISM‚ÄÎWHO KNOWS HOW MUCH IT OWED PRECISELY TO THE HATRED OF THE FATHER AND THE ICY MELANCHOLY OF A WILL CONDEMNED TO SOLITUDE?‚ÄÎTHE SKEPTICISM OF AUDACIOUS MANLINESS WHICH IS MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO THE GENIUS FOR WAR AND CONQUEST AND FIRST ENTERED GERMANY IN THE SHAPE OF THE GREAT FREDERICK.

THIS SKEPTICISM DESPISES AND NEVERTHELESS SEIZES; IT UNDERMINES AND TAKES POSSESSION; IT DOES NOT BELIEVE BUT DOES NOT LOSE ITSELF IN THE PROCESS; IT GIVES THE SPIRIT DANGEROUS FREEDOM, BUT IT IS SEVERE ON THE HEART; IT IS THE GERMAN FORM OF SKEPTICISM WHICH, IN THE FORM OF A CONTINUED FREDERICKIANISM THAT HAD BEEN SUBLIMATED SPIRITUALLY, BROUGHT EUROPE FOR A LONG TIME UNDER THE HEGEMONY OF THE GERMAN SPIRIT AND ITS CRITICAL AND HISTORICAL MISTRUST. THANKS TO THE UNCONQUERABLY STRONG AND TOUGH VIRILITY OF THE GREAT GERMAN PHILOLOGISTS AND CRITICAL HISTORIANS (VIEWED PROPERLY, ALL OF THEM WERE ALSO ARTISTS OF DESTRUCTION AND DISSOLUTION), A NEW CONCEPT OF THE GERMAN SPIRIT CRYSTALLIZED GRADUALLY IN SPITE OF ALL ROMANTICISM IN MUSIC AND PHILOSOPHY, AND THE INCLINATION TO VIRILE SKEPTICISM BECAME A DECISIVE TRAIT, NOW, FOR EXAMPLE, AS AN INTREPID EYE, NOW AS THE COURAGE AND HARDNESS OF ANALYSIS, AS THE TOUGH WILL TO UNDERTAKE DANGEROUS JOURNEYS OF EXPLORATION AND SPIRITUALIZED NORTH POLE EXPEDITIONS UNDER DESOLATE AND DANGEROUS SKIES.27

THERE MAY BE GOOD REASONS WHY WARMBLOODED AND SUPERFICIAL HUMANITARIANS CROSS THEMSELVES JUST WHEN THEY BEHOLD THIS SPIRIT‚ÄÎCET ESPRIT FATALISTE, IRONIQUE, M√©PHISTOPH√©LIQUE,28 MICHELET CALLS IT, NOT WITHOUT A SHUDDER. BUT IF WE WANT TO REALLY FEEL WHAT A DISTINCTION SUCH FEAR OF THE ‚ÄÚMAN‚ÄÙ IN THE GERMAN SPIRIT CONFERS‚ÄÎA SPIRIT THROUGH WHICH EUROPE WAS AFTER ALL AWAKENED FROM HER ‚ÄÚDOGMATIC SLUMBER‚ÄÙ29‚ÄÎWE HAVE TO REMEMBER THE FORMER CONCEPTION WHICH WAS REPLACED BY THIS ONE: IT WAS NOT SO LONG AGO THAT A MASCULINIZED WOMAN COULD DARE WITH UNBRIDLED PRESUMPTION TO COMMEND THE GERMANS TO THE SYMPATHY OF EUROPE AS BEING GENTLE, GOODHEARTED, WEAK-WILLED, AND POETIC DOLTS.30 AT LONG LAST WE OUGHT TO UNDERSTAND DEEPLY ENOUGH NAPOLEON‚ÄÔS SURPRISE WHEN HE CAME TO SEE GOETHE: IT SHOWS WHAT PEOPLE HAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE ‚ÄÚGERMAN SPIRIT‚ÄÙ FOR CENTURIES. ‚ÄÚVOIL√† UN HOMME!‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT MEANT: ‚ÄÚBUT THIS IS A MAN! AND I HAD MERELY EXPECTED A GERMAN.‚ÄÙ31‚ÄÎ

SUPPOSE THEN THAT SOME TRAIT IN THE IMAGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS OF THE FUTURE POSES THE RIDDLE WHETHER THEY WOULD NOT PERHAPS HAVE TO BE SKEPTICS IN THE SENSE SUGGESTED LAST, THIS WOULD STILL DESIGNATE ONLY ONE FEATURE AND NOT THEM AS A WHOLE. WITH JUST AS MUCH RIGHT ONE COULD CALL THEM CRITICS: AND CERTAINLY THEY WILL BE MEN OF EXPERIMENTS.32 WITH THE NAME IN WHICH I DARED TO BAPTIZE THEM I HAVE ALREADY STRESSED EXPRESSLY THEIR ATTEMPTS AND DELIGHT IN ATTEMPTS: WAS THIS DONE BECAUSE AS CRITICS IN BODY AND SOUL THEY LIKE TO EMPLOY EXPERIMENTS IN A NEW, PERHAPS WIDER, PERHAPS MORE DANGEROUS SENSE? DOES THEIR PASSION FOR KNOWLEDGE FORCE THEM TO GO FURTHER WITH AUDACIOUS AND PAINFUL EXPERIMENTS THAN THE SOFTHEARTED AND EFFEMINATE TASTE OF A DEMOCRATIC CENTURY COULD APPROVE?

NO DOUBT, THESE COMING PHILOSOPHERS WILL BE LEAST ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH THOSE SERIOUS AND BY NO MEANS UNPROBLEMATIC QUALITIES WHICH DISTINGUISH THE CRITIC FROM THE SKEPTIC; I MEAN THE CERTAINTY OF VALUE STANDARDS, THE DELIBERATE EMPLOYMENT OF A UNITY OF METHOD, A SHREWD COURAGE, THE ABILITY TO STAND ALONE AND GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THEMSELVES. INDEED, THEY ADMIT TO A PLEASURE IN SAYING NO AND IN TAKING THINGS APART, AND TO A CERTAIN LEVELHEADED CRUELTY THAT KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE A KNIFE SURELY AND SUBTLY, EVEN WHEN THE HEART BLEEDS. THEY WILL BE HARDER (AND PERHAPS NOT ALWAYS ONLY AGAINST THEMSELVES) THAN HUMANE PEOPLE MIGHT WISH; THEY WILL NOT DALLY WITH ‚ÄÚTRUTH‚ÄÙ TO BE ‚ÄÚPLEASED‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚELEVATED‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚINSPIRED‚ÄÙ BY HER. ON THE CONTRARY, THEY WILL HAVE LITTLE FAITH THAT TRUTH OF ALL THINGS SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH AMUSEMENTS FOR OUR FEELINGS.

THEY WILL SMILE, THESE SEVERE SPIRITS, IF SOMEBODY SHOULD SAY IN FRONT OF THEM: ‚ÄÚTHIS THOUGHT ELEVATES ME; HOW COULD IT FAIL TO BE TRUE?‚ÄÙ OR: ‚ÄÚTHIS WORK DELIGHTS ME; HOW COULD IT FAIL TO BE BEAUTIFUL?‚ÄÙ OR: ‚ÄÚTHIS ARTIST MAKES ME GREATER; HOW COULD HE FAIL TO BE GREAT?‚ÄÙ PERHAPS THEY DO NOT MERELY HAVE A SMILE BUT FEEL A GENUINE NAUSEA OVER EVERYTHING THAT IS ENTHUSIASTIC, IDEALISTIC, FEMININE, HERMAPHRODITIC IN THIS VEIN. AND WHOEVER KNEW HOW TO FOLLOW THEM INTO THE MOST SECRET CHAMBERS OF THEIR HEARTS WOULD SCARCELY FIND ANY INTENTION THERE TO RECONCILE ‚ÄÚCHRISTIAN FEELINGS‚ÄÙ WITH ‚ÄÚCLASSICAL TASTE‚ÄÙ AND POSSIBLY EVEN WITH ‚ÄÚMODERN PARLIAMENTARISM‚ÄÙ (THOUGH SUCH CONCILIATORY ATTEMPTS ARE SAID TO OCCUR EVEN AMONG PHILOSOPHERS IN OUR VERY UNSURE AND CONSEQUENTLY VERY CONCILIATORY CENTURY).

CRITICAL DISCIPLINE AND EVERY HABIT THAT IS CONDUCIVE TO CLEANLINESS AND SEVERITY IN MATTERS OF THE SPIRIT WILL BE DEMANDED BY THESE PHILOSOPHERS NOT ONLY OF THEMSELVES: THEY COULD DISPLAY THEM AS THEIR KIND OF JEWELS‚ÄÎNEVERTHELESS THEY STILL DO NOT WANT TO BE CALLED CRITICS ON THAT ACCOUNT. THEY CONSIDER IT NO SMALL DISGRACE FOR PHILOSOPHY WHEN PEOPLE DECREE, AS IS POPULAR NOWADAYS: ‚ÄÚPHILOSOPHY ITSELF IS CRITICISM AND CRITICAL SCIENCE‚ÄÎAND NOTHING WHATEVER BESIDES.‚ÄÙ THIS EVALUATION OF PHILOSOPHY MAY ELICIT APPLAUSE FROM ALL THE POSITIVISTS OF FRANCE AND GERMANY (AND IT MIGHT EVEN HAVE PLEASED THE HEART AND TASTE OF KANT‚ÄÎONE SHOULD REMEMBER THE TITLES OF HIS MAJOR WORKS); OUR NEW PHILOSOPHERS WILL SAY NEVERTHELESS: CRITICS ARE INSTRUMENTS OF THE PHILOSOPHER AND FOR THAT VERY REASON, BEING INSTRUMENTS, A LONG WAYS FROM BEING PHILOSOPHERS THEMSELVES. EVEN THE GREAT CHINESE OF K√∂NIGSBERG33 WAS MERELY A GREAT CRITIC.‚ÄÎ





211


I INSIST THAT PEOPLE SHOULD FINALLY STOP CONFOUNDING PHILOSOPHICAL LABORERS, AND SCIENTIFIC MEN GENERALLY, WITH PHILOSOPHERS; PRECISELY AT THIS POINT WE SHOULD BE STRICT ABOUT GIVING ‚ÄÚEACH HIS DUE,‚ÄÙ AND NOT FAR TOO MUCH TO THOSE AND FAR TOO LITTLE TO THESE.

IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THE EDUCATION OF A GENUINE PHILOSOPHER THAT HE HIMSELF HAS ALSO ONCE STOOD ON ALL THESE STEPS ON WHICH HIS SERVANTS, THE SCIENTIFIC LABORERS OF PHILOSOPHY, REMAIN STANDING‚ÄÎHAVE TO REMAIN STANDING. PERHAPS HE HIMSELF MUST HAVE BEEN CRITIC AND SKEPTIC AND DOGMATIST AND HISTORIAN AND ALSO POET AND COLLECTOR AND TRAVELER AND SOLVER OF RIDDLES AND MORALIST AND SEER AND ‚ÄÚFREE SPIRIT‚ÄÙ AND ALMOST EVERYTHING IN ORDER TO PASS THROUGH THE WHOLE RANGE OF HUMAN VALUES AND VALUE FEELINGS AND TO BE ABLE TO SEE WITH MANY DIFFERENT EYES AND CONSCIENCES, FROM A HEIGHT AND INTO EVERY DISTANCE, FROM THE DEPTHS INTO EVERY HEIGHT, FROM A NOOK INTO EVERY EXPANSE. BUT ALL THESE ARE MERELY PRECONDITIONS OF HIS TASK: THIS TASK ITSELF DEMANDS SOMETHING DIFFERENT‚ÄÎIT DEMANDS THAT HE CREATE VALUES.

THOSE PHILOSOPHICAL LABORERS AFTER THE NOBLE MODEL OF KANT AND HEGEL HAVE TO DETERMINE AND PRESS INTO FORMULAS, WHETHER IN THE REALM OF LOGIC OR POLITICAL (MORAL) THOUGHT OR ART, SOME GREAT DATA OF VALUATIONS‚ÄÎTHAT IS, FORMER POSITINGS OF VALUES, CREATIONS OF VALUE WHICH HAVE BECOME DOMINANT AND ARE FOR A TIME CALLED ‚ÄÚTRUTHS.‚ÄÙ IT IS FOR THESE INVESTIGATORS TO MAKE EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED AND BEEN ESTEEMED SO FAR EASY TO LOOK OVER, EASY TO THINK OVER, INTELLIGIBLE AND MANAGEABLE, TO ABBREVIATE EVERYTHING LONG, EVEN ‚ÄÚTIME,‚ÄÙ AND TO OVERCOME THE ENTIRE PAST‚ÄÎAN ENORMOUS AND WONDERFUL TASK IN WHOSE SERVICE EVERY SUBTLE PRIDE, EVERY TOUGH WILL CAN CERTAINLY FIND SATISFACTION. GENUINE PHILOSOPHERS, HOWEVER, ARE COMMANDERS AND LEGISLATORS: THEY SAY, ‚ÄÚTHUS IT SHALL BE!‚ÄÙ THEY FIRST DETERMINE THE WHITHER AND FOR WHAT OF MAN, AND IN SO DOING HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL THE PRELIMINARY LABOR OF ALL PHILOSOPHICAL LABORERS, ALL WHO HAVE OVERCOME THE PAST. WITH A CREATIVE HAND THEY REACH FOR THE FUTURE, AND ALL THAT IS AND HAS BEEN BECOMES A MEANS FOR THEM, AN INSTRUMENT, A HAMMER. THEIR ‚ÄÚKNOWING‚ÄÙ IS CREATING, THEIR CREATING IS A LEGISLATION, THEIR WILL TO TRUTH IS‚ÄÎWILL TO POWER.

ARE THERE SUCH PHILOSOPHERS TODAY? HAVE THERE BEEN SUCH PHILOSOPHERS YET? MUST THERE NOT BE SUCH PHILOSOPHERS?34‚ÄÎ





212


MORE AND MORE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE PHILOSOPHER, BEING OF NECESSITY A MAN OF TOMORROW AND THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, HAS ALWAYS FOUND HIMSELF, AND HAD TO FIND HIMSELF, IN CONTRADICTION TO HIS TODAY: HIS ENEMY WAS EVER THE IDEAL OF TODAY. SO FAR ALL THESE EXTRAORDINARY FURTHERERS OF MAN WHOM ONE CALLS PHILOSOPHERS, THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES HAVE RARELY FELT LIKE FRIENDS OF WISDOM BUT RATHER LIKE DISAGREEABLE FOOLS AND DANGEROUS QUESTION MARKS, HAVE FOUND THEIR TASK, THEIR HARD, UNWANTED, INESCAPABLE TASK, BUT EVENTUALLY ALSO THE GREATNESS OF THEIR TASK, IN BEING THE BAD CONSCIENCE OF THEIR TIME.

BY APPLYING THE KNIFE VIVISECTIONALLY TO THE CHEST OF THE VERY VIRTUES OF THEIR TIME, THEY BETRAYED WHAT WAS THEIR OWN SECRET: TO KNOW OF A NEW GREATNESS OF MAN, OF A NEW UNTRODDEN WAY TO HIS ENHANCEMENT. EVERY TIME THEY EXPOSED HOW MUCH HYPOCRISY, COMFORTABLENESS, LETTING ONESELF GO AND LETTING ONESELF DROP, HOW MANY LIES LAY HIDDEN UNDER THE BEST HONORED TYPE OF THEIR CONTEMPORARY MORALITY, HOW MUCH VIRTUE WAS OUTLIVED. EVERY TIME THEY SAID: ‚ÄÚWE MUST GET THERE, THAT WAY, WHERE YOU TODAY ARE LEAST AT HOME.‚ÄÙ

FACING A WORLD OF ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS‚ÄÙ THAT WOULD BANISH EVERYBODY INTO A CORNER AND ‚ÄÚSPECIALTY,‚ÄÙ A PHILOSOPHER‚ÄÎIF TODAY THERE COULD BE PHILOSOPHERS‚ÄÎWOULD BE COMPELLED TO FIND THE GREATNESS OF MAN, THE CONCEPT OF ‚ÄÚGREATNESS,‚ÄÙ PRECISELY IN HIS RANGE AND MULTIPLICITY, IN HIS WHOLENESS IN MANIFOLDNESS. HE WOULD EVEN DETERMINE VALUE AND RANK IN ACCORDANCE WITH HOW MUCH AND HOW MANY THINGS ONE COULD BEAR AND TAKE UPON HIMSELF, HOW FAR ONE COULD EXTEND HIS RESPONSIBILITY.

TODAY THE TASTE OF THE TIME AND THE VIRTUE OF THE TIME WEAKENS AND THINS DOWN THE WILL; NOTHING IS AS TIMELY AS WEAKNESS OF THE WILL. IN THE PHILOSOPHER‚ÄÔS IDEAL, THEREFORE, PRECISELY STRENGTH OF THE WILL, HARDNESS, AND THE CAPACITY FOR LONG-RANGE DECISIONS MUST BELONG TO THE CONCEPT OF ‚ÄÚGREATNESS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWITH AS MUCH JUSTIFICATION AS THE OPPOSITE DOCTRINE AND THE IDEAL OF A DUMB, RENUNCIATORY, HUMBLE, SELFLESS HUMANITY WAS SUITABLE FOR AN OPPOSITE AGE, ONE THAT SUFFERED, LIKE THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY, FROM ITS ACCUMULATED ENERGY OF WILL AND FROM THE MOST SAVAGE FLOODS AND TIDAL WAVES OF SELFISHNESS.

IN THE AGE OF SOCRATES, AMONG MEN OF FATIGUED INSTINCTS, AMONG THE CONSERVATIVES OF ANCIENT ATHENS WHO LET THEMSELVES GO‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚTOWARD HAPPINESS,‚ÄÙ AS THEY SAID; TOWARD PLEASURE, AS THEY ACTED‚ÄÎAND WHO ALL THE WHILE STILL MOUTHED THE ANCIENT POMPOUS WORDS TO WHICH THEIR LIVES NO LONGER GAVE THEM ANY RIGHT, IRONY MAY HAVE BEEN REQUIRED FOR GREATNESS OF SOUL,35 THAT SOCRATIC SARCASTIC ASSURANCE OF THE OLD PHYSICIAN AND PLEBEIAN WHO CUT RUTHLESSLY INTO HIS OWN FLESH, AS HE DID INTO THE FLESH AND HEART OF THE ‚ÄÚNOBLE,‚ÄÙ WITH A LOOK THAT SAID CLEARLY ENOUGH: ‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT DISSEMBLE IN FRONT OF ME! HERE‚ÄÎWE ARE EQUAL.‚ÄÙ

TODAY, CONVERSELY, WHEN ONLY THE HERD ANIMAL RECEIVES AND DISPENSES HONORS IN EUROPE, WHEN ‚ÄÚEQUALITY OF RIGHTS‚ÄÙ COULD ALL TOO EASILY BE CHANGED INTO EQUALITY IN VIOLATING RIGHTS‚ÄÎI MEAN, INTO A COMMON WAR ON ALL THAT IS RARE, STRANGE, PRIVILEGED, THE HIGHER MAN, THE HIGHER SOUL, THE HIGHER DUTY, THE HIGHER RESPONSIBILITY, AND THE ABUNDANCE OF CREATIVE POWER AND MASTERFULNESS‚ÄÎTODAY THE CONCEPT OF GREATNESS ENTAILS BEING NOBLE, WANTING TO BE BY ONESELF, BEING ABLE TO BE DIFFERENT, STANDING ALONE AND HAVING TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY. AND THE PHILOSOPHER WILL BETRAY SOMETHING OF HIS OWN IDEAL WHEN HE POSITS: ‚ÄÚHE SHALL BE GREATEST WHO CAN BE LONELIEST, THE MOST CONCEALED, THE MOST DEVIANT, THE HUMAN BEING BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, THE MASTER OF HIS VIRTUES, HE THAT IS OVERRICH IN WILL. PRECISELY THIS SHALL BE CALLED GREATNESS: BEING CAPABLE OF BEING AS MANIFOLD AS WHOLE, AS AMPLE AS FULL.‚ÄÙ AND TO ASK IT ONCE MORE: TODAY‚ÄÎIS GREATNESS POSSIBLE?

WHAT A PHILOSOPHER IS, THAT IS HARD TO LEARN BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE TAUGHT: ONE MUST ‚ÄÚKNOW‚ÄÙ IT, FROM EXPERIENCE‚ÄÎOR ONE SHOULD HAVE THE PRIDE NOT TO KNOW IT. BUT NOWADAYS ALL THE WORLD TALKS OF THINGS OF WHICH IT CANNOT HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE, AND THIS IS MOST TRUE, AND IN THE WORST WAY, CONCERNING PHILOSOPHERS AND PHILOSOPHICAL STATES: EXCEEDINGLY FEW KNOW THEM, MAY KNOW THEM, AND ALL POPULAR OPINIONS ABOUT THEM ARE FALSE.

THAT GENUINELY PHILOSOPHICAL COMBINATION, FOR EXAMPLE, OF A BOLD AND EXUBERANT SPIRITUALITY THAT RUNS PRESTO AND A DIALECTICAL SEVERITY AND NECESSITY THAT TAKES NO FALSE STEP IS UNKNOWN TO MOST THINKERS AND SCHOLARS FROM THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE, AND THEREFORE WOULD SEEM INCREDIBLE TO THEM IF SOMEBODY SHOULD SPEAK OF IT IN THEIR PRESENCE. THEY PICTURE EVERY NECESSITY AS A KIND OF NEED, AS A PAINSTAKING HAVING-TO-FOLLOW AND BEING-COMPELLED. AND THINKING ITSELF THEY CONSIDER SOMETHING SLOW AND HESITANT, ALMOST AS TOIL, AND OFTEN ENOUGH AS ‚ÄÚWORTHY OF THE SWEAT OF THE NOBLE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎBUT NOT IN THE LEAST AS SOMETHING LIGHT, DIVINE, CLOSELY RELATED TO DANCING AND HIGH SPIRITS. ‚ÄÚTHINKING‚ÄÙ AND TAKING A MATTER ‚ÄÚSERIOUSLY,‚ÄÙ CONSIDERING IT ‚ÄÚGRAVE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎFOR THEM ALL THIS BELONGS TOGETHER: THAT IS THE ONLY WAY THEY HAVE ‚ÄÚEXPERIENCED‚ÄÙ IT.

ARTISTS SEEM TO HAVE MORE SENSITIVE NOSES IN THESE MATTERS, KNOWING ONLY TOO WELL THAT PRECISELY WHEN THEY NO LONGER DO ANYTHING ‚ÄÚVOLUNTARILY‚ÄÙ BUT DO EVERYTHING OF NECESSITY, THEIR FEELING OF FREEDOM, SUBTLETY, FULL POWER, OF CREATIVE PLACING, DISPOSING, AND FORMING REACHES ITS PEAK‚ÄÎIN SHORT, THAT NECESSITY AND ‚ÄÚFREEDOM OF THE WILL‚ÄÙ THEN BECOME ONE IN THEM.

ULTIMATELY, THERE IS AN ORDER OF RANK AMONG STATES OF THE SOUL, AND THE ORDER OF RANK OF PROBLEMS ACCORDS WITH THIS. THE HIGHEST PROBLEMS REPULSE EVERYONE MERCILESSLY WHO DARES APPROACH THEM WITHOUT BEING PREDESTINED FOR THEIR SOLUTION BY THE HEIGHT AND POWER OF HIS SPIRITUALITY. WHAT DOES IT AVAIL WHEN NIMBLE SMARTIES OR CLUMSY SOLID MECHANICS AND EMPIRICISTS PUSH NEAR THEM, AS IS COMMON TODAY, TRYING WITH THEIR PLEBEIAN AMBITION TO ENTER THE ‚ÄÚCOURT OF COURTS.‚ÄÙ UPON SUCH CARPETS COARSE FEET MAY NEVER STEP: THE PRIMEVAL LAW OF THINGS TAKES CARE OF THAT; THE DOORS REMAIN CLOSED TO SUCH OBTRUSIVENESS, EVEN IF THEY CRASH AND CRUSH THEIR HEADS AGAINST THEM.

FOR EVERY HIGH WORLD ONE MUST BE BORN; OR TO SPEAK MORE CLEARLY, ONE MUST BE CULTIVATED FOR IT: A RIGHT TO PHILOSOPHY‚ÄÎTAKING THAT WORD IN ITS GREAT SENSE‚ÄÎONE HAS ONLY BY VIRTUE OF ONE‚ÄÔS ORIGINS; ONE‚ÄÔS ANCESTORS, ONE‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚBLOOD‚ÄÙ36 DECIDE HERE, TOO. MANY GENERATIONS MUST HAVE LABORED TO PREPARE THE ORIGIN OF THE PHILOSOPHER; EVERY ONE OF HIS VIRTUES MUST HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED, NURTURED, INHERITED, AND DIGESTED SINGLY, AND NOT ONLY THE BOLD, LIGHT, DELICATE GAIT AND COURSE OF HIS THOUGHTS BUT ABOVE ALL THE READINESS FOR GREAT RESPONSIBILITIES, THE LOFTINESS OF GLANCES THAT DOMINATE AND LOOK DOWN, FEELING SEPARATED FROM THE CROWD AND ITS DUTIES AND VIRTUES, THE AFFABLE PROTECTION AND DEFENSE OF WHATEVER IS MISUNDERSTOOD AND SLANDERED, WHETHER IT BE GOD OR DEVIL, THE PLEASURE AND EXERCISE OF THE GREAT JUSTICE, THE ART OF COMMAND, THE WIDTH OF THE WILL, THE SLOW EYE THAT RARELY ADMIRES, RARELY LOOKS UP, RARELY LOVES37‚ÄÎ

NIETZSCHE HAD ARGUED IN ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT PASSAGES OF HIS FIRST BOOK, THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY, THAT HAMLET IS NO SKEPTIC: ‚ÄÚACTION REQUIRES THE VEILS OF ILLUSION: THAT IS THE DOCTRINE OF HAMLET, NOT THAT CHEAP WISDOM OF JACK THE DREAMER WHO REFLECTS TOO MUCH ‚Ä¶ NOT REFLECTION, NO‚ÄÎTRUE KNOWLEDGE, AN INSIGHT INTO THE HORRIBLE TRUTH, OUTWEIGHS ANY MOTIVE FOR ACTION‚ÄÙ (SECTION 7).

27IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING NIETZSCHE TO REALIZE THAT HE IS NOT ‚ÄÚFOR‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚAGAINST‚ÄÙ SKEPTICISM, BUT THAT HE ANALYZES ONE TYPE OF SKEPTICISM WITH DISDAIN (SECTION 208) BEFORE DESCRIBING ANOTHER WITH WHICH HE CLEARLY IDENTIFIES HIMSELF. IT IS EQUALLY CHARACTERISTIC THAT WHEN HE JOINS HIS COUNTRYMEN IN ADMIRATION OF FREDERICK THE GREAT, HE PAYS TRIBUTE TO HIM NOT FOR HIS EXPLOITS AND CONQUESTS BUT RATHER FOR HIS SKEPTICISM, AND THAT HIS PRAISE OF ‚ÄÚTOUGH VIRILITY‚ÄÙ IS AIMED AT THE SUBLIMATED, SPIRITUAL VERSION FOUND, FOR EXAMPLE, IN PHILOLOGISTS AND HISTORIANS.

34THE DICHOTOMY PROPOSED IN THIS SECTION IS HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE: WE FIND BOTH ANALYSES AND NORMATIVE SUGGESTIONS IN THE WORKS OF THE MAJOR MORAL PHILOSOPHERS FROM PLATO AND ARISTOTLE TO SPINOZA AND KANT; AND NORMATIVE THINKERS OR LEGISLATORS WHO ARE NOT ALSO ANALYSTS ARE NOT PHILOSOPHERS. YET NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS POINT THAT SOMETHING VITAL IS LACKING IN THE WORK OF THOSE WHO ARE MERELY ‚ÄÚLABORERS‚ÄÙ IS CERTAINLY WORTH PONDERING, AND THE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING SECTION OFFERS A FAR SUPERIOR SUGGESTION ABOUT THE ETHOS OF THE ‚ÄÚTRUE‚ÄÙ PHILOSOPHER.

35ARISTOTLE‚ÄÔS DISCUSSION OF GREATNESS OF SOUL (MEGALOPSYCHIA) IS WORTH QUOTING HERE, AT LEAST IN PART, BECAUSE IT EVIDENTLY INFLUENCED NIETZSCHE. THE VALUATIONS THAT FIND EXPRESSION IN ARISTOTLE‚ÄÔS ACCOUNT ARE EXCEEDINGLY REMOTE FROM THOSE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT AND HELP US UNDERSTAND NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CONTRAST OF MASTER MORALITY AND SLAVE MORALITY, INTRODUCED BELOW (SECTION 260). MOREOVER, IN HIS LONG DISCUSSION OF ‚ÄÚWHAT IS NOBLE,‚ÄÙ NIETZSCHE EMULATES ARISTOTLE‚ÄÔS DESCRIPTIVE MODE.

‚ÄÚA PERSON IS THOUGHT TO BE GREAT-SOULED IF HE CLAIMS MUCH AND DESERVES MUCH [AS SOCRATES DID IN THE APOLOGY WHEN HE SAID HE DESERVED THE GREATEST HONOR ATHENS COULD BESTOW]‚Ä¶. HE THAT CLAIMS LESS THAN HE DESERVES IS SMALL-SOULED‚Ä¶. THE GREAT-SOULED MAN IS JUSTIFIED IN DESPISING OTHER PEOPLE‚ÄÎHIS ESTIMATES ARE CORRECT; BUT MOST PROUD MEN HAVE NO GOOD GROUND FOR THEIR PRIDE‚Ä¶. HE IS FOND OF CONFERRING BENEFITS, BUT ASHAMED TO RECEIVE THEM, BECAUSE THE FORMER IS A MARK OF SUPERIORITY AND THE LATTER OF INFERIORITY‚Ä¶. IT IS ALSO CHARACTERISTIC OF THE GREAT-SOULED MEN NEVER TO ASK HELP FROM OTHERS, OR ONLY WITH RELUCTANCE, BUT TO RENDER AID WILLINGLY; AND TO BE HAUGHTY TOWARDS MEN OF POSITION AND FORTUNE, BUT COURTEOUS TOWARDS THOSE OF MODERATE STATION‚Ä¶. HE MUST BE OPEN BOTH IN LOVE AND IN HATE, SINCE CONCEALMENT SHOWS TIMIDITY; AND CARE MORE FOR THE TRUTH THAN FOR WHAT PEOPLE WILL THINK; ‚Ä¶ HE IS OUTSPOKEN AND FRANK, EXCEPT WHEN SPEAKING WITH IRONICAL SELF-DEPRECIATION, AS HE DOES TO COMMON PEOPLE‚Ä¶. HE DOES NOT BEAR A GRUDGE, FOR IT IS NOT A MARK OF GREATNESS OF SOUL TO RECALL THINGS AGAINST PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY THE WRONGS THEY HAVE DONE YOU, BUT RATHER TO OVERLOOK THEM. HE IS ‚Ä¶ NOT GIVEN TO SPEAKING EVIL HIMSELF, EVEN OF HIS ENEMIES, EXCEPT WHEN HE DELIBERATELY INTENDS TO GIVE OFFENCE‚Ä¶. SUCH THEN BEING THE GREAT-SOULED MAN, THE CORRESPONDING CHARACTER ON THE SIDE OF DEFICIENCY IS THE SMALL-SOULED MAN, AND ON THAT OF EXCESS THE VAIN MAN‚ÄÙ (NICOMACHEAN ETHICS IV.3, RACKHAM TRANSLATION CAMBRIDGE, MASS., HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS, 1947).

THE WHOLE PASSAGE IS RELEVANT AND EXTREMELY INTERESTING.

36‚ÄÚGEBI√ºT.‚ÄÙ NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CONCEPTION OF ‚ÄÚBLOOD‚ÄÙ IS DISCUSSED, AND OTHER RELEVANT PASSAGES ARE QUOTED, IN KAUFMANN‚ÄÔS NIETZSCHE, AT THE END OF CHAPTER 10.

37THE ELEMENT OF SNOBBERY AND THE INFATUATION WITH ‚ÄÚDOMINATING‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚLOOKING DOWN‚ÄÙ ARE PERHAPS MORE OBVIOUS THAN NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS PERPETUAL SUBLIMATION AND SPIRITUALIZATION OF THESE AND OTHER SIMILAR QUALITIES. IT MAY BE INTERESTING TO COMPARE NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS VIEW WITH DR. THOMAS STOCKMANN IN ACT IV OF IBSEN‚ÄÔS AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE:

‚ÄÚWHAT A DIFFERENCE THERE IS BETWEEN A CULTIVATED AND AN UNCULTIVATED ANIMAL FAMILY! JUST LOOK AT A COMMON BARNYARD HEN‚Ä¶. BUT NOW TAKE A CULTIVATED SPANISH OR JAPANESE HEN, OR TAKE A NOBLE PHEASANT OR A TURKEY; INDEED, YOU‚ÄÔLL SEE THE DIFFERENCE. AND THEN I REFER YOU TO DOGS, WHICH ARE SO AMAZINGLY CLOSELY RELATED TO US MEN. CONSIDER FIRST A COMMON PLEBEIAN DOG‚ÄÎI MEAN, A DISGUSTING, SHAGGY, MOBLIKE CUR THAT MERELY RUNS DOWN THE STREETS AND FOULS THE HOUSES. AND THEN COMPARE THE CUR WITH A POODLE THAT FOR SEVERAL GENERATIONS IS DESCENDED FROM A NOBLE HOUSE WHERE IT RECEIVED GOOD FOOD AND HAS HAD OCCASION TO HEAR HARMONIOUS VOICES AND MUSIC. DON‚ÄÔT YOU SUPPOSE THAT THE POODLE‚ÄÔS BRAIN HAS DEVELOPED IN A WAY QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE CUR‚ÄÔS? YOU CAN COUNT ON IT. IT IS SUCH CULTIVATED YOUNG POODLES THAT JUGGLERS CAN TRAIN TO DO THE MOST ASTONISHING TRICKS. A COMMON PEASANT CUR COULD NEVER LEARN ANYTHING OF THE KIND, EVEN IF STOOD ON ITS HEAD.‚ÄÙ

NOT ONLY DO NIETZSCHE AND IBSEN‚ÄÔS DR. STOCKMANN SHARE LAMARCK‚ÄÔS BELIEF IN THE HEREDITY OF ACQUIRED CHARACTERISTICS; BOTH ARE CONCERNED WITH SPIRITUAL NOBILITY AND REALIZE THAT‚ÄÎTO PUT IT PLAINLY‚ÄÎOF TWO BROTHERS ONE MAY HAVE IT AND THE OTHER NOT. THUS STOCKMANN SAYS.A LITTLE LATER: ‚ÄÚBUT THAT‚ÄÔS HOW IT ALWAYS GOES WHEN PLEBEIAN DESCENT IS STILL IN ONE‚ÄÔS LIMBS AND ONE HAS NOT WORKED ONE‚ÄÔS WAY UP TO SPIRITUAL NOBILITY‚Ä¶. THAT KIND OF RABBLE OF WHICH I AM SPEAKING ISN‚ÄÔT TO BE FOUND ONLY IN THE LOWER STRATA‚Ä¶. MY BROTHER PETER‚ÄÎHE IS ALSO A PLEBEIAN STRAIGHT OUT OF THE BOOK.‚ÄÙ

OUR VIRTUES?‚ÄÎIT IS PROBABLE THAT WE, TOO, STILL HAVE OUR VIRTUES, ALTHOUGH IN ALL FAIRNESS THEY WILL NOT BE THE SIMPLEMINDED AND FOURSQUARE VIRTUES FOR WHICH WE HOLD OUR GRANDFATHERS IN HONOR‚ÄÎAND AT ARM‚ÄÔS LENGTH. WE EUROPEANS OF THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, WE FIRSTBORN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY‚ÄÎWITH ALL OUR DANGEROUS CURIOSITY, OUR MULTIPLICITY AND ART OF DISGUISES, OUR MELLOW AND, AS IT WERE, SWEETENED CRUELTY IN SPIRIT AND SENSES‚ÄÎIF WE SHOULD HAVE VIRTUES WE SHALL PRESUMABLY HAVE ONLY VIRTUES WHICH HAVE LEARNED TO GET ALONG BEST WITH OUR MOST SECRET AND CORDIAL INCLINATIONS, WITH OUR MOST ARDENT NEEDS. WELL THEN, LET US LOOK FOR THEM IN OUR LABYRINTHS‚ÄÎWHERE, AS IS WELL KNOWN, ALL SORTS OF THINGS LOSE THEMSELVES, ALL SORTS OF THINGS ARE LOST FOR GOOD. AND IS THERE ANYTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN LOOKING FOR ONE‚ÄÔS OWN VIRTUES? DOESN‚ÄÔT THIS ALMOST MEAN: BELIEVING IN ONE‚ÄÔS OWN VIRTUE? BUT THIS ‚ÄÚBELIEVING IN ONE‚ÄÔS VIRTUE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎISN‚ÄÔT THIS AT BOTTOM THE SAME THING THAT WAS FORMERLY CALLED ONE‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚGOOD CONSCIENCE,‚ÄÙ THAT VENERABLE LONG PIGTAIL OF A CONCEPT WHICH OUR GRANDFATHERS FASTENED TO THE BACKS OF THEIR HEADS, AND OFTEN ENOUGH ALSO TO THE BACKSIDE OF THEIR UNDERSTANDING? SO IT SEEMS THAT HOWEVER LITTLE WE MAY SEEM OLD-FASHIONED AND GRANDFATHERLY-HONORABLE TO OURSELVES IN OTHER MATTERS, IN ONE RESPECT WE ARE NEVERTHELESS THE WORTHY GRANDSONS OF THESE GRANDFATHERS, WE LAST EUROPEANS WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE: WE, TOO, STILL WEAR THEIR PIGTAIL.‚ÄÎALAS, IF YOU KNEW HOW SOON, VERY SOON‚ÄÎALL WILL BE DIFFERENT!‚ÄÎ

AS IN THE REALM OF STARS THE ORBIT OF A PLANET IS IN SOME CASES DETERMINED BY TWO SUNS; AS IN CERTAIN CASES SUNS OF DIFFERENT COLORS SHINE NEAR A SINGLE PLANET, SOMETIMES WITH RED LIGHT, SOMETIMES WITH GREEN LIGHT, AND THEN OCCASIONALLY ILLUMINATING THE PLANET AT THE SAME TIME AND FLOODING IT WITH COLORS‚ÄÎSO WE MODERN MEN ARE DETERMINED, THANKS TO THE COMPLICATED MECHANICS OF OUR ‚ÄÚSTARRY SKY,‚ÄÙ BY DIFFERENT MORALITIES; OUR ACTIONS SHINE ALTERNATELY IN DIFFERENT COLORS, THEY ARE RARELY UNIVOCAL‚ÄÎAND THERE ARE CASES ENOUGH IN WHICH WE PERFORM ACTIONS OF MANY COLORS.

LOVE ONE‚ÄÔS ENEMIES? I THINK THIS HAS BEEN LEARNED WELL: IT IS DONE THOUSANDS OF TIMES TODAY, IN SMALL WAYS AND BIG WAYS. INDEED, AT TIMES SOMETHING HIGHER AND MORE SUBLIME IS DONE: WE LEARN TO DESPISE WHEN WE LOVE, AND PRECISELY WHEN WE LOVE BEST‚ÄÎBUT ALL OF THIS UNCONSCIOUSLY, WITHOUT NOISE, WITHOUT POMP, WITH THAT MODESTY AND CONCEALED GOODNESS WHICH FORBIDS THE MOUTH SOLEMN WORDS AND VIRTUE FORMULAS. MORALITY AS A POSE‚ÄÎOFFENDS OUR TASTE TODAY. THAT, TOO, IS PROGRESS‚ÄÎJUST AS IT WAS PROGRESS WHEN RELIGION AS A POSE FINALLY OFFENDED OUR FATHERS‚ÄÔ TASTE, INCLUDING HOSTILITY AND VOLTAIRIAN BITTERNESS AGAINST RELIGION (AND EVERYTHING THAT FORMERLY BELONGED TO THE GESTURES OF FREE-THINKERS). IT IS THE MUSIC IN OUR CONSCIENCE, THE DANCE IN OUR SPIRIT, WITH WHICH THE SOUND OF ALL PURITAN LITANIES, ALL MORAL HOMILIES AND OLD-FASHIONED RESPECTABILITY WON‚ÄÔT GO.





217


BEWARE OF THOSE WHO ATTACH GREAT VALUE TO BEING CREDITED WITH MORAL TACT AND SUBTLETY IN MAKING MORAL DISTINCTIONS. THEY NEVER FORGIVE US ONCE THEY HAVE MADE A MISTAKE IN FRONT OF US (OR, WORSE, AGAINST US): INEVITABLY THEY BECOME OUR INSTINCTIVE SLANDERERS AND DETRACTORS, EVEN IF THEY SHOULD STILL REMAIN OUR ‚ÄÚFRIENDS.‚ÄÙ

BLESSED ARE THE FORGETFUL: FOR THEY GET OVER THEIR STUPIDITIES, TOO.

THE PSYCHOLOGISTS OF FRANCE‚ÄÎAND WHERE ELSE ARE ANY PSYCHOLOGISTS LEFT TODAY?‚ÄÎSTILL HAVE NOT EXHAUSTED THEIR BITTER AND MANIFOLD DELIGHT IN THE B√™TISE BOURGEOISE,1 JUST AS IF‚ÄÎENOUGH, THIS BETRAYS SOMETHING. FLAUBERT, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT SOLID CITIZEN OF ROUEN, IN THE END NO LONGER SAW, HEARD, OR TASTED ANYTHING ELSE ANY MORE: THIS WAS HIS KIND OF SELF-TORTURE AND SUBTLER CRUELTY. NOW, FOR A CHANGE‚ÄÎSINCE THIS IS BECOMING BORING‚ÄÎI PROPOSE ANOTHER SOURCE OF AMUSEMENT: THE UNCONSCIOUS CRAFTINESS WITH WHICH ALL GOOD, FAT, SOLID, MEDIOCRE SPIRITS REACT TO HIGHER SPIRITS AND THEIR TASKS‚ÄÎTHAT SUBTLE, INVOLVED, JESUITICAL CRAFTINESS WHICH IS A THOUSAND TIMES MORE SUBTLE THAN NOT ONLY THE UNDERSTANDING AND TASTE OF THIS MIDDLE CLASS IS AT ITS BEST MOMENTS, BUT EVEN THE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS VICTIMS‚ÄÎWHICH PROVES ONCE AGAIN THAT ‚ÄÚINSTINCT‚ÄÙ IS OF ALL THE KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE THAT HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED SO FAR‚ÄÎTHE MOST INTELLIGENT. IN SHORT, MY DEAR PSYCHOLOGISTS, STUDY THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE ‚ÄÚNORM‚ÄÙ IN ITS FIGHT AGAINST THE ‚ÄÚEXCEPTION‚ÄÙ: THERE‚ÄÎYOU HAVE A SPECTACLE THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR GODS AND GODLIKE MALICE! OR, STILL MORE CLEARLY: VIVISECT THE ‚ÄÚGOOD MAN,‚ÄÙ THE ‚ÄÚHOMO BONAE VOLUNTATIS‚ÄÙ2‚ÄÎYOURSELVES!

MORAL JUDGMENTS AND CONDEMNATIONS CONSTITUTE THE FAVORITE REVENGE OF THE SPIRITUALLY LIMITED AGAINST THOSE LESS LIMITED‚ÄÎALSO A SORT OF COMPENSATION FOR HAVING BEEN ILL-FAVORED BY NATURE‚ÄÎFINALLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ACQUIRING SPIRIT AND BECOMING REFINED‚ÄÎMALICE SPIRITUALIZED. IT PLEASES THEM DEEP DOWN IN THEIR HEARTS THAT THERE ARE STANDARDS BEFORE WHICH THOSE OVERFLOWING WITH THE WEALTH AND PRIVILEGES OF THE SPIRIT ARE THEIR EQUALS: THEY FIGHT FOR THE ‚ÄÚEQUALITY OF ALL MEN BEFORE GOD‚ÄÙ AND ALMOST NEED FAITH IN GOD JUST FOR THAT. THEY INCLUDE THE MOST VIGOROUS FOES OF ATHEISM. ANYONE WHO SAID TO THEM, ‚ÄÚHIGH SPIRITUALITY IS INCOMPARABLE WITH ANY KIND OF SOLIDITY AND RESPECTABILITY OF A MERELY MORAL MAN‚ÄÙ WOULD ENRAGE THEM‚ÄÎAND I SHALL BEWARE OF DOING THIS. RATHER I WANT TO FLATTER THEM WITH MY PROPOSITION, THAT HIGH SPIRITUALITY ITSELF EXISTS ONLY AS THE ULTIMATE PRODUCT OF MORAL QUALITIES; THAT IT IS A SYNTHESIS OF ALL THOSE STATES WHICH ARE ATTRIBUTED TO ‚ÄÚMERELY MORAL‚ÄÙ MEN, AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED SINGLY THROUGH LONG DISCIPLINE AND EXERCISE, PERHAPS THROUGH WHOLE CHAINS OF GENERATIONS; THAT HIGH SPIRITUALITY IS THE SPIRITUALIZATION OF JUSTICE AND OF THAT GRACIOUS SEVERITY WHICH KNOWS THAT IT IS ITS MISSION TO MAINTAIN THE ORDER OF RANK IN THE WORLD, AMONG THINGS THEMSELVES‚ÄÎAND NOT ONLY AMONG MEN.

IN VIEW OF THE MODERN POPULARITY OF PRAISE OF THE ‚ÄÚDISINTERESTED,‚ÄÙ WE SHOULD BRING TO CONSCIOUSNESS, PERHAPS NOT WITHOUT SOME DANGER, WHAT IT IS THAT ELICITS THE PEOPLE‚ÄÔS INTEREST, AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS ABOUT WHICH THE COMMON MAN IS DEEPLY AND PROFOUNDLY CONCERNED‚ÄÎINCLUDING THE EDUCATED, EVEN THE SCHOLARS, AND UNLESS ALL APPEARANCES DECEIVE, PERHAPS EVEN THE PHILOSOPHERS. THEN THE FACT EMERGES THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE THINGS THAT INTEREST AND ATTRACT CHOOSIER AND MORE REFINED TASTES AND EVERY HIGHER NATURE SEEM TO THE AVERAGE MAN TOTALLY ‚ÄÚUNINTERESTING;‚ÄÙ AND WHEN HE NEVERTHELESS NOTICES A DEVOTION TO SUCH MATTERS HE CALLS IT ‚ÄÚD√©SINT√©RESS√©‚ÄÙ AND WONDERS HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACT ‚ÄÚWITHOUT INTEREST.‚ÄÙ THERE HAVE BEEN PHILOSOPHERS WHO HAVE KNOWN HOW TO LEND TO THIS POPULAR WONDER A SEDUCTIVE AND MYSTICAL-TRANSCENDENTAL EXPRESSION3(‚ÄÎPERHAPS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW THE HIGHER NATURE FROM EXPERIENCE?)‚ÄÎINSTEAD OF POSITING THE NAKED TRUTH, WHICH IS SURELY NOT HARD TO COME BY, THAT THE ‚ÄÚDISINTERESTED‚ÄÙ ACTION IS AN EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING AND INTERESTED ACTION, ASSUMING‚ÄÎ

‚ÄÚAND LOVE?‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWHAT? EVEN AN ACTION DONE FROM LOVE IS SUPPOSED TO BE ‚ÄÚUNEGOISTIC‚ÄÙ? BUT YOU DOLTS! ‚ÄÚAND THE PRAISE OF SACRIFICES?‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎBUT ANYONE WHO HAS REALLY MADE SACRIFICES KNOWS THAT HE WANTED AND GOT SOMETHING IN RETURN‚ÄÎPERHAPS SOMETHING OF HIMSELF IN RETURN FOR SOMETHING OF HIMSELF‚ÄÎTHAT HE GAVE UP HERE IN ORDER TO HAVE MORE THERE, PERHAPS IN ORDER TO BE MORE OR AT LEAST TO FEEL THAT HE WAS ‚ÄÚMORE.‚ÄÙ BUT THIS A REALM OF QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS IN WHICH A CHOOSIER SPIRIT DOES NOT LIKE TO DWELL: EVEN NOW TRUTH FINDS IT NECESSARY TO STIFLE HER YAWNS WHEN SHE IS EXPECTED TO GIVE ANSWERS. IN THE END SHE IS A WOMAN: SHE SHOULD NOT BE VIOLATED.





221


IT DOES HAPPEN, SAID A MORALISTIC PEDANT AND DEALER IN TRIFLES, THAT I HONOR AND EXALT A MAN FREE OF SELF-INTEREST‚ÄÎNOT BECAUSE HE IS FREE OF SELF-INTEREST BUT BECAUSE HE SEEMS TO ME TO BE ENTITLED TO PROFIT ANOTHER HUMAN BEING AT HIS OWN EXPENSE. ENOUGH; THE QUESTION IS ALWAYS WHO HE IS, AND WHO THE OTHER PERSON IS. IN A PERSON, FOR EXAMPLE, WHO IS CALLED AND MADE TO COMMAND, SELF-DENIAL AND MODEST SELF-EFFACEMENT WOULD NOT BE A VIRTUE BUT THE WASTE OF A VIRTUE: THUS IT SEEMS TO ME. EVERY UNEGOISTIC MORALITY THAT TAKES ITSELF FOR UNCONDITIONAL AND ADDRESSES ITSELF TO ALL DOES NOT ONLY SIN AGAINST TASTE: IT IS A PROVOCATION TO SINS OF OMISSION, ONE MORE SEDUCTION UNDER THE MASK OF PHILANTHROPY‚ÄÎAND PRECISELY A SEDUCTION AND INJURY FOR THE HIGHER, RARER, PRIVILEGED. MORALITIES MUST BE FORCED TO BOW FIRST OF ALL BEFORE THE ORDER OF RANK; THEIR PRESUMPTION MUST BE BROUGHT HOME TO THEIR CONSCIENCE‚ÄÎUNTIL THEY FINALLY REACH AGREEMENT THAT IT IS IMMORAL TO SAY: ‚ÄÚWHAT IS RIGHT FOR ONE IS FAIR FOR THE OTHER.‚ÄÙ

THUS MY MORALISTIC PEDANT AND BONHOMME:4 DOES HE DESERVE TO BE LAUGHED AT FOR THUS ADMONISHING MORALITIES TO BECOME MORAL? BUT ONE SHOULD NOT BE TOO RIGHT IF ONE WANTS TO HAVE THOSE WHO LAUGH ON ONE‚ÄÔS OWN SIDE; A GRAIN OF WRONG ACTUALLY BELONGS TO GOOD TASTE.

WHERE PITY IS PREACHED TODAY‚ÄÎAND, IF YOU LISTEN CLOSELY, THIS IS THE ONLY RELIGION PREACHED NOW‚ÄÎPSYCHOLOGISTS SHOULD KEEP THEIR EARS OPEN: THROUGH ALL THE VANITY, THROUGH ALL THE NOISE THAT CHARACTERIZES THESE PREACHERS (LIKE ALL PREACHERS) THEY WILL HEAR A HOARSE, GROANING, GENUINE SOUND OF SELF-CONTEMPT. THIS BELONGS TO THAT DARKENING AND UGLIFICATION OF EUROPE WHICH HAS BEEN GROWING FOR A CENTURY NOW (AND WHOSE FIRST SYMPTOMS WERE REGISTERED IN A THOUGHTFUL LETTER GALIANI WROTE TO MADAME D‚ÄÔ√ÂPINAY)5‚ÄÎUNLESS IT IS THE CAUSE OF THIS PROCESS. THE MAN OF ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS,‚ÄÙ THIS PROUD APE, IS IMMEASURABLY DISSATISFIED WITH HIMSELF: THAT IS CERTAIN. HE SUFFERS‚ÄÎAND HIS VANITY WANTS HIM TO SUFFER ONLY WITH OTHERS, TO FEEL PITY.‚ÄÎ

THE HYBRID EUROPEAN‚ÄÎALL IN ALL, A TOLERABLY UGLY PLEBEIAN‚ÄÎSIMPLY NEEDS A COSTUME: HE REQUIRES HISTORY AS A STORAGE ROOM FOR COSTUMES. TO BE SURE, HE SOON NOTICES THAT NOT ONE FITS HIM VERY WELL; SO HE KEEPS CHANGING. LET ANYONE LOOK AT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WITH AN EYE FOR THESE QUICK PREFERENCES AND CHANGES OF THE STYLE MASQUERADE; ALSO FOR THE MOMENTS OF DESPAIR OVER THE FACT THAT ‚ÄÚNOTHING IS BECOMING.‚ÄÙ IT IS NO USE TO PARADE AS ROMANTIC OR CLASSICAL, CHRISTIAN OR FLORENTINE, BAROQUE OR ‚ÄÚNATIONAL,‚ÄÙ IN MORIBUS ET ARTIBUS: IT ‚ÄÚDOES NOT LOOK GOOD.‚ÄÙ BUT THE ‚ÄÚSPIRIT,‚ÄÙ ESPECIALLY THE ‚ÄÚHISTORICAL SPIRIT,‚ÄÙ FINDS ITS ADVANTAGE EVEN IN THIS DESPAIR: AGAIN AND AGAIN A NEW PIECE OF PREHISTORY OR A FOREIGN COUNTRY IS TRIED ON, PUT ON, TAKEN OFF, PACKED AWAY, AND ABOVE ALL STUDIED: WE ARE THE FIRST AGE THAT HAS TRULY STUDIED ‚ÄÚCOSTUMES‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎI MEAN THOSE OF MORALITIES, ARTICLES OF FAITH, TASTES IN THE ARTS, AND RELIGIONS‚ÄÎPREPARED LIKE NO PREVIOUS AGE FOR A CARNIVAL IN THE GRAND STYLE, FOR THE LAUGHTER AND HIGH SPIRITS OF THE MOST SPIRITUAL REVELRY, FOR THE TRANSCENDENTAL HEIGHTS OF THE HIGHEST NONSENSE AND ARISTOPHANEAN DERISION OF THE WORLD. PERHAPS THIS IS WHERE WE SHALL STILL DISCOVER THE REALM OF OUR INVENTION, THAT REALM IN WHICH WE, TOO, CAN STILL BE ORIGINAL, SAY, AS PARODISTS OF WORLD HISTORY AND GOD‚ÄÔS BUFFOONS‚ÄÎPERHAPS, EVEN IF NOTHING ELSE TODAY HAS ANY FUTURE, OUR LAUGHTER MAY YET HAVE A FUTURE.

THE HISTORICAL SENSE (OR THE CAPACITY FOR QUICKLY GUESSING THE ORDER OF RANK OF THE VALUATIONS ACCORDING TO WHICH A PEOPLE, A SOCIETY, A HUMAN BEING HAS LIVED; THE ‚ÄÚDIVINATORY INSTINCT‚ÄÙ FOR THE RELATIONS OF THESE VALUATIONS, FOR THE RELATION OF THE AUTHORITY OF VALUES TO THE AUTHORITY OF ACTIVE FORCES)‚ÄÎTHIS HISTORICAL SENSE TO WHICH WE EUROPEANS LAY CLAIM AS OUR SPECIALTY HAS COME TO US IN THE WAKE OF THAT ENCHANTING AND MAD SEMI-BARBARISM INTO WHICH EUROPE HAD BEEN PLUNGED BY THE DEMOCRATIC MINGLING OF CLASSES AND RACES: ONLY THE NINETEENTH CENTURY KNOWS THIS SENSE, AS ITS SIXTH SENSE. THE PAST OF EVERY FORM AND WAY OF LIFE, OF CULTURES THAT FORMERLY LAY RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER OR ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER, NOW FLOWS INTO US ‚ÄÚMODERN SOULS,‚ÄÙ THANKS TO THIS MIXTURE; OUR INSTINCTS NOW RUN BACK EVERYWHERE; WE OURSELVES ARE A KIND OF CHAOS. FINALLY, AS ALREADY MENTIONED, ‚ÄÚTHE SPIRIT‚ÄÙ SEES ITS ADVANTAGE IN THIS.

THROUGH OUR SEMI-BARBARISM IN BODY AND DESIRES WE HAVE SECRET ACCESS IN ALL DIRECTIONS, AS NO NOBLE AGE EVER DID; ABOVE ALL, ACCESS TO THE LABYRINTHS OF UNFINISHED CULTURES AND TO EVERY SEMI-BARBARISM THAT EVER EXISTED ON EARTH. AND INSOFAR AS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PART OF HUMAN CULTURE SO FAR WAS SEMI-BARBARISM, ‚ÄÚHISTORICAL SENSE‚ÄÙ ALMOST MEANS THE SENSE AND INSTINCT FOR EVERYTHING, THE TASTE AND TONGUE FOR EVERYTHING‚ÄÎWHICH IMMEDIATELY PROVES IT TO BE AN IGNOBLE SENSE. WE ENJOY HOMER AGAIN, FOR EXAMPLE: PERHAPS IT IS OUR MOST FORTUNATE ADVANTAGE THAT WE KNOW HOW TO RELISH HOMER WHOM THE MEN OF A NOBLE CULTURE (SAY, THE FRENCH OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY, LIKE SAINT-√ÂVREMOND, WHO REPROACHED HIM FOR HIS ESPRIT VASTE,6 AND EVEN THEIR AFTERGLOW, VOLTAIRE) CANNOT AND COULD NOT ASSIMILATE SO EASILY‚ÄÎWHOM TO ENJOY THEY SCARCELY PERMITTED THEMSELVES. THE VERY DEFINITE YES AND NO OF THEIR PALATE, THEIR EASY NAUSEA, THEIR HESITANT RESERVE TOWARD EVERYTHING FOREIGN, THEIR HORROR OF THE POOR TASTE EVEN OF A LIVELY CURIOSITY, AND ALTOGETHER THE RELUCTANCE OF EVERY NOBLE AND SELF-SUFFICIENT CULTURE TO OWN A NEW DESIRE, A DISSATISFACTION WITH WHAT IS ONE‚ÄÔS OWN, AND ADMIRATION FOR WHAT IS FOREIGN‚ÄÎALL THIS INCLINES AND DISPOSES THEM UNFAVORABLY EVEN AGAINST THE BEST THINGS IN THE WORLD WHICH ARE NOT THEIRS OR COULD NOT BECOME THEIR PREY. NO SENSE IS MORE INCOMPREHENSIBLE FOR SUCH PEOPLE THAN THE HISTORICAL SENSE AND ITS SUBMISSIVE PLEBEIAN CURIOSITY.

IT IS NO DIFFERENT WITH SHAKESPEARE, THAT AMAZING SPANISH-MOORISH-SAXON SYNTHESIS OF TASTES THAT WOULD HAVE ALL BUT KILLED AN ANCIENT ATHENIAN OF AESCHYLUS‚ÄÔ CIRCLE WITH LAUGHTER OR IRRITATION. BUT WE‚ÄÎACCEPT PRECISELY THIS WILD ABUNDANCE OF COLORS, THIS MEDLEY OF WHAT IS MOST DELICATE, COARSEST, AND MOST ARTIFICIAL, WITH A SECRET FAMILIARITY AND CORDIALITY; WE ENJOY HIM AS A SUPERB SUBTLETY OF ART SAVED UP ESPECIALLY FOR US; AND THE DISGUSTING ODORS AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE ENGLISH RABBLE IN WHICH SHAKESPEARE‚ÄÔS ART AND TASTE LIVE WE DO NOT ALLOW TO DISTURB US ANY MORE THAN ON THE CHIAJA OF NAPLES, WHERE WE GO OUR WAY WITH ALL OUR SENSES AWAKE, ENCHANTED AND WILLING, THOUGH THE SEWER SMELLS OF THE PLEBEIAN QUARTERS FILL THE AIR.

AS MEN OF THE ‚ÄÚHISTORICAL SENSE‚ÄÙ WE ALSO HAVE OUR VIRTUES; THAT CANNOT BE DENIED: WE ARE UNPRETENTIOUS, SELFLESS, MODEST, COURAGEOUS, FULL OF SELF-OVERCOMING, FULL OF DEVOTION, VERY GRATEFUL, VERY PATIENT, VERY ACCOMMODATING; BUT FOR ALL THAT WE ARE PERHAPS NOT PARAGONS OF GOOD TASTE. LET US FINALLY OWN IT TO OURSELVES: WHAT WE MEN OF THE ‚ÄÚHISTORICAL SENSE‚ÄÙ FIND MOST DIFFICULT TO GRASP, TO FEEL, TO TASTE ONCE MORE, TO LOVE ONCE MORE, WHAT AT BOTTOM FINDS US PREJUDICED AND ALMOST HOSTILE, IS PRECISELY THE PERFECTION AND ULTIMATE MATURITY OF EVERY CULTURE AND ART,7 THAT WHICH IS REALLY NOBLE IN A WORK OR HUMAN BEING, THE MOMENT WHEN THEIR SEA IS SMOOTH AND THEY HAVE FOUND HALCYON SELF-SUFFICIENCY, THE GOLDEN AND COLD ASPECT OF ALL THINGS THAT HAVE CONSUMMATED THEMSELVES.

PERHAPS OUR GREAT VIRTUE OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE IS NECESSARILY OPPOSED TO GOOD TASTE, AT LEAST TO THE VERY BEST TASTE; AND PRECISELY THE HIGHEST LITTLE STROKES OF LUCK AND TRANSFIGURATIONS OF HUMAN LIFE THAT BRIEFLY LIGHT UP HERE AND THERE WE CAN RECAPTURE ONLY POORLY, HESITANTLY, BY FORCING OURSELVES‚ÄÎTHOSE MOMENTS AND MARVELS WHEN GREAT POWER VOLUNTARILY STOPPED THIS SIDE OF THE IMMEASURABLE AND BOUNDLESS, WHEN AN EXCESS OF SUBTLE DELIGHT IN SUDDEN RESTRAINT AND PETRIFICATION, IN STANDING FIRM AND TAKING ONE‚ÄÔS MEASURE, WAS ENJOYED ON STILL TREMBLING GROUND. MEASURE IS ALIEN TO US; LET US OWN IT; OUR THRILL IS THE THRILL OF THE INFINITE, THE UNMEASURED. LIKE A RIDER ON A STEED THAT FLIES FORWARD, WE DROP THE REINS BEFORE THE INFINITE, WE MODERN MEN, LIKE SEMI-BARBARIANS‚ÄÎAND REACH OUR BLISS ONLY WHERE WE ARE MOST‚ÄÎIN DANGER.





225


WHETHER IT IS HEDONISM OR PESSIMISM, UTILITARIANISM OR EUDAEMONISM‚ÄÎALL THESE WAYS OF THINKING THAT MEASURE THE VALUE OF THINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH PLEASURE AND PAIN, WHICH ARE MERE EPIPHENOMENA AND WHOLLY SECONDARY, ARE WAYS OF THINKING THAT STAY IN THE FOREGROUND AND NA√ØVET√©S ON WHICH EVERYONE CONSCIOUS OF CREATIVE POWERS AND AN ARTISTIC CONSCIENCE WILL LOOK DOWN NOT WITHOUT DERISION, NOR WITHOUT PITY. PITY WITH YOU‚ÄÎTHAT, OF COURSE, IS NOT PITY IN YOUR SENSE: IT IS NOT PITY WITH SOCIAL ‚ÄÚDISTRESS,‚ÄÙ WITH ‚ÄÚSOCIETY‚ÄÙ AND ITS SICK AND UNFORTUNATE MEMBERS, WITH THOSE ADDICTED TO VICE AND MAIMED FROM THE START, THOUGH THE GROUND AROUND US IS LITTERED WITH THEM; IT IS EVEN LESS PITY WITH GRUMBLING, SORELY PRESSED, REBELLIOUS SLAVE STRATA WHO LONG FOR DOMINION, CALLING IT ‚ÄÚFREEDOM.‚ÄÙ OUR PITY IS A HIGHER AND MORE FARSIGHTED PITY: WE SEE HOW MAN MAKES HIMSELF SMALLER, HOW YOU MAKE HIM SMALLER‚ÄÎAND THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN WE BEHOLD YOUR VERY PITY WITH INDESCRIBABLE ANXIETY, WHEN WE RESIST THIS PITY‚ÄÎWHEN WE FIND YOUR SERIOUSNESS MORE DANGEROUS THAN ANY FRIVOLITY. YOU WANT, IF POSSIBLE‚ÄÎAND THERE IS NO MORE INSANE ‚ÄÚIF POSSIBLE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTO ABOLISH SUFFERING. AND WE? IT REALLY SEEMS THAT WE WOULD RATHER HAVE IT HIGHER AND WORSE THAN EVER. WELL-BEING AS YOU UNDERSTAND IT‚ÄÎTHAT IS NO GOAL, THAT SEEMS TO US AN END, A STATE THAT SOON MAKES MAN RIDICULOUS AND CONTEMPTIBLE‚ÄÎTHAT MAKES HIS DESTRUCTION8 DESIRABLE.

THE DISCIPLINE OF SUFFERING, OF GREAT SUFFERING‚ÄÎDO YOU NOT KNOW THAT ONLY THIS DISCIPLINE HAS CREATED ALL ENHANCEMENTS OF MAN SO FAR? THAT TENSION OF THE SOUL IN UNHAPPINESS WHICH CULTIVATES ITS STRENGTH, ITS SHUDDERS FACE TO FACE WITH GREAT RUIN, ITS INVENTIVENESS AND COURAGE IN ENDURING, PERSEVERING, INTERPRETING, AND EXPLOITING SUFFERING, AND WHATEVER HAS BEEN GRANTED TO IT OF PROFUNDITY, SECRET, MASK, SPIRIT, CUNNING, GREATNESS‚ÄÎWAS IT NOT GRANTED TO IT THROUGH SUFFERING, THROUGH THE DISCIPLINE OF GREAT SUFFERING? IN MAN CREATURE AND CREATOR ARE UNITED: IN MAN THERE IS MATERIAL, FRAGMENT, EXCESS, CLAY, DIRT, NONSENSE, CHAOS; BUT IN MAN THERE IS ALSO CREATOR, FORM-GIVER, HAMMER HARDNESS, SPECTATOR DIVINITY, AND SEVENTH DAY: DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS CONTRAST? AND THAT YOUR PITY IS FOR THE ‚ÄÚCREATURE IN MAN,‚ÄÙ FOR WHAT MUST BE FORMED, BROKEN, FORGED, TORN, BURNT, MADE INCANDESCENT, AND PURIFIED‚ÄÎTHAT WHICH NECESSARILY MUST AND SHOULD SUFFER? AND OUR PITY‚ÄÎDO YOU NOT COMPREHEND FOR WHOM OUR CONVERSE PITY IS WHEN IT RESISTS YOUR PITY AS THE WORST OF ALL PAMPERINGS AND WEAKNESSES?

THUS IT IS PITY VERSUS PITY.

BUT TO SAY IT ONCE MORE: THERE ARE HIGHER PROBLEMS THAN ALL PROBLEMS OF PLEASURE, PAIN, AND PITY; AND EVERY PHILOSOPHY THAT STOPS WITH THEM IS A NA√ØVET√©.‚ÄÎ





226


WE IMMORALISTS!‚ÄÎTHIS WORLD THAT CONCERNS US, IN WHICH WE FEAR AND LOVE, THIS ALMOST INVISIBLE AND INAUDIBLE WORLD OF SUBTLE COMMANDING AND SUBTLE OBEYING, IN EVERY WAY A WORLD OF THE ‚ÄÚALMOST,‚ÄÙ INVOLVED, CAPTIOUS, PEAKED, AND TENDER‚ÄÎINDEED, IT IS DEFENDED WELL AGAINST CLUMSY SPECTATORS AND FAMILIAR CURIOSITY. WE HAVE BEEN SPUN INTO A SEVERE YARN AND SHIRT OF DUTIES AND CANNOT GET OUT OF THAT‚ÄÎAND IN THIS WE ARE ‚ÄÚMEN OF DUTY,‚ÄÙ WE, TOO. OCCASIONALLY, THAT IS TRUE, WE DANCE IN OUR ‚ÄÚCHAINS‚ÄÙ AND BETWEEN OUR ‚ÄÚSWORDS;‚ÄÙ MORE OFTEN, THAT IS NO LESS TRUE, WE GNASH OUR TEETH AND FEEL IMPATIENT WITH ALL THE SECRET HARDNESS OF OUR DESTINY. BUT WE CAN DO WHAT WE LIKE‚ÄÎTHE DOLTS AND APPEARANCES SPEAKS AGAINST US, SAYING: ‚ÄÚTHESE ARE MEN WITHOUT DUTY.‚ÄÙ WE ALWAYS HAVE THE DOLTS AND APPEARANCES AGAINST US.





227


HONESTY,9 SUPPOSING THAT THIS IS OUR VIRTUE FROM WHICH WE CANNOT GET AWAY, WE FREE SPIRITS‚ÄÎWELL, LET US WORK ON IT WITH ALL OUR MALICE AND LOVE AND NOT WEARY OF ‚ÄÚPERFECTING‚ÄÙ OURSELVES IN OUR VIRTUE, THE ONLY ONE LEFT US. MAY ITS SPLENDOR REMAIN SPREAD OUT ONE DAY LIKE A GILDED BLUE MOCKING EVENING LIGHT OVER THIS AGING CULTURE AND ITS MUSTY AND GLOOMY SERIOUSNESS! AND IF OUR HONESTY SHOULD NEVERTHELESS GROW WEARY ONE DAY AND SIGH AND STRETCH ITS LIMBS AND FIND US TOO HARD, AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THINGS BETTER, EASIER, TENDERER, LIKE AN AGREEABLE VICE‚ÄÎLET US REMAIN HARD, WE LAST STOICS! AND LET US DISPATCH TO HER ASSISTANCE WHATEVER WE HAVE IN US OF DEVILRY: OUR DISGUST WITH WHAT IS CLUMSY AND APPROXIMATE, OUR ‚ÄÚNITIMUR IN VETITUM,‚ÄÙ10 OUR ADVENTUROUS COURAGE, OUR SEASONED AND CHOOSY CURIOSITY, OUR SUBTLEST, MOST DISGUISED, MOST SPIRITUAL WILL TO POWER AND OVERCOMING OF THE WORLD THAT FLIES AND FLUTTERS COVETOUSLY AROUND ALL THE REALMS OF THE FUTURE‚ÄÎLET US COME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF OUR ‚ÄÚGOD‚ÄÙ WITH ALL OUR ‚ÄÚDEVILS‚ÄÙ!

IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE SHALL BE MISUNDERSTOOD AND MISTAKEN FOR OTHERS ON THIS ACCOUNT: WHAT MATTER?11 AND EVEN IF THEY WERE RIGHT! HAVE NOT ALL GODS SO FAR BEEN SUCH DEVILS WHO HAVE BECOME HOLY AND BEEN REBAPTIZED? AND WHAT ULTIMATELY DO WE KNOW OF OURSELVES? AND HOW THE SPIRIT THAT LEADS US WOULD LIKE TO BE CALLED? (IT IS A MATTER OF NAMES.) AND HOW MANY SPIRITS WE HARBOR?

OUR HONESTY, WE FREE SPIRITS‚ÄÎLET US SEE TO IT THAT IT DOES NOT BECOME OUR VANITY, OUR FINERY AND POMP, OUR LIMIT, OUR STUPIDITY. EVERY VIRTUE INCLINES TOWARD STUPIDITY; EVERY STUPIDITY, TOWARD VIRTUE. ‚ÄÚSTUPID TO THE POINT OF HOLINESS,‚ÄÙ THEY SAY IN RUSSIA; LET US SEE TO IT THAT OUT OF HONESTY WE DO NOT FINALLY BECOME SAINTS AND BORES. IS NOT LIFE A HUNDRED TIMES TOO SHORT‚ÄÎFOR BOREDOM? ONE REALLY WOULD HAVE TO BELIEVE IN ETERNAL LIFE TO‚ÄÎ

MAY I BE FORGIVEN THE DISCOVERY THAT ALL MORAL PHILOSOPHY SO FAR HAS BEEN BORING AND WAS A SOPORIFIC AND THAT ‚ÄÚVIRTUE‚ÄÙ HAS BEEN IMPAIRED MORE FOR ME BY ITS BORING ADVOCATES THAN BY ANYTHING ELSE, THOUGH I AM NOT DENYING THEIR GENERAL UTILITY. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT AS FEW PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE SHOULD THINK ABOUT MORALITY; HENCE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT MORALITY SHOULD NOT ONE DAY BECOME INTERESTING. BUT THERE IS NO REASON FOR WORRY. THINGS STILL STAND TODAY AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS STOOD: I SEE NOBODY IN EUROPE WHO HAS (LET ALONE, PROMOTES) ANY AWARENESS THAT THINKING ABOUT MORALITY COULD BECOME DANGEROUS, CAPTIOUS, SEDUCTIVE‚ÄÎTHAT THERE MIGHT BE ANY CALAMITY INVOLVED.

CONSIDER, FOR EXAMPLE, THE INDEFATIGABLE, INEVITABLE BRITISH UTILITARIANS, HOW THEY WALK CLUMSILY AND HONORABLY IN BENTHAM‚ÄÔS FOOTSTEPS, WALKING ALONG (A HOMERIC SIMILE SAYS IT MORE PLAINLY), EVEN AS HE HIMSELF HAD ALREADY WALKED IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE HONORABLE HELV√©TIUS12 (NO, HE WAS NO DANGEROUS PERSON, THIS HELV√©TIUS, CE S√©NATEUR POCOCURANTE,13 TO SPEAK WITH GALIANI). NOT A NEW IDEA, NO TRACE OF A SUBTLER VERSION OR TWIST OF AN OLD IDEA, NOT EVEN A REAL HISTORY OF WHAT HAD BEEN THOUGHT BEFORE: ALTOGETHER AN IMPOSSIBLE LITERATURE, UNLESS ONE KNOWS HOW TO FLAVOR IT WITH SOME MALICE.

FOR INTO THESE MORALISTS, TOO (ONE SIMPLY HAS TO READ THEM WITH ULTERIOR THOUGHTS, IF ONE HAS TO READ THEM), THAT OLD ENGLISH VICE HAS CREPT WHICH IS CALLED CANT AND CONSISTS IN MORAL TARTUFFERY; ONLY THIS TIME IT HIDES IN A NEW, SCIENTIFIC, FORM. A SECRET FIGHT AGAINST A BAD CONSCIENCE IS NOT LACKING EITHER, AS IT IS ONLY FAIR THAT A RACE OF FORMER PURITANS WILL HAVE A BAD CONSCIENCE WHENEVER IT TRIES TO DEAL WITH MORALITY SCIENTIFICALLY. (ISN‚ÄÔT A MORAL PHILOSOPHER THE OPPOSITE OF A PURITAN? NAMELY, INSOFAR AS HE IS A THINKER WHO CONSIDERS MORALITY QUESTIONABLE, AS CALLING FOR QUESTION MARKS, IN SHORT AS A PROBLEM? SHOULD MORALIZING NOT BE‚ÄÎIMMORAL?)

ULTIMATELY THEY ALL WANT ENGLISH MORALITY TO BE PROVED RIGHT‚ÄÎBECAUSE THIS SERVES HUMANITY BEST, OR ‚ÄÚTHE GENERAL UTILITY,‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚTHE HAPPINESS OF THE GREATEST NUMBER‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎNO, THE HAPPINESS OF ENGLAND. WITH ALL THEIR POWERS THEY WANT TO PROVE TO THEMSELVES THAT THE STRIVING FOR ENGLISH HAPPINESS‚ÄÎI MEAN FOR COMFORT AND FASHION14(AND AT BEST A SEAT IN PARLIAMENT)‚ÄÎIS AT THE SAME TIME ALSO THE RIGHT WAY TO VIRTUE; INDEED THAT WHATEVER VIRTUE HAS EXISTED IN THE WORLD SO FAR MUST HAVE CONSISTED IN SUCH STRIVING.

NONE OF THESE PONDEROUS HERD ANIMALS WITH THEIR UNQUIET CONSCIENCES (WHO UNDERTAKE TO ADVOCATE THE CAUSE OF EGOISM AS THE CAUSE OF THE GENERAL WELFARE) WANTS TO KNOW OR EVEN SENSE THAT ‚ÄÚTHE GENERAL WELFARE‚ÄÙ IS NO IDEAL, NO GOAL, NO REMOTELY INTELLIGIBLE CONCEPT, BUT ONLY AN EMETIC‚ÄÎTHAT WHAT IS FAIR FOR ONE CANNOT BY ANY MEANS FOR THAT REASON ALONE ALSO BE FAIR FOR OTHERS; THAT THE DEMAND OF ONE MORALITY FOR ALL IS DETRIMENTAL FOR THE HIGHER MEN; IN SHORT, THAT THERE IS AN ORDER OF RANK BETWEEN MAN AND MAN, HENCE ALSO BETWEEN MORALITY AND MORALITY. THEY ARE A MODEST AND THOROUGHLY MEDIOCRE TYPE OF MAN, THESE UTILITARIAN ENGLISHMEN, AND, AS SAID ABOVE, INSOFAR AS THEY ARE BORING ONE CANNOT THINK HIGHLY ENOUGH OF THEIR UTILITY. THEY SHOULD EVEN BE ENCOURAGED: THE FOLLOWING RHYMES REPRESENT AN EFFORT IN THIS DIRECTION.

HAIL, DEAR DRUDGE AND PATIENT FRETTER!

‚ÄÚMORE DRAWN OUT IS ALWAYS BETTER,‚ÄÙ

STIFFNESS GROWS IN HEAD AND KNEE,

NO ENTHUSIAST AND NO JOKER,

INDESTRUCTIBLY MEDIOCRE,

SANS G√©NIE ET SANS ESPRIT!15

IN LATE AGES THAT MAY BE PROUD OF THEIR HUMANITY, SO MUCH FEAR REMAINS, SO MUCH SUPERSTITIOUS FEAR OF THE ‚ÄÚSAVAGE CRUEL BEAST‚ÄÙ WHOSE CONQUEST IS THE VERY PRIDE OF THESE MORE HUMANE AGES, THAT EVEN PALPABLE TRUTHS REMAIN UNSPOKEN FOR CENTURIES, AS IF BY SOME AGREEMENT, BECAUSE THEY LOOK AS IF THEY MIGHT REANIMATE THAT SAVAGE BEAST ONE HAS FINALLY ‚ÄÚMORTIFIED.‚ÄÙ PERHAPS I DARE SOMETHING WHEN I LET ONE OF THESE TRUTHS SLIP OUT: LET OTHERS CATCH IT AGAIN AND GIVE IT ‚ÄÚMILK OF THE PIOUS WAYS OF THINKING‚ÄÙ16 TO DRINK UNTIL IT LIES STILL AND FORGOTTEN IN ITS OLD CORNER.

WE SHOULD RECONSIDER CRUELTY AND OPEN OUR EYES. WE SHOULD AT LONG LAST LEARN IMPATIENCE LEST SUCH IMMODEST FAT ERRORS KEEP ON STRUTTING ABOUT VIRTUOUSLY AND SAUCILY, AS HAVE BEEN FOSTERED ABOUT TRAGEDY, FOR EXAMPLE, BY PHILOSOPHERS BOTH ANCIENT AND MODERN. ALMOST EVERYTHING WE CALL ‚ÄÚHIGHER CULTURE‚ÄÙ IS BASED ON THE SPIRITUALIZATION OF CRUELTY, ON ITS BECOMING MORE PROFOUND: THIS IS MY PROPOSITION. THAT ‚ÄÚSAVAGE ANIMAL‚ÄÙ HAS NOT REALLY BEEN ‚ÄÚMORTIFIED;‚ÄÙ IT LIVES AND FLOURISHES, IT HAS MERELY BECOME‚ÄÎDIVINE.

WHAT CONSTITUTES THE PAINFUL VOLUPTUOUSNESS OF TRAGEDY IS CRUELTY; WHAT SEEMS AGREEABLE IN SO-CALLED TRAGIC PITY, AND AT BOTTOM IN EVERYTHING SUBLIME, UP TO THE HIGHEST AND MOST DELICATE SHUDDERS OF METAPHYSICS, RECEIVES ITS SWEETNESS SOLELY FROM THE ADMIXTURE OF CRUELTY. WHAT THE ROMAN IN THE ARENA, THE CHRISTIAN IN THE ECSTASIES OF THE CROSS, THE SPANIARD AT AN AUTO-DA-FE OR BULLFIGHT, THE JAPANESE OF TODAY WHEN HE FLOCKS TO TRAGEDIES, THE LABORER IN A PARISIAN SUBURB WHO FEELS A NOSTALGIA FOR BLOODY REVOLUTIONS, THE WAGNERIENNE WHO ‚ÄÚSUBMITS TO‚ÄÙ TRISTAN AND ISOLDE, HER WILL SUSPENDED‚ÄÎWHAT ALL OF THEM ENJOY AND SEEK TO DRINK IN WITH MYSTERIOUS ARDOR ARE THE SPICY POTIONS OF THE GREAT CIRCE, ‚ÄÚCRUELTY.‚ÄÙ

TO SEE THIS WE MUST, OF COURSE, CHASE AWAY THE CLUMSY PSYCHOLOGY OF BYGONE TIMES WHICH HAD NOTHING TO TEACH ABOUT CRUELTY EXCEPT THAT IT CAME INTO BEING AT THE SIGHT OF THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS. THERE IS ALSO AN ABUNDANT, OVER-ABUNDANT ENJOYMENT AT ONE‚ÄÔS OWN SUFFERING, AT MAKING ONESELF SUFFER‚ÄÎAND WHEREVER MAN ALLOWS HIMSELF TO BE PERSUADED TO SELF-DENIAL IN THE RELIGIOUS SENSE, OR TO SELF-MUTILATION, AS AMONG PHOENICIANS AND ASCETICS, OR ALTOGETHER TO DESENSUALIZATION, DECARNALIZATION, CONTRITION, PURITANICAL SPASMS OF PENITENCE, VIVISECTION OF THE CONSCIENCE, AND SACRIFIZIO DELL‚ÄÔINTELLETTO17 √† LA PASCAL, HE IS SECRETLY LURED AND PUSHED FORWARD BY HIS CRUELTY, BY THOSE DANGEROUS THRILLS OF CRUELTY TURNED AGAINST ONESELF.

FINALLY CONSIDER THAT EVEN THE SEEKER AFTER KNOWLEDGE FORCES HIS SPIRIT TO RECOGNIZE THINGS AGAINST THE INCLINATION OF THE SPIRIT, AND OFTEN ENOUGH ALSO AGAINST THE WISHES OF HIS HEART‚ÄÎBY WAY OF SAYING NO WHERE HE WOULD LIKE TO SAY YES, LOVE, AND ADORE‚ÄÎAND THUS ACTS AS AN ARTIST AND TRANSFIGURER OF CRUELTY. INDEED, ANY INSISTENCE ON PROFUNDITY AND THOROUGHNESS IS A VIOLATION, A DESIRE TO HURT THE BASIC WILL OF THE SPIRIT WHICH UNCEASINGLY STRIVES FOR THE APPARENT AND SUPERFICIAL‚ÄÎIN ALL DESIRE TO KNOW THERE IS A DROP OF CRUELTY.





230


WHAT I HAVE JUST SAID OF A ‚ÄÚBASIC WILL OF THE SPIRIT‚ÄÙ MAY NOT BE READILY UNDERSTOOD: PERMIT ME AN EXPLANATION.

THAT COMMANDING SOMETHING WHICH THE PEOPLE CALL ‚ÄÚTHE SPIRIT‚ÄÙ WANTS TO BE MASTER IN AND AROUND ITS OWN HOUSE AND WANTS TO FEEL THAT IT IS MASTER; IT HAS THE WILL FROM MULTIPLICITY TO SIMPLICITY, A WILL THAT TIES UP, TAMES, AND IS DOMINEERING AND TRULY MASTERFUL. ITS NEEDS AND CAPACITIES ARE SO FAR THE SAME AS THOSE WHICH PHYSIOLOGISTS POSIT FOR EVERYTHING THAT LIVES, GROWS, AND MULTIPLIES. THE SPIRIT‚ÄÔS POWER TO APPROPRIATE THE FOREIGN STANDS REVEALED IN ITS INCLINATION TO ASSIMILATE THE NEW TO THE OLD, TO SIMPLIFY THE MANIFOLD, AND TO OVERLOOK OR REPULSE WHATEVER IS TOTALLY CONTRADICTORY‚ÄÎJUST AS IT INVOLUNTARILY EMPHASIZES CERTAIN FEATURES AND LINES IN WHAT IS FOREIGN, IN EVERY PIECE OF THE ‚ÄÚEXTERNAL WORLD,‚ÄÙ RETOUCHING AND FALSIFYING THE WHOLE TO SUIT ITSELF. ITS INTENT IN ALL THIS IS TO INCORPORATE NEW ‚ÄÚEXPERIENCES,‚ÄÙ TO FILE NEW THINGS IN OLD FILES‚ÄÎGROWTH, IN A WORD‚ÄÎOR, MORE PRECISELY, THE FEELING OF GROWTH, THE FEELING OF INCREASED POWER.

AN APPARENTLY OPPOSITE DRIVE SERVES THIS SAME WILL: A SUDDENLY ERUPTING DECISION IN FAVOR OF IGNORANCE, OF DELIBERATE EXCLUSION, A SHUTTING OF ONE‚ÄÔS WINDOWS, AN INTERNAL NO TO THIS OR THAT THING, A REFUSAL TO LET THINGS APPROACH, A KIND OF STATE OF DEFENSE AGAINST MUCH THAT IS KNOWABLE, A SATISFACTION WITH THE DARK, WITH THE LIMITING HORIZON, A YEA AND AMEN TO IGNORANCE‚ÄÎALL OF WHICH IS NECESSARY IN PROPORTION TO A SPIRIT‚ÄÔS POWER TO APPROPRIATE, ITS ‚ÄÚDIGESTIVE CAPACITY,‚ÄÙ TO SPEAK METAPHORICALLY‚ÄÎAND ACTUALLY ‚ÄÚTHE SPIRIT‚ÄÙ IS RELATIVELY MOST SIMILAR TO A STOMACH.

HERE BELONGS ALSO THE OCCASIONAL WILL OF THE SPIRIT TO LET ITSELF BE DECEIVED, PERHAPS WITH A CAPRICIOUS INTIMATION OF THE FACT THAT SUCH AND SUCH IS NOT THE CASE, THAT ONE MERELY ACCEPTS SUCH AND SUCH A DELIGHT IN ALL UNCERTAINTY AND AMBIGUITY, A JUBILANT SELF-ENJOYMENT IN THE ARBITRARY NARROWNESS AND SECRECY OF SOME NOOK, IN THE ALL TOO NEAR, IN THE FOREGROUND, IN WHAT IS ENLARGED, DIMINISHED, DISPLACED, BEAUTIFIED, A SELF-ENJOYMENT IN THE CAPRICE OF ALL THESE EXPRESSIONS OF POWER.

HERE BELONGS ALSO, FINALLY, THAT BY NO MEANS UNPROBLEMATIC READINESS OF THE SPIRIT TO DECEIVE OTHER SPIRITS AND TO DISSIMULATE IN FRONT OF THEM, THAT CONTINUAL URGE AND SURGE OF A CREATIVE, FORM-GIVING, CHANGEABLE FORCE: IN THIS THE SPIRIT ENJOYS THE MULTIPLICITY AND CRAFTINESS OF ITS MASKS, IT ALSO ENJOYS THE FEELING OF ITS SECURITY BEHIND THEM: AFTER ALL, IT IS SURELY ITS PROTEAN ARTS THAT DEFEND AND CONCEAL IT BEST.

THIS WILL TO MERE APPEARANCE, TO SIMPLIFICATION, TO MASKS, TO CLOAKS, IN SHORT, TO THE SURFACE‚ÄÎFOR EVERY SURFACE IS A CLOAK‚ÄÎIS COUNTERED BY THAT SUBLIME INCLINATION OF THE SEEKER AFTER KNOWLEDGE WHO INSISTS ON PROFUNDITY, MULTIPLICITY, AND THOROUGHNESS, WITH A WILL WHICH IS A KIND OF CRUELTY OF THE INTELLECTUAL CONSCIENCE AND TASTE. EVERY COURAGEOUS THINKER WILL RECOGNIZE THIS IN HIMSELF, ASSUMING ONLY THAT, AS FIT, HE HAS HARDENED AND SHARPENED HIS EYE FOR HIMSELF LONG ENOUGH AND THAT HE IS USED TO SEVERE DISCIPLINE, AS WELL AS SEVERE WORDS. HE WILL SAY: ‚ÄÚTHERE IS SOMETHING CRUEL IN THE INCLINATION OF MY SPIRIT;‚ÄÙ LET THE VIRTUOUS AND KINDLY TRY TO TALK HIM OUT OF THAT!

INDEED, IT WOULD SOUND NICER IF WE WERE SAID, WHISPERED, REPUTED18 TO BE DISTINGUISHED NOT BY CRUELTY BUT BY ‚ÄÚEXTRAVAGANT HONESTY,‚ÄÙ WE FREE, VERY FREE SPIRITS‚ÄÎAND PERHAPS THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE OUR‚ÄÎPOSTHUMOUS REPUTATION.19 MEANWHILE‚ÄÎFOR THERE IS PLENTY OF TIME UNTIL THEN‚ÄÎWE OURSELVES ARE PROBABLY LEAST INCLINED TO PUT ON THE GARISH FINERY OF SUCH MORAL WORD TINSELS: OUR WHOLE WORK SO FAR MAKES US SICK OF THIS TASTE AND ITS CHEERFUL LUXURY. THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL, GLITTERING, JINGLING, FESTIVE WORDS: HONESTY, LOVE OF TRUTH, LOVE OF WISDOM, SACRIFICE FOR KNOWLEDGE, HEROISM OF THE TRUTHFUL‚ÄÎTHEY HAVE SOMETHING THAT SWELLS ONE‚ÄÔS PRIDE. BUT WE HERMITS AND MARMOTS HAVE LONG PERSUADED OURSELVES IN THE FULL SECRECY OF A HERMIT‚ÄÔS CONSCIENCE THAT THIS WORTHY VERBAL POMP, TOO, BELONGS TO THE OLD MENDACIOUS POMP, JUNK, AND GOLD DUST OF UNCONSCIOUS HUMAN VANITY, AND THAT UNDER SUCH FLATTERING COLORS AND MAKE-UP AS WELL, THE BASIC TEXT OF HOMO NATURA MUST AGAIN BE RECOGNIZED.

TO TRANSLATE MAN BACK INTO NATURE; TO BECOME MASTER OVER THE MANY VAIN AND OVERLY ENTHUSIASTIC INTERPRETATIONS AND CONNOTATIONS THAT HAVE SO FAR BEEN SCRAWLED AND PAINTED OVER THAT ETERNAL BASIC TEXT OF HOMO NATURA; TO SEE TO IT THAT MAN HENCEFORTH STANDS BEFORE MAN AS EVEN TODAY, HARDENED IN THE DISCIPLINE OF SCIENCE, HE STANDS BEFORE THE REST OF NATURE, WITH INTREPID OEDIPUS EYES AND SEALED ODYSSEUS EARS, DEAF TO THE SIREN SONGS OF OLD METAPHYSICAL BIRD CATCHERS WHO HAVE BEEN PIPING AT HIM ALL TOO LONG, ‚ÄÚYOU ARE MORE, YOU ARE HIGHER, YOU ARE OF A DIFFERENT ORIGIN!‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT MAY BE A STRANGE AND INSANE TASK, BUT IT IS A TASK‚ÄÎWHO WOULD DENY THAT? WHY DID WE CHOOSE THIS INSANE TASK? OR, PUTTING IT DIFFERENTLY: ‚ÄÚWHY HAVE KNOWLEDGE AT ALL?‚ÄÙ

EVERYBODY WILL ASK US THAT. AND WE, PRESSED THIS WAY, WE WHO HAVE PUT THE SAME QUESTION TO OURSELVES A HUNDRED TIMES, WE HAVE FOUND AND FIND NO BETTER ANSWER‚ÄÎ





231


LEARNING CHANGES US; IT DOES WHAT ALL NOURISHMENT DOES WHICH ALSO DOES NOT MERELY ‚ÄÚPRESERVE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAS PHYSIOLOGISTS KNOW. BUT AT THE BOTTOM OF US, REALLY ‚ÄÚDEEP DOWN,‚ÄÙ THERE IS, OF COURSE, SOMETHING UNTEACHABLE, SOME GRANITE OF SPIRITUAL FATUM,20 OF PREDETERMINED DECISION AND ANSWER TO PREDETERMINED SELECTED QUESTIONS. WHENEVER A CARDINAL PROBLEM IS AT STAKE, THERE SPEAKS AN UNCHANGEABLE ‚ÄÚTHIS IS I;‚ÄÙ ABOUT MAN AND WOMAN, FOR EXAMPLE, A THINKER CANNOT RELEARN BUT ONLY FINISH LEARNING‚ÄÎONLY DISCOVER ULTIMATELY HOW THIS IS ‚ÄÚSETTLED IN HIM.‚ÄÙ AT TIMES WE FIND CERTAIN SOLUTIONS OF PROBLEMS THAT INSPIRE STRONG FAITH IN US; SOME CALL THEM HENCEFORTH THEIR ‚ÄÚCONVICTIONS.‚ÄÙ LATER‚ÄÎWE SEE THEM ONLY AS STEPS TO SELF-KNOWLEDGE, SIGNPOSTS TO THE PROBLEM WE ARE‚ÄÎRATHER, TO THE GREAT STUPIDITY WE ARE, TO OUR SPIRITUAL FATUM, TO WHAT IS UNTEACHABLE VERY ‚ÄÚDEEP DOWN.‚ÄÙ21

AFTER THIS ABUNDANT CIVILITY THAT I HAVE JUST EVIDENCED IN RELATION TO MYSELF I SHALL PERHAPS BE PERMITTED MORE READILY TO STATE A FEW TRUTHS ABOUT ‚ÄÚWOMAN AS SUCH‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎASSUMING THAT IT IS NOW KNOWN FROM THE OUTSET HOW VERY MUCH THESE ARE AFTER ALL ONLY‚ÄÎMY TRUTHS.





232


WOMAN WANTS TO BECOME SELF-RELIANT‚ÄÎAND FOR THAT REASON SHE IS BEGINNING TO ENLIGHTEN MEN ABOUT ‚ÄÚWOMAN AS SUCH‚ÄÙ: THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST DEVELOPMENTS OF THE GENERAL UGLIFICATION OF EUROPE. FOR WHAT MUST THESE CLUMSY ATTEMPTS OF WOMEN AT SCIENTIFIC SELF-EXPOSURE BRING TO LIGHT! WOMAN HAS MUCH REASON FOR SHAME; SO MUCH PEDANTRY, SUPERFICIALITY, SCHOOLMARMISHNESS, PETTY PRESUMPTION, PETTY LICENTIOUSNESS AND IMMODESTY LIES CONCEALED IN WOMAN‚ÄÎONE ONLY NEEDS TO STUDY HER BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN!‚ÄÎAND SO FAR ALL THIS WAS AT BOTTOM BEST REPRESSED AND KEPT UNDER CONTROL BY FEAR OF MAN. WOE WHEN ‚ÄÚTHE ETERNALLY BORING IN WOMAN‚ÄÙ22‚ÄÎSHE IS RICH IN THAT!‚ÄÎIS PERMITTED TO VENTURE FORTH! WHEN SHE BEGINS TO UNLEARN THOROUGHLY AND ON PRINCIPLE HER PRUDENCE AND ART‚ÄÎOF GRACE, OF PLAY, OF CHASING AWAY WORRIES, OF LIGHTENING BURDENS AND TAKING THINGS LIGHTLY‚ÄÎAND HER SUBTLE APTITUDE FOR AGREEABLE DESIRES!

EVEN NOW FEMALE VOICES ARE HEARD WHICH‚ÄÎHOLY ARISTOPHANES!‚ÄÎARE FRIGHTENING: THEY THREATEN WITH MEDICAL EXPLICITNESS WHAT WOMAN WANTS FROM MAN, FIRST AND LAST. IS IT NOT IN THE WORST TASTE WHEN WOMAN SETS ABOUT BECOMING SCIENTIFIC THAT WAY? SO FAR ENLIGHTENMENT OF THIS SORT WAS FORTUNATELY MAN‚ÄÔS AFFAIR, MAN‚ÄÔS LOT‚ÄÎWE REMAINED ‚ÄÚAMONG OURSELVES‚ÄÙ IN THIS; AND WHATEVER WOMEN WRITE ABOUT ‚ÄÚWOMAN,‚ÄÙ WE MAY IN THE END RESERVE A HEALTHY SUSPICION WHETHER WOMAN REALLY WANTS ENLIGHTENMENT ABOUT HERSELF‚ÄÎWHETHER SHE CAN WILL IT‚ÄÎ

UNLESS A WOMAN SEEKS A NEW ADORNMENT FOR HERSELF THAT WAY‚ÄÎI DO THINK ADORNING HERSELF IS PART OF THE ETERNAL-FEMININE?‚ÄÎSHE SURELY WANTS TO INSPIRE FEAR OF HERSELF‚ÄÎPERHAPS SHE SEEKS MASTERY. BUT SHE DOES NOT WANT TRUTH: WHAT IS TRUTH TO WOMAN? FROM THE BEGINNING, NOTHING HAS BEEN MORE ALIEN, REPUGNANT, AND HOSTILE TO WOMAN THAN TRUTH‚ÄÎHER GREAT ART IS THE LIE, HER HIGHEST CONCERN IS MERE APPEARANCE AND BEAUTY. LET US MEN CONFESS IT: WE HONOR AND LOVE PRECISELY THIS ART AND THIS INSTINCT IN WOMAN‚ÄÎWE WHO HAVE A HARD TIME AND FOR OUR RELIEF LIKE TO ASSOCIATE WITH BEINGS UNDER WHOSE HANDS, EYES, AND TENDER FOLLIES OUR SERIOUSNESS, OUR GRAVITY AND PROFUNDITY23 ALMOST APPEAR TO US LIKE FOLLY.

FINALLY I POSE THE QUESTION: HAS EVER A WOMAN CONCEDED PROFUNDITY TO A WOMAN‚ÄÔS HEAD, OR JUSTICE TO A WOMAN‚ÄÔS HEART? AND IS IT NOT TRUE THAT ON THE WHOLE ‚ÄÚWOMAN‚ÄÙ HAS SO FAR BEEN DESPISED MOST BY WOMAN HERSELF‚ÄÎAND BY NO MEANS BY US?

WE MEN WISH THAT WOMAN SHOULD NOT GO ON COMPROMISING HERSELF THROUGH ENLIGHTENMENT‚ÄÎJUST AS IT WAS MAN‚ÄÔS THOUGHTFULNESS AND CONSIDERATION FOR WOMAN THAT FOUND EXPRESSION IN THE CHURCH DECREE: MULIER TACEAT IN ECCLESIA!24 IT WAS FOR WOMAN‚ÄÔS GOOD WHEN NAPOLEON GAVE THE ALL TOO ELOQUENT MADAME DE STA√´L TO UNDERSTAND: MULIER TACEAT IN POLITICIS!25 AND I THINK IT IS A REAL FRIEND OF WOMEN THAT COUNSELS THEM TODAY: MULIER TACEAT DE MULIERE!26

IT BETRAYS A CORRUPTION OF THE INSTINCTS‚ÄÎQUITE APART FROM THE FACT THAT IT BETRAYS BAD TASTE‚ÄÎWHEN A WOMAN ADDUCES MADAME ROLAND OR MADAME DE STA√´L OR MONSIEUR GEORGE SAND, OF ALL PEOPLE, AS IF THEY PROVED ANYTHING IN FAVOR OF ‚ÄÚWOMAN AS SUCH.‚ÄÙ AMONG MEN THESE THREE ARE THE THREE COMICAL WOMEN AS SUCH‚ÄÎNOTHING MORE!‚ÄÎAND PRECISELY THE BEST INVOLUNTARY COUNTERARGUMENTS AGAINST EMANCIPATION AND FEMININE VAINGLORY.

STUPIDITY IN THE KITCHEN; WOMAN AS COOK: THE GRUESOME THOUGHTLESSNESS TO WHICH THE FEEDING OF THE FAMILY AND OF THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE IS ABANDONED! WOMAN DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT FOOD MEANS‚ÄÎAND WANTS TO BE COOK. IF WOMAN WERE A THINKING CREATURE, SHE, AS COOK FOR MILLENNIA, WOULD SURELY HAVE HAD TO DISCOVER THE GREATEST PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTS, AND SHE WOULD HAVE HAD TO GAIN POSSESSION OF THE ART OF HEALING. BAD COOKS‚ÄÎAND THE UTTER LACK OF REASON IN THE KITCHEN‚ÄÎHAVE DELAYED HUMAN DEVELOPMENT LONGEST AND IMPAIRED IT MOST: NOR HAVE THINGS IMPROVED MUCH EVEN TODAY.

THERE ARE EXPRESSIONS AND BULL‚ÄÔS-EYES OF THE SPIRIT, THERE ARE EPIGRAMS, A LITTLE HANDFUL OF WORDS, IN WHICH A WHOLE CULTURE, A WHOLE SOCIETY IS SUDDENLY CRYSTALLIZED. AMONG THESE BELONGS THE OCCASIONAL REMARK OF MADAME DE LAMBERT TO HER SON: ‚ÄÚMON AMI, NE VOUS PERMETTEZ JAMAIS QUE DE FOLIES, QUI VOUS FERONT GRAND PLAISIR‚ÄÙ27‚ÄÎINCIDENTALLY THE MOST MOTHERLY AND PRUDENT WORD EVER DIRECTED TO A SON.

MEN HAVE SO FAR TREATED WOMEN LIKE BIRDS WHO HAD STRAYED TO THEM FROM SOME HEIGHT: AS SOMETHING MORE REFINED AND VULNERABLE, WILDER, STRANGER, SWEETER, AND MORE SOULFUL‚ÄÎBUT AS SOMETHING ONE HAS TO LOCK UP LEST IT FLY AWAY.





238


TO GO WRONG ON THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM OF ‚ÄÚMAN AND WOMAN,‚ÄÙ TO DENY THE MOST ABYSMAL ANTAGONISM BETWEEN THEM AND THE NECESSITY OF AN ETERNALLY HOSTILE TENSION, TO DREAM PERHAPS OF EQUAL RIGHTS, EQUAL EDUCATION, EQUAL CLAIMS AND OBLIGATIONS‚ÄÎTHAT IS A TYPICAL SIGN OF SHALLOWNESS, AND A THINKER WHO HAS PROVED SHALLOW IN THIS DANGEROUS PLACE‚ÄÎSHALLOW IN HIS INSTINCT‚ÄÎMAY BE CONSIDERED ALTOGETHER SUSPICIOUS, EVEN MORE‚ÄÎBETRAYED, EXPOSED: PROBABLY HE WILL BE TOO ‚ÄÚSHORT‚ÄÙ FOR ALL FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS OF LIFE, OF THE LIFE YET TO COME, TOO, AND INCAPABLE OF ATTAINING ANY DEPTH.31 A MAN, ON THE OTHER HAND, WHO HAS DEPTH, IN HIS SPIRIT AS WELL AS IN HIS DESIRES, INCLUDING THAT DEPTH OF BENEVOLENCE WHICH IS CAPABLE OF SEVERITY AND HARDNESS AND EASILY MISTAKEN FOR THEM, MUST ALWAYS THINK ABOUT WOMAN AS ORIENTALS DO: HE MUST CONCEIVE OF WOMAN AS A POSSESSION, AS PROPERTY THAT CAN BE LOCKED, AS SOMETHING PREDESTINED FOR SERVICE AND ACHIEVING HER PERFECTION IN THAT. HERE HE MUST BASE HIMSELF ON THE TREMENDOUS REASON OF ASIA, ON ASIA‚ÄÔS SUPERIORITY IN THE INSTINCTS, AS THE GREEKS DID FORMERLY, WHO WERE ASIA‚ÄÔS BEST HEIRS AND STUDENTS: AS IS WELL KNOWN, FROM HOMER‚ÄÔS TIME TO THE AGE OF PERICLES, AS THEIR CULTURE INCREASED ALONG WITH THE RANGE OF THEIR POWERS, THEY ALSO GRADUALLY BECAME MORE SEVERE, IN BRIEF, MORE ORIENTAL, AGAINST WOMAN. HOW NECESSARY, HOW LOGICAL, HOW HUMANELY DESIRABLE EVEN, THIS WAS‚ÄÎIS WORTH PONDERING.





239


IN NO AGE HAS THE WEAKER SEX BEEN TREATED WITH AS MUCH RESPECT BY MEN AS IN OURS: THAT BELONGS TO THE DEMOCRATIC INCLINATION AND BASIC TASTE, JUST LIKE DISRESPECTFULNESS FOR OLD AGE. NO WONDER THAT THIS RESPECT IS IMMEDIATELY ABUSED. ONE WANTS MORE, ONE LEARNS TO DEMAND, FINALLY ONE ALMOST FINDS THIS TRIBUTE OF RESPECT INSULTING, ONE WOULD PREFER COMPETITION FOR RIGHTS, INDEED EVEN A GENUINE FIGHT: ENOUGH, WOMAN LOSES HER MODESTY. LET US IMMEDIATELY ADD THAT SHE ALSO LOSES TASTE. SHE UNLEARNS HER FEAR OF MAN: BUT THE WOMAN WHO ‚ÄÚUNLEARNS FEAR‚ÄÙ SURRENDERS HER MOST WOMANLY INSTINCTS.

THAT WOMAN VENTURES FORTH WHEN THE ASPECT OF MAN THAT INSPIRES FEAR‚ÄÎLET US SAY MORE PRECISELY, WHEN THE MAN IN MAN IS NO LONGER DESIRED AND CULTIVATED‚ÄÎTHAT IS FAIR ENOUGH, ALSO COMPREHENSIBLE ENOUGH. WHAT IS HARDER TO COMPREHEND IS THAT, BY THE SAME TOKEN‚ÄÎWOMAN DEGENERATES. THIS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY: LET US NOT DECEIVE OURSELVES ABOUT THAT.

WHEREVER THE INDUSTRIAL SPIRIT HAS TRIUMPHED OVER THE MILITARY AND ARISTOCRATIC SPIRIT, WOMAN NOW ASPIRES TO THE ECONOMIC AND LEGAL SELF-RELIANCE OF A CLERK:32 ‚ÄÚWOMAN AS CLERK‚ÄÙ IS INSCRIBED ON THE GATE TO THE MODERN SOCIETY THAT IS TAKING SHAPE NOW. AS SHE THUS TAKES POSSESSION OF NEW RIGHTS, ASPIRES TO BECOME ‚ÄÚMASTER‚ÄÙ33 AND WRITES THE ‚ÄÚPROGRESS‚ÄÙ OF WOMAN UPON HER STANDARDS AND BANNERS, THE OPPOSITE DEVELOPMENT IS TAKING PLACE WITH TERRIBLE CLARITY: WOMAN IS RETROGRESSING.

SINCE THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, WOMAN‚ÄÔS INFLUENCE IN EUROPE HAS DECREASED PROPORTIONATELY AS HER RIGHTS AND CLAIMS HAVE INCREASED; AND THE ‚ÄÚEMANCIPATION OF WOMAN,‚ÄÙ INSOFAR AS THAT IS DEMANDED AND PROMOTED BY WOMEN THEMSELVES (AND NOT MERELY BY SHALLOW MALES) IS THUS SEEN TO BE AN ODD SYMPTOM OF THE INCREASING WEAKENING AND DULLING OF THE MOST FEMININE INSTINCTS. THERE IS STUPIDITY IN THIS MOVEMENT, AN ALMOST MASCULINE STUPIDITY OF WHICH A WOMAN WHO HAD TURNED OUT WELL‚ÄÎAND SUCH WOMEN ARE ALWAYS PRUDENT‚ÄÎWOULD HAVE TO BE THOROUGHLY ASHAMED.

TO LOSE THE SENSE FOR THE GROUND ON WHICH ONE IS MOST CERTAIN OF VICTORY; TO NEGLECT PRACTICE WITH ONE‚ÄÔS PROPER WEAPONS; TO LET ONESELF GO BEFORE MEN, PERHAPS EVEN ‚ÄÚTO THE POINT OF WRITING A BOOK,‚ÄÙ WHEN FORMERLY ONE DISCIPLINED ONESELF TO SUBTLE AND CUNNING HUMILITY; TO WORK WITH VIRTUOUS AUDACITY AGAINST MEN‚ÄÔS FAITH IN A BASICALLY DIFFERENT IDEAL THAT HE TAKES TO BE CONCEALED IN WOMAN, SOMETHING ETERNALLY-AND-NECESSARILY-FEMININE‚ÄÎTO TALK MEN EMPHATICALLY AND LOQUACIOUSLY OUT OF THEIR NOTION THAT WOMAN MUST BE MAINTAINED, TAKEN CARE OF, PROTECTED, AND INDULGED LIKE A MORE DELICATE, STRANGELY WILD, AND OFTEN PLEASANT DOMESTIC ANIMAL; THE AWKWARD AND INDIGNANT SEARCH FOR EVERYTHING SLAVELIKE AND SERFLIKE THAT HAS CHARACTERIZED WOMAN‚ÄÔS POSITION IN THE ORDER OF SOCIETY SO FAR, AND STILL DOES (AS IF SLAVERY WERE A COUNTERARGUMENT AND NOT INSTEAD A CONDITION OF EVERY HIGHER CULTURE, EVERY ENHANCEMENT OF CULTURE)‚ÄÎWHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL THIS IF NOT A CRUMBLING OF FEMININE INSTINCTS, A DEFEMINIZATION?

TO BE SURE, THERE ARE ENOUGH IMBECILIC FRIENDS AND CORRUPTERS OF WOMAN AMONG THE SCHOLARLY ASSES OF THE MALE SEX WHO ADVISE WOMAN TO DEFEMINIZE HERSELF IN THIS WAY AND TO IMITATE ALL THE STUPIDITIES WITH WHICH ‚ÄÚMAN‚ÄÙ IN EUROPE, EUROPEAN ‚ÄÚMANLINESS,‚ÄÙ IS SICK: THEY WOULD LIKE TO REDUCE WOMAN TO THE LEVEL OF ‚ÄÚGENERAL EDUCATION,‚ÄÙ PROBABLY EVEN OF READING THE NEWSPAPERS AND TALKING ABOUT POLITICS. HERE AND THERE THEY EVEN WANT TO TURN WOMEN INTO FREETHINKERS AND SCRIBBLERS‚ÄÎAS IF A WOMAN WITHOUT PIETY WOULD NOT SEEM UTTERLY OBNOXIOUS AND RIDICULOUS TO A PROFOUND AND GODLESS MAN.

ALMOST EVERYWHERE ONE RUINS HER NERVES WITH THE MOST PATHOLOGICAL AND DANGEROUS KIND OF MUSIC (OUR MOST RECENT GERMAN MUSIC) AND MAKES HER MORE HYSTERICAL BY THE DAY AND MORE INCAPABLE OF HER FIRST AND LAST PROFESSION‚ÄÎTO GIVE BIRTH TO STRONG CHILDREN. ALTOGETHER ONE WANTS TO MAKE HER MORE ‚ÄÚCULTIVATED‚ÄÙ AND, AS IS SAID, MAKE THE WEAKER SEX STRONG THROUGH CULTURE‚ÄÎAS IF HISTORY DID NOT TEACH US AS IMPRESSIVELY AS POSSIBLE THAT MAKING MEN ‚ÄÚCULTIVATED‚ÄÙ AND MAKING THEM WEAK‚ÄÎWEAKENING, SPLINTERING, AND SICKLYING OVER THE FORCE OF THE WILL‚ÄÎHAVE ALWAYS KEPT PACE, AND THAT THE MOST POWERFUL AND INFLUENTIAL WOMEN OF THE WORLD (MOST RECENTLY NAPOLEON‚ÄÔS MOTHER) OWED THEIR POWER AND ASCENDANCY OVER MEN TO THE FORCE OF THEIR WILL‚ÄÎAND NOT TO SCHOOLMASTERS!

WHAT INSPIRES RESPECT FOR WOMAN, AND OFTEN ENOUGH EVEN FEAR, IS HER NATURE, WHICH IS MORE ‚ÄÚNATURAL‚ÄÙ THAN MAN‚ÄÔS, THE GENUINE, CUNNING SUPPLENESS OF A BEAST OF PREY, THE TIGER‚ÄÔS CLAW UNDER THE GLOVE, THE NA√ØVET√© OF HER EGOISM, HER UNEDUCABILITY AND INNER WILDNESS, THE INCOMPREHENSIBILITY, SCOPE, AND MOVEMENT OF HER DESIRES AND VIRTUES‚ÄÎ

WHAT, IN SPITE OF ALL FEAR, ELICITS PITY FOR THIS DANGEROUS AND BEAUTIFUL CAT ‚ÄÚWOMAN‚ÄÙ IS THAT SHE APPEARS TO SUFFER MORE, TO BE MORE VULNERABLE, MORE IN NEED OF LOVE, AND MORE CONDEMNED TO DISAPPOINTMENT THAN ANY OTHER ANIMAL. FEAR AND PITY: WITH THESE FEELINGS MAN HAS SO FAR CONFRONTED WOMAN, ALWAYS WITH ONE FOOT IN TRAGEDY34 WHICH TEARS TO PIECES AS IT ENCHANTS.35

WHAT? AND THIS SHOULD BE THE END? AND THE BREAKING OF WOMAN‚ÄÔS MAGIC SPELL IS AT WORK? THE ‚ÄÚBORIFICATION‚ÄÙ OF WOMAN IS SLOWLY DAWNING? O EUROPE! EUROPE! WE KNOW THE HORNED ANIMAL YOU ALWAYS FOUND MOST ATTRACTIVE; IT STILL THREATENS YOU! YOUR OLD FABLE COULD YET BECOME ‚ÄÚHISTORY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎONCE MORE AN IMMENSE STUPIDITY MIGHT BECOME MASTER OVER YOU AND CARRY YOU OFF. AND THIS TIME NO GOD WOULD HIDE IN IT; NO, ONLY AN ‚ÄÚIDEA,‚ÄÙ A ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEA‚ÄÙ!‚ÄÎ

YET NIETZSCHE HERE DISSOCIATES HIMSELF FROM THESE REMARKS AND ASCRIBES THEM TO A ‚ÄÚPEDANT‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎNOT BECAUSE THEY ARE WRONG BUT BECAUSE HE CONSIDERS IT PEDANTIC AND SELF-RIGHTEOUS TO BE SO UNHUMOROUSLY AND COMPLETELY RIGHT.

BUT WHEN NIETZSCHE WROTE ECCE HOMO, IN 1888, HE NO LONGER FELT: ‚ÄÚWHAT MATTER?‚ÄÙ THUS THE FIRST SECTION OF THE PREFACE ENDS: ‚ÄÚUNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE A DUTY AGAINST WHICH MY HABITS, EVEN MORE THE PRIDE OF MY INSTINCTS, REVOLT AT BOTTOM‚ÄÎNAMELY, TO SAY: HEAR ME! FOR I AM SUCH AND SUCH A PERSON. ABOVE ALL, DO NOT MISTAKE ME FOR SOMEONE ELSE!‚ÄÙ THERE IS ALSO A NOTE OF THE PERIOD 1885-88, PUBLISHED POSTHUMOUSLY: ‚ÄÚONE GENERALLY MISTAKES ME FOR SOMEONE ELSE: I CONFESS IT; ALSO THAT I SHOULD BE DONE A GREAT SERVICE IF SOMEONE ELSE WERE TO DEFEND AND DEFINE ME AGAINST THESE MISTAKES [VERWECHSELUNGEN]‚ÄÙ (WERKE, MUSARION EDITON, VOL.

I HEARD ONCE AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME‚ÄÎRICHARD WAGNER‚ÄÔS OVERTURE TO THE MEISTERSINGER:1IT IS MAGNIFICENT, OVERCHARGED, HEAVY, LATE ART THAT HAS THE PRIDE OF PRESUPPOSING TWO CENTURIES OF MUSIC AS STILL LIVING, IF IT IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD: IT IS TO THE CREDIT OF THE GERMANS THAT SUCH PRIDE DID NOT MISCALCULATE. WHAT FLAVORS AND FORCES, WHAT SEASONS AND CLIMES ARE NOT MIXED HERE! IT STRIKES US NOW AS ARCHAIC, NOW AS STRANGE, TART, AND TOO YOUNG, IT IS JUST AS CAPRICIOUS AS IT IS POMPOUS-TRADITIONAL, IT IS NOT INFREQUENTLY SAUCY, STILL MORE OFTEN COARSE AND RUDE‚ÄÎIT HAS FIRE AND COURAGE AND AT THE SAME TIME THE LOOSE DUN SKIN OF FRUIT THAT RIPENS TOO LATE. IT FLOWS BROAD AND FULL‚ÄÎAND SUDDENLY A MOMENT OF INEXPLICABLE HESITATION, LIKE A GAP OPENING UP BETWEEN CAUSE AND EFFECT, A PRESSURE TRIGGERING DREAMS, ALMOST NIGHTMARES‚ÄÎBUT ALREADY THE OLD WIDTH AND BREADTH ARE REGAINED BY THE CURRENT OF WELL-BEING, THE MOST MANIFOLD WELL-BEING, OF OLD AND NEW HAPPINESS, VERY MUCH INCLUDING THE ARTIST‚ÄÔS HAPPINESS WITH HIMSELF WHICH HE HAS NO WISH TO HIDE, HIS AMAZED, HAPPY SHARING OF THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE MEANS HE HAS EMPLOYED HERE ARE MASTERLY‚ÄÎNEW ARTISTIC DEVICES, NEWLY ACQUIRED, NOT YET TESTED, AS HE SEEMS TO LET US KNOW.

ALTOGETHER, NO BEAUTY, NO SOUTH, NOTHING OF SOUTHERN AND SUBTLE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SKY, NOTHING OF GRACEFULNESS, NO DANCE, SCARCELY ANY WILL TO LOGIC; EVEN A CERTAIN CLUMSINESS THAT IS ACTUALLY STRESSED, AS IF THE ARTIST WISHED TO SAY TO US, ‚ÄÚTHAT IS PART OF MY INTENTION;‚ÄÙ CUMBERSOME DRAPERY, SOMETHING CAPRICIOUS, BARBARIAN, AND SOLEMN, A FLURRY OF ERUDITE PRECIOUSNESS AND LACE; SOMETHING GERMAN IN THE BEST AND WORST SENSES OF THE WORD, SOMETHING MANIFOLD, FORMLESS, AND INEXHAUSTIBLE IN A GERMAN WAY; A CERTAIN GERMAN POWERFULNESS AND OVERFULNESS OF THE SOUL WHICH IS NOT AFRAID OF HIDING BEHIND THE REFINEMENTS OF DECAY‚ÄÎWHICH PERHAPS REALLY FEELS MOST AT HOME THERE; A TRULY GENUINE TOKEN OF THE GERMAN SOUL WHICH IS AT THE SAME TIME YOUNG AND SUPERANNUATED, OVERLY MELLOW AND STILL OVERRICH IN FUTURE. THIS KIND OF MUSIC EXPRESSES BEST WHAT I THINK OF THE GERMANS: THEY BELONG TO THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY AND THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW‚ÄÎAS YET THEY HAVE NO TODAY.

WE ‚ÄÚGOOD EUROPEANS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWE, TOO, KNOW HOURS WHEN WE PERMIT OURSELVES SOME HEARTY FATHERLANDISHNESS, A PLOP AND RELAPSE INTO OLD LOVES AND NARROWNESSES‚ÄÎI HAVE JUST GIVEN A SAMPLE OF THAT‚ÄÎHOURS OF NATIONAL AGITATIONS, PATRIOTIC PALPITATIONS, AND VARIOUS OTHER SORTS OF ARCHAIZING SENTIMENTAL INUNDATIONS. MORE PONDEROUS SPIRITS THAN WE ARE MAY REQUIRE MORE TIME TO GET OVER WHAT WITH US TAKES ONLY HOURS AND IN A FEW HOURS HAS RUN ITS COURSE: SOME REQUIRE HALF A YEAR, OTHERS HALF A LIFE, DEPENDING ON THE SPEED AND POWER OF THEIR DIGESTION AND METABOLISM. INDEED, I COULD IMAGINE DULL2 AND SLUGGISH RACES WHO WOULD REQUIRE HALF A CENTURY EVEN IN OUR RAPIDLY MOVING EUROPE TO OVERCOME SUCH ATAVISTIC ATTACKS OF FATHERLANDISHNESS AND SOIL ADDICTION AND TO RETURN TO REASON, MEANING ‚ÄÚGOOD EUROPEANISM.‚ÄÙ

AS I AM DIGRESSING TO THIS POSSIBILITY, IT SO HAPPENS THAT I BECOME AN EAR-WITNESS OF A CONVERSATION BETWEEN TWO OLD ‚ÄÚPATRIOTS‚ÄÙ: APPARENTLY BOTH WERE HARD OF HEARING AND THEREFORE SPOKE THAT MUCH LOUDER.

‚ÄÚHE THINKS AND KNOWS AS MUCH OF PHILOSOPHY AS A PEASANT OR A FRATERNITY STUDENT,‚ÄÙ SAID ONE; ‚ÄÚHE IS STILL INNOCENT. BUT WHAT DOES IT MATTER TODAY? THIS IS THE AGE OF THE MASSES: THEY GROVEL ON THEIR BELLIES BEFORE ANYTHING MASSIVE. IN POLITICIS, TOO. A STATESMAN WHO PILES UP FOR THEM ANOTHER TOWER OF BABEL, A MONSTER OF EMPIRE AND POWER, THEY CALL ‚ÄÒGREAT‚ÄÔ; WHAT DOES IT MATTER THAT WE, MORE CAUTIOUS AND RESERVED, DO NOT YET ABANDON THE OLD FAITH THAT ONLY A GREAT THOUGHT CAN GIVE A DEED OR CAUSE GREATNESS. SUPPOSE A STATESMAN PUT HIS PEOPLE IN A POSITION REQUIRING THEM TO GO IN FOR ‚ÄÒGREAT POLITICS‚ÄÔ FROM NOW ON, THOUGH THEY WERE ILL-DISPOSED FOR THAT BY NATURE AND ILL PREPARED AS WELL, SO THAT THEY WOULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO SACRIFICE THEIR OLD AND SECURE VIRTUES FOR THE SAKE OF A NOVEL AND DUBIOUS MEDIOCRITY‚ÄÎSUPPOSE A STATESMAN ACTUALLY CONDEMNED HIS PEOPLE TO ‚ÄÒPOLITICKING‚ÄÔ ALTHOUGH SO FAR THEY HAD HAD BETTER THINGS TO DO AND THINK ABOUT, AND DEEP DOWN IN THEIR SOULS THEY HAD NOT GOT RID OF A CAUTIOUS DISGUST WITH THE RESTLESSNESS, EMPTINESS, AND NOISY QUARRELSOMENESS OF PEOPLES THAT REALLY GO IN FOR POLITICKING‚ÄÎSUPPOSE SUCH A STATESMAN GOADED THE SLUMBERING PASSIONS AND LUSTS OF HIS PEOPLE, TURNING THEIR DIFFIDENCE AND DELIGHT IN STANDING ASIDE INTO A BLOT, THEIR COSMOPOLITANISM AND SECRET INFINITY INTO A SERIOUS WRONG, DEVALUATING THEIR MOST CORDIAL INCLINATIONS, INVERTING THEIR CONSCIENCE, MAKING THEIR SPIRIT NARROW, THEIR TASTE ‚ÄÒNATIONAL‚ÄÔ‚ÄÎWHAT! A STATESMAN WHO DID ALL THIS, FOR WHOM HIS PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO ATONE FOR ALL FUTURE TIME, IF THEY HAVE ANY FUTURE, SUCH A STATESMAN SHOULD BE GREAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWITHOUT A DOUBT!‚ÄÙ THE OTHER PATRIOT REPLIED VEHEMENTLY; ‚ÄÚOTHERWISE HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT. PERHAPS IT WAS INSANE TO WANT SUCH A THING? BUT PERHAPS EVERYTHING GREAT WAS MERELY INSANE WHEN IT STARTED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAN ABUSE OF WORDS!‚ÄÙ HIS PARTNER SHOUTED BACK; ‚ÄÚSTRONG! STRONG! STRONG AND INSANE! NOT GREAT!‚ÄÙ

THE OLD MEN HAD OBVIOUSLY BECOME HEATED AS THEY THUS FLUNG THEIR TRUTHS INTO EACH OTHER‚ÄÔS FACES; BUT I, IN MY HAPPINESS AND BEYOND, CONSIDERED HOW SOON ONE STRONGER WILL BECOME MASTER OVER THE STRONG; ALSO THAT FOR THE SPIRITUAL FLATTENING3 OF A PEOPLE THERE IS A COMPENSATION, NAMELY THE DEEPENING OF ANOTHER PEOPLE.

CALL THAT IN WHICH THE DISTINCTION OF THE EUROPEAN IS SOUGHT ‚ÄÚCIVILIZATION‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚHUMANIZATION‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚPROGRESS,‚ÄÙ OR CALL IT SIMPLY‚ÄÎWITHOUT PRAISE OR BLAME‚ÄÎUSING A POLITICAL FORMULA, EUROPE‚ÄÔS DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT: BEHIND ALL THE MORAL AND POLITICAL FOREGROUNDS TO WHICH SUCH FORMULAS POINT, A TREMENDOUS PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS IS TAKING PLACE AND GAINING MOMENTUM. THE EUROPEANS ARE BECOMING MORE SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER; THEY BECOME MORE AND MORE DETACHED FROM THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH RACES ORIGINATE THAT ARE TIED TO SOME CLIMATE OR CLASS; THEY BECOME INCREASINGLY INDEPENDENT OF ANY DETERMINATE MILIEU THAT WOULD LIKE TO INSCRIBE ITSELF FOR CENTURIES IN BODY AND SOUL WITH THE SAME DEMANDS. THUS AN ESSENTIALLY SUPRA-NATIONAL AND NOMADIC TYPE OF MAN IS GRADUALLY COMING UP, A TYPE THAT POSSESSES, PHYSIOLOGICALLY SPEAKING, A MAXIMUM OF THE ART AND POWER OF ADAPTATION AS ITS TYPICAL DISTINCTION.

THE TEMPO OF THIS PROCESS OF THE ‚ÄÚEVOLVING EUROPEAN‚ÄÙ MAY BE RETARDED BY GREAT RELAPSES, BUT PERHAPS IT WILL GAIN IN VEHEMENCE AND PROFUNDITY AND GROW JUST ON THEIR ACCOUNT: THE STILL RAGING STORM AND STRESS OF ‚ÄÚNATIONAL FEELING‚ÄÙ BELONGS HERE, ALSO THAT ANARCHISM WHICH IS JUST NOW COMING UP. BUT THIS PROCESS WILL PROBABLY LEAD TO RESULTS WHICH WOULD SEEM TO BE LEAST EXPECTED BY THOSE WHO NAIVELY PROMOTE AND PRAISE IT, THE APOSTLES OF ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS.‚ÄÙ THE VERY SAME NEW CONDITIONS THAT WILL ON THE AVERAGE LEAD TO THE LEVELING AND MEDIOCRITIZATION OF MAN‚ÄÎTO A USEFUL, INDUSTRIOUS, HANDY, MULTI-PURPOSE HERD ANIMAL‚ÄÎARE LIKELY IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE TO GIVE BIRTH TO EXCEPTIONAL HUMAN BEINGS OF THE MOST DANGEROUS AND ATTRACTIVE QUALITY.

TO BE SURE, THAT POWER OF ADAPTATION WHICH KEEPS TRYING OUT CHANGING CONDITIONS AND BEGINS SOME NEW WORK WITH EVERY GENERATION, ALMOST WITH EVERY DECADE, DOES NOT MAKE POSSIBLE THE POWERFULNESS OF THE TYPE, AND THE OVER-ALL IMPRESSION OF SUCH FUTURE EUROPEANS WILL PROBABLY BE THAT OF MANIFOLD GARRULOUS WORKERS WHO WILL BE POOR IN WILL, EXTREMELY EMPLOYABLE, AND AS MUCH IN NEED OF A MASTER AND COMMANDER AS OF THEIR DAILY BREAD. BUT WHILE THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF EUROPE LEADS TO THE PRODUCTION OF A TYPE THAT IS PREPARED FOR SLAVERY IN THE SUBTLEST SENSE, IN SINGLE, EXCEPTIONAL CASES THE STRONG HUMAN BEING WILL HAVE TO TURN OUT STRONGER AND RICHER THAN PERHAPS EVER BEFORE‚ÄÎTHANKS TO THE ABSENCE OF PREJUDICE FROM HIS TRAINING, THANKS TO THE TREMENDOUS MANIFOLDNESS OF PRACTICE, ART, AND MASK. I MEANT TO SAY: THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF EUROPE IS AT THE SAME TIME AN INVOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT FOR THE CULTIVATION OF TYRANTS‚ÄÎTAKING THAT WORD IN EVERY SENSE, INCLUDING THE MOST SPIRITUAL.

THERE WAS A TIME WHEN IT WAS CUSTOMARY TO ATTRIBUTE ‚ÄÚPROFUNDITY‚ÄÙ TO THE GERMANS, AS A DISTINCTION. NOW THAT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL TYPE OF THE NEW GERMANISM LUSTS AFTER UTTERLY DIFFERENT HONORS AND PERHAPS MISSES ‚ÄÚPLUCK‚ÄÙ IN EVERYTHING PROFOUND, SOME DOUBT MAY ALMOST BE TIMELY AND PATRIOTIC AS TO WHETHER THAT FORMER PRAISE WAS NOT BASED ON SELF-DECEPTION‚ÄÎIN SHORT, WHETHER GERMAN PROFUNDITY IS NOT AT BOTTOM SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND WORSE, AND SOMETHING THAT, THANK GOD, ONE IS ABOUT TO SHAKE OFF SUCCESSFULLY. LET US MAKE THE ATTEMPT TO RELEARN ABOUT GERMAN PROFUNDITY: NOTHING MORE IS NEEDED FOR THIS THAN A LITTLE VIVISECTION OF THE GERMAN SOUL.

THE GERMAN SOUL IS ABOVE ALL MANIFOLD, OF DIVERSE ORIGINS, MORE PUT TOGETHER AND SUPERIMPOSED THAN ACTUALLY BUILT: THAT IS DUE TO WHERE IT COMES FROM. A GERMAN WHO WOULD MAKE BOLD TO SAY, ‚ÄÚTWO SOULS, ALAS, ARE DWELLING IN MY BREAST,‚ÄÙ 4 WOULD VIOLATE THE TRUTH RATHER GROSSLY OR, MORE PRECISELY, WOULD FALL SHORT OF THE TRUTH BY A GOOD MANY SOULS. AS A PEOPLE OF THE MOST MONSTROUS MIXTURE AND MEDLEY OF RACES, PERHAPS EVEN WITH A PREPONDERANCE OF THE PRE-ARYAN ELEMENT, AS ‚ÄÚPEOPLE OF THE MIDDLE‚ÄÙ IN EVERY SENSE, THE GERMANS ARE MORE INCOMPREHENSIBLE, COMPREHENSIVE, CONTRADICTORY, UNKNOWN, INCALCULABLE, SURPRISING, EVEN FRIGHTENING THAN OTHER PEOPLE ARE TO THEMSELVES: THEY ELUDE DEFINITION AND WOULD BE ON THAT ACCOUNT ALONE THE DESPAIR OF THE FRENCH.

IT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE GERMANS THAT THE QUESTION, ‚ÄÚWHAT IS GERMAN?‚ÄÙ NEVER DIES OUT AMONG THEM. KOTZEBUE SURELY KNEW HIS GERMANS WELL ENOUGH: ‚ÄÚWE HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED!‚ÄÙ THEY JUBILATED‚ÄÎBUT SAND, TOO, THOUGHT HE KNEW THEM.5 JEAN PAUL6 KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING WHEN HE DECLARED HIMSELF WRATHFULLY AGAINST FICHTE‚ÄÔS MENDACIOUS BUT PATRIOTIC FLATTERIES AND EXAGGERATIONS‚ÄÎBUT IT IS PROBABLE THAT GOETHE DID NOT THINK ABOUT THE GERMANS AS JEAN PAUL DID, ALTHOUGH HE CONSIDERED HIM RIGHT ABOUT FICHTE. WHAT DID GOETHE REALLY THINK ABOUT THE GERMANS?

BUT THERE WERE MANY THINGS AROUND HIM ABOUT WHICH HE NEVER SPOKE CLEARLY, AND HIS LIFE LONG HE WAS A MASTER OF SUBTLE SILENCE‚ÄÎHE PROBABLY HAD GOOD REASONS FOR THAT. WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT IT WAS NOT ‚ÄÚTHE WARS OF LIBERATION‚ÄÙ 7 THAT MADE HIM LOOK UP MORE CHEERFULLY, ANY MORE THAN THE FRENCH REVOLUTION; THE EVENT ON WHOSE ACCOUNT HE RETHOUGHT HIS FAUST, INDEED THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MAN, WAS THE APPEARANCE OF NAPOLEON. THERE ARE WORDS OF GOETHE IN WHICH HE DEPRECATES WITH IMPATIENT HARDNESS, AS IF HE BELONGED TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY, WHAT THE GERMANS TAKE PRIDE IN: THE CELEBRATED GERMAN GEM√ºT8 HE ONCE DEFINED AS ‚ÄÚINDULGENCE TOWARD THE WEAKNESSES OF OTHERS AS WELL AS ONE‚ÄÔS OWN.‚ÄÙ WAS HE WRONG IN THAT? IT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE GERMANS THAT ONE IS RARELY COMPLETELY WRONG ABOUT THEM.

THE GERMAN SOUL HAS ITS PASSAGEWAYS AND INTER-PASSAGEWAYS; THERE ARE CAVES, HIDEOUTS, AND DUNGEONS IN IT; ITS DISORDER HAS A GOOD DEAL OF THE ATTRACTION OF THE MYSTERIOUS; THE GERMAN IS AN EXPERT ON SECRET PATHS TO CHAOS. AND JUST AS EVERYTHING LOVES ITS SIMILE, THE GERMAN LOVES CLOUDS AND EVERYTHING THAT IS UNCLEAR, BECOMING, TWILIT, DAMP, AND OVERCAST: WHATEVER IS IN ANY WAY UNCERTAIN, UNFORMED, BLURRED, GROWING, HE FEELS TO BE ‚ÄÚPROFOUND.‚ÄÙ THE GERMAN HIMSELF IS NOT, HE BECOMES, HE ‚ÄÚDEVELOPS.‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚDEVELOPMENT‚ÄÙ IS THEREFORE THE TRULY GERMAN FIND AND HIT IN THE GREAT REALM OF PHILOSOPHICAL FORMULAS‚ÄÎA GOVERNING CONCEPT THAT, UNITED WITH GERMAN BEER AND GERMAN MUSIC, IS AT WORK TRYING TO GERMANIZE THE WHOLE OF EUROPE.

FOREIGNERS STAND AMAZED AND FASCINATED BEFORE THE RIDDLES POSED FOR THEM BY THE CONTRADICTORY NATURE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GERMAN SOUL (BROUGHT INTO A SYSTEM BY HEGEL AND FINALLY SET TO MUSIC BY RICHARD WAGNER). ‚ÄÚGOOD-NATURED AND VICIOUS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎSUCH A CONJUNCTION, PREPOSTEROUS IN RELATION TO ANY OTHER PEOPLE, IS UNFORTUNATELY JUSTIFIED ALL TOO OFTEN IN GERMANY: LET ANYONE LIVE FOR A WHILE AMONG SWABIANS! THE PONDEROUSNESS OF THE GERMAN SCHOLAR, HIS SOCIAL BAD TASTE, GETS ALONG ALARMINGLY WELL WITH AN INNER ROPE-DANCING AND EASY BOLDNESS WHICH HAS TAUGHT ALL THE GODS WHAT FEAR IS. WHOEVER WANTS A DEMONSTRATION OF THE ‚ÄÚGERMAN SOUL‚ÄÙ AD OCULOS9 SHOULD MERELY LOOK INTO GERMAN TASTE, INTO GERMAN ARTS AND CUSTOMS: WHAT BOORISH INDIFFERENCE TO ‚ÄÚTASTE‚ÄÙ! HOW THE NOBLEST STANDS RIGHT NEXT TO THE MEANEST! HOW DISORDERLY AND RICH THIS WHOLE PSYCHIC HOUSEHOLD IS! THE GERMAN DRAGS HIS SOUL ALONG: WHATEVER HE EXPERIENCES HE DRAGS. HE DIGESTS HIS EVENTS BADLY, HE NEVER GETS ‚ÄÚDONE‚ÄÙ WITH THEM; GERMAN PROFUNDITY IS OFTEN MERELY A HARD AND SLUGGISH ‚ÄÚDIGESTION.‚ÄÙ AND JUST AS ALL CHRONIC INVALIDS, ALL DYSPEPTICS, LOVE COMFORT, GERMANS LOVE ‚ÄÚOPENNESS‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚBIEDERKEIT‚ÄÙ: HOW COMFORTABLE IT IS TO BE OPEN AND ‚ÄÚBIEDER‚ÄÙ!10

PERHAPS THE GERMAN OF TODAY KNOWS NO MORE DANGEROUS AND SUCCESSFUL DISGUISE THAN THIS CONFIDING, ACCOMMODATING, CARDS-ON-THE-TABLE MANNER OF GERMAN HONESTY: THIS IS HIS TRUE MEPHISTOPHELES-ART; WITH THAT HE CAN ‚ÄÚSTILL GO FAR.‚ÄÙ THE GERMAN LETS HIMSELF GO WHILE MAKING FAITHFUL BLUE, EMPTY, GERMAN EYES‚ÄÎAND IMMEDIATELY FOREIGNERS CONFOUND HIM WITH HIS DRESSING GOWN.

I MEANT TO SAY: WHATEVER ‚ÄÚGERMAN PROFUNDITY‚ÄÙ MAY BE‚ÄÎWHEN WE ARE ENTIRELY AMONG OURSELVES, PERHAPS WE PERMIT OURSELVES TO LAUGH AT IT?‚ÄÎWE SHALL DO WELL TO HOLD ITS SEMBLANCE AND GOOD NAME IN HONOR IN THE FUTURE, TOO, AND NOT TO TRADE OUR OLD REPUTATION AS A PEOPLE OF PROFUNDITY TOO CHEAPLY FOR PRUSSIAN ‚ÄÚPLUCK‚ÄÙ AND BERLIN WIT AND SAND.11 IT IS CLEVER FOR A PEOPLE TO MAKE AND LET ITSELF BE CONSIDERED PROFOUND, AWKWARD, GOOD-NATURED, HONEST, AND NOT CLEVER: IT MIGHT EVEN BE‚ÄÎPROFOUND. FINALLY, ONE SHOULD LIVE UP TO ONE‚ÄÔS NAME: IT IS NOT FOR NOTHING THAT ONE IS CALLED THE ‚ÄÚTIUSCHE‚ÄÙ VOLK, THE T√§USCHE-VOLK, DECEIVER PEOPLE.12‚ÄÎ

THE ‚ÄÚGOOD OLD TIME‚ÄÙ IS GONE, IN MOZART WE HEAR ITS SWAN SONG. HOW FORTUNATE WE ARE THAT HIS ROCOCO STILL SPEAKS TO US, THAT HIS ‚ÄÚGOOD COMPANY,‚ÄÙ HIS TENDER ENTHUSIASMS, HIS CHILDLIKE DELIGHT IN CURLICUES AND CHINESE TOUCHES, HIS COURTESY OF THE HEART, HIS LONGING FOR THE GRACEFUL, THOSE IN LOVE, THOSE DANCING, THOSE EASILY MOVED TO TEARS, HIS FAITH IN THE SOUTH, MAY STILL APPEAL TO SOME RESIDUE IN US. ALAS, SOME DAY ALL THIS WILL BE GONE‚ÄÎBUT WHO MAY DOUBT THAT THE UNDERSTANDING AND TASTE FOR BEETHOVEN WILL GO LONG BEFORE THAT! BEETHOVEN WAS AFTER ALL MERELY THE FINAL CHORD OF TRANSITION IN STYLE, A STYLE BREAK, AND NOT, LIKE MOZART, THE LAST CHORD OF A CENTURIES-OLD GREAT EUROPEAN TASTE.

BEETHOVEN IS THE INTERLUDE OF A MELLOW OLD SOUL THAT CONSTANTLY BREAKS AND AN OVER-YOUNG FUTURE SOUL THAT CONSTANTLY COMES; ON HIS MUSIC LIES THAT TWILIGHT OF ETERNAL LOSING AND ETERNAL EXTRAVAGANT HOPING‚ÄÎTHE SAME LIGHT IN WHICH EUROPE WAS BATHED WHEN IT DREAMED WITH ROUSSEAU, DANCED AROUND THE FREEDOM TREE OF THE REVOLUTION, AND FINALLY ALMOST WORSHIPED BEFORE NAPOLEON. BUT HOW QUICKLY THIS FEELING PALES NOW; HOW DIFFICULT IS MERE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS FEELING EVEN TODAY‚ÄÎHOW STRANGE TO OUR EARS SOUNDS THE LANGUAGE OF ROUSSEAU, SCHILLER, SHELLEY, BYRON, IN WHOM, TAKEN TOGETHER, THE SAME FATE OF EUROPE FOUND ITS WAY INTO WORDS THAT IN BEETHOVEN KNEW HOW TO SING!

WHATEVER GERMAN MUSIC CAME AFTER THAT BELONGS TO ROMANTICISM, A MOVEMENT THAT WAS, VIEWED HISTORICALLY, STILL BRIEFER, STILL MORE FLEETING, STILL MORE SUPERFICIAL THAN THAT GREAT ENTR‚ÄÔACTE, THAT TRANSITION OF EUROPE FROM ROUSSEAU TO NAPOLEON AND TO THE RISE OF DEMOCRACY. WEBER: BUT WHAT ARE FREISCH√ºTZ AND OBERON TO US TODAY! OR MARSCHNER‚ÄÔS HANS HEILING AND VAMPYR! OR EVEN WAGNER‚ÄÔS TANNH√§USER. THAT IS MUSIC THAT HAS DIED AWAY THOUGH IT IS NOT YET FORGOTTEN. ALL THIS MUSIC OF ROMANTICISM, MOREOVER, WAS NOT NOBLE ENOUGH TO REMAIN VALID ANYWHERE EXCEPT IN THE THEATER AND BEFORE CROWDS; IT WAS FROM THE START SECOND-RATE MUSIC THAT WAS NOT CONSIDERED SERIOUSLY BY GENUINE MUSICIANS.

IT IS DIFFERENT WITH FELIX MENDELSSOHN, THAT HALCYON MASTER WHO, ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LIGHTER, PURER, MORE ENCHANTED SOUL, WAS HONORED QUICKLY AND JUST AS QUICKLY FORGOTTEN: AS THE BEAUTIFUL INTERMEZZO OF GERMAN MUSIC. BUT AS FOR ROBERT SCHUMANN, WHO WAS VERY SERIOUS AND ALSO WAS TAKEN SERIOUSLY FROM THE START‚ÄÎHE WAS THE LAST TO FOUND A SCHOOL‚ÄÎIS IT NOT CONSIDERED A GOOD FORTUNE AMONG US TODAY, A RELIEF, A LIBERATION, THAT THIS SCHUMANN ROMANTICISM HAS BEEN OVERCOME?

SCHUMANN, FLEEING INTO THE ‚ÄÚSAXON SWITZERLAND‚ÄÙ 13 OF HIS SOUL, HALF LIKE WERTHER, HALF LIKE JEAN PAUL, CERTAINLY NOT LIKE BEETHOVEN, CERTAINLY NOT LIKE BYRON‚ÄÎHIS MANFRED MUSIC IS A MISTAKE AND MISUNDERSTANDING TO THE POINT OF AN INJUSTICE‚ÄÎSCHUMANN WITH HIS TASTE WHICH WAS BASICALLY A SMALL TASTE (NAMELY, A DANGEROUS PROPENSITY, DOUBLY DANGEROUS AMONG GERMANS, FOR QUIET LYRICISM AND SOTTISHNESS OF FEELING), CONSTANTLY WALKING OFF TO WITHDRAW SHYLY AND RETIRE, A NOBLE TENDER-HEART WHO WALLOWED IN ALL SORTS OF ANONYMOUS BLISS AND WOE, A KIND OF GIRL AND NOLI ME TANGERE14 FROM THE START: THIS SCHUMANN WAS ALREADY A MERELY GERMAN EVENT IN MUSIC, NO LONGER A EUROPEAN ONE, AS BEETHOVEN WAS AND, TO A STILL GREATER EXTENT, MOZART. WITH HIM GERMAN MUSIC WAS THREATENED BY ITS GREATEST DANGER: LOSING THE VOICE FOR THE SOUL OF EUROPE AND DESCENDING TO MERE FATHERLANDISHNESS.

WHAT TORTURE BOOKS WRITTEN IN GERMAN ARE FOR ANYONE WHO HAS A THIRD EAR! HOW VEXED ONE STANDS BEFORE THE SLOWLY REVOLVING SWAMP OF SOUNDS THAT DO NOT SOUND LIKE ANYTHING AND RHYTHMS THAT DO NOT DANCE, CALLED A ‚ÄÚBOOK‚ÄÙ AMONG GERMANS! YET WORSE IS THE GERMAN WHO READS BOOKS! HOW LAZILY, HOW RELUCTANTLY, HOW BADLY HE READS! HOW MANY GERMANS KNOW, AND DEMAND OF THEMSELVES THAT THEY SHOULD KNOW, THAT THERE IS ART IN EVERY GOOD SENTENCE‚ÄÎART THAT MUST BE FIGURED OUT IF THE SENTENCE IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD! A MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT ITS TEMPO, FOR EXAMPLE‚ÄÎAND THE SENTENCE ITSELF IS MISUNDERSTOOD.

THAT ONE MUST NOT BE IN DOUBT ABOUT THE RHYTHMICALLY DECISIVE SYLLABLES, THAT ONE EXPERIENCES THE BREAK WITH ANY EXCESSIVELY SEVERE SYMMETRY AS DELIBERATE AND ATTRACTIVE, THAT ONE LENDS A SUBTLE AND PATIENT EAR TO EVERY STACCATO15 AND EVERY RUBATO,16 THAT ONE FIGURES OUT THE MEANING IN THE SEQUENCE OF VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS AND HOW DELICATELY AND RICHLY THEY CAN BE COLORED AND CHANGE COLORS AS THEY FOLLOW EACH OTHER‚ÄÎWHO AMONG BOOK-READING GERMANS HAS ENOUGH GOOD WILL TO ACKNOWLEDGE SUCH DUTIES AND DEMANDS AND TO LISTEN TO THAT MUCH ART AND PURPOSE IN LANGUAGE? IN THE END ONE SIMPLY DOES NOT HAVE ‚ÄÚTHE EAR FOR THAT;‚ÄÙ AND THUS THE STRONGEST CONTRASTS OF STYLE GO UNHEARD, AND THE SUBTLEST ARTISTRY IS. WASTED AS ON THE DEAF.

THESE WERE MY THOUGHTS WHEN I NOTICED HOW CLUMSILY AND UN-DISCERNINGLY TWO MASTERS IN THE ART OF PROSE WERE CONFOUNDED‚ÄÎONE WHOSE WORDS DROP HESITANTLY AND COLDLY, AS FROM THE CEILING OF A DAMP CAVE‚ÄÎHE COUNTS ON THEIR DULL SOUND AND RESONANCE‚ÄÎAND ANOTHER WHO HANDLES HIS LANGUAGE LIKE A FLEXIBLE RAPIER, FEELING FROM HIS ARM DOWN TO HIS TOES THE DANGEROUS DELIGHT OF THE QUIVERING, OVER-SHARP BLADE THAT DESIRES TO BITE, HISS, CUT.17‚ÄÎ

HOW LITTLE GERMAN STYLE HAS TO DO WITH SOUND AND THE EARS IS SHOWN BY THE FACT THAT PRECISELY OUR GOOD MUSICIANS WRITE BADLY. THE GERMAN DOES NOT READ ALOUD, NOT FOR THE EAR BUT ONLY WITH THE EYE: MEANWHILE HIS EARS ARE PUT AWAY IN A DRAWER. IN ANTIQUITY MEN READ‚ÄÎWHEN THEY DID READ, WHICH HAPPENED RARELY ENOUGH‚ÄÎTO THEMSELVES, ALOUD, WITH A RESOUNDING VOICE; ONE WAS SURPRISED WHEN ANYONE READ QUIETLY, AND SECRETLY ASKED ONESELF FOR THE REASONS. WITH A RESOUNDING VOICE: THAT MEANS, WITH ALL THE CRESCENDOS, INFLECTIONS, AND REVERSALS OF TONE AND CHANGES IN TEMPO IN WHICH THE ANCIENT PUBLIC WORLD TOOK DELIGHT.

THE LAWS OF WRITTEN STYLE WERE THEN THE SAME AS THOSE FOR SPOKEN STYLE; AND THESE LAWS DEPENDED PARTLY ON THE AMAZING DEVELOPMENT AND THE REFINED REQUIREMENTS OF EAR AND LARYNX, PARTLY ON THE STRENGTH, PERSEVERANCE, AND POWER OF ANCIENT LUNGS. A PERIOD IN THE CLASSICAL SENSE IS ABOVE ALL A PHYSIOLOGICAL UNIT, INSOFAR AS IT IS HELD TOGETHER BY A SINGLE BREATH. SUCH PERIODS AS ARE FOUND IN DEMOSTHENES AND CICERO, SWELLING TWICE AND COMING DOWN TWICE, ALL WITHIN A SINGLE BREATH, ARE DELIGHTS FOR THE MEN OF ANTIQUITY WHO, FROM THEIR OWN TRAINING, KNEW HOW TO ESTEEM THEIR VIRTUE AND HOW RARE AND DIFFICULT WAS THE DELIVERY OF SUCH A PERIOD. WE REALLY HAVE NO RIGHT TO THE GREAT PERIOD, WE WHO ARE MODERN AND IN EVERY SENSE SHORT OF BREATH.19

ALL OF THESE ANCIENTS WERE AFTER ALL THEMSELVES DILETTANTES IN RHETORIC, HENCE CONNOISSEURS, HENCE CRITICS AND THUS DROVE THEIR RHETORICIANS TO EXTREMES; JUST AS IN THE LAST CENTURY, WHEN ALL ITALIANS AND ITALIENNES KNEW HOW TO SING, VIRTUOSITY IN SINGING (AND WITH THAT ALSO THE ART OF MELODY) REACHED ITS CLIMAX AMONG THEM. IN GERMANY, HOWEVER, THERE REALLY WAS (UNTIL QUITE RECENTLY, WHEN A KIND OF PLATFORM ELOQUENCE BEGAN SHYLY AND CLUMSILY ENOUGH TO FLAP ITS YOUNG WINGS) ONLY A SINGLE SPECIES OF PUBLIC AND ROUGHLY ARTFUL RHETORIC: THAT FROM THE PULPIT.

IN GERMANY THE PREACHER ALONE KNEW WHAT A SYLLABLE WEIGHS, OR A WORD, AND HOW A SENTENCE STRIKES, LEAPS, PLUNGES, RUNS, RUNS OUT; HE ALONE HAD A CONSCIENCE IN HIS EARS, OFTEN ENOUGH A BAD CONSCIENCE; FOR THERE IS NO LACK OF REASONS WHY GERMANS RARELY ATTAIN PROFICIENCY IN RHETORIC, AND ALMOST ALWAYS TOO LATE. THE MASTERPIECE OF GERMAN PROSE IS THEREFORE, FAIRLY ENOUGH, THE MASTERPIECE OF ITS GREATEST PREACHER: THE BIBLE HAS SO FAR BEEN THE BEST GERMAN BOOK. COMPARED WITH LUTHER‚ÄÔS BIBLE, ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE IS MERE ‚ÄÚLITERATURE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎSOMETHING THAT DID NOT GROW IN GERMANY AND THEREFORE ALSO DID NOT GROW AND DOES NOT GROW INTO GERMAN HEARTS‚ÄÎAS THE BIBLE DID.

THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF GENIUS: ONE WHICH ABOVE ALL BEGETS AND WANTS TO BEGET, AND ANOTHER WHICH PREFERS BEING FERTILIZED AND GIVING BIRTH. JUST SO, THERE ARE AMONG PEOPLES OF GENIUS THOSE TO WHOM THE WOMAN‚ÄÔS PROBLEM OF PREGNANCY AND THE SECRET TASK OF FORMING, MATURING, AND PERFECTING HAS BEEN ALLOTTED‚ÄÎTHE GREEKS, FOR EXAMPLE, WERE A PEOPLE OF THIS TYPE; ALSO THE FRENCH‚ÄÎAND OTHERS WHO MUST FERTILIZE AND BECOME THE CAUSES OF NEW ORDERS OF LIFE‚ÄÎLIKE THE JEWS,20 THE ROMANS, AND, ASKING THIS IN ALL MODESTY, THE GERMANS? PEOPLES, TORMENTED AND ENCHANTED BY UNKNOWN FEVERS AND IRRESISTIBLY PRESSED BEYOND THEMSELVES, IN LOVE AND LUSTING AFTER FOREIGN RACES (AFTER THOSE WHO LIKE ‚ÄÚBEING FERTILIZED‚ÄÙ), AND AT THE SAME TIME DOMINEERING LIKE ALL THAT KNOWS ITSELF TO BE FULL OF CREATIVE POWERS AND HENCE ‚ÄÚBY THE GRACE OF GOD.‚ÄÙ THESE TWO TYPES OF GENIUS SEEK EACH OTHER, LIKE MAN AND WOMAN; BUT THEY ALSO MISUNDERSTAND EACH OTHER‚ÄÎLIKE MAN AND WOMAN.

WHAT EUROPE OWES TO THE JEWS? MANY THINGS, GOOD AND BAD, AND ABOVE ALL ONE THING THAT IS BOTH OF THE BEST AND OF THE WORST: THE GRAND STYLE IN MORALITY, THE TERRIBLENESS AND MAJESTY OF INFINITE DEMANDS, INFINITE MEANINGS, THE WHOLE ROMANTICISM AND SUBLIMITY OF MORAL QUESTIONABILITIES‚ÄÎAND HENCE PRECISELY THE MOST ATTRACTIVE, CAPTIOUS, AND CHOICEST PART OF THOSE PLAYS OF COLOR AND SEDUCTIONS TO LIFE IN WHOSE AFTERGLOW THE SKY OF OUR EUROPEAN CULTURE, ITS EVENING SKY, IS BURNING NOW‚ÄÎPERHAPS BURNING ITSELF OUT. WE ARTISTS AMONG THE SPECTATORS AND PHILOSOPHERS ARE‚ÄÎGRATEFUL FOR THIS TO THE JEWS.21

IT MUST BE TAKEN INTO THE BARGAIN IF ALL SORTS OF CLOUDS AND DISTURBANCES‚ÄÎIN BRIEF, LITTLE ATTACKS OF HEBETATION‚ÄÎPASS OVER THE SPIRIT OF A PEOPLE THAT IS SUFFERING, AND WANTS TO SUFFER, OF NATIONALISTIC NERVE FEVER AND POLITICAL AMBITION. EXAMPLES AMONG THE GERMANS TODAY INCLUDE NOW THE ANTI-FRENCH STUPIDITY, NOW THE ANTI-JEWISH, NOW THE ANTI-POLISH, NOW THE CHRISTIAN-ROMANTIC, NOW THE WAGNERIAN, NOW THE TEUTONIC, NOW THE PRUSSIAN (JUST LOOK AT THE WRETCHED HISTORIANS, THESE SYBELS AND TREITSCHKES22 AND THEIR THICKLY BANDAGED HEADS!) AND WHATEVER OTHER NAMES THESE LITTLE NOTIFICATIONS23 OF THE GERMAN SPIRIT AND CONSCIENCE MAY HAVE. FORGIVE ME, FOR DURING A BRIEF DARING SOJOURN IN VERY INFECTED TERRITORY I, TOO, DID NOT ALTOGETHER ESCAPE THIS DISEASE AND BEGAN LIKE EVERYONE ELSE TO DEVELOP NOTIONS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE NONE OF MY BUSINESS: THE FIRST SIGN OF THE POLITICAL INFECTION. FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT THE JEWS: ONLY LISTEN!

I HAVE NOT MET A GERMAN YET WHO WAS WELL DISPOSED TOWARD THE JEWS; AND HOWEVER UNCONDITIONALLY ALL THE CAUTIOUS AND POLITICALLY-MINDED REPUDIATED REAL ANTI-SEMITISM,24 EVEN THIS CAUTION AND POLICY ARE NOT DIRECTED AGAINST THE SPECIES OF THIS FEELING ITSELF BUT ONLY AGAINST ITS DANGEROUS IMMODERATION, ESPECIALLY AGAINST THE INSIPID AND SHAMEFUL EXPRESSION OF THIS IMMODERATE FEELING‚ÄÎABOUT THIS, ONE SHOULD NOT DECEIVE ONESELF. THAT GERMANY HAS AMPLY ENOUGH JEWS, THAT THE GERMAN STOMACH, THE GERMAN BLOOD HAS TROUBLE (AND WILL STILL HAVE TROUBLE FOR A LONG TIME) DIGESTING EVEN THIS QUANTUM OF ‚ÄÚJEW‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAS THE ITALIANS, FRENCH, AND ENGLISH HAVE DONE, HAVING A STRONGER DIGESTIVE SYSTEM‚ÄÎTHAT IS THE CLEAR TESTIMONY AND LANGUAGE OF A GENERAL INSTINCT TO WHICH ONE MUST LISTEN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHICH ONE MUST ACT. ‚ÄÚADMIT NO MORE NEW JEWS! AND ESPECIALLY CLOSE THE DOORS TO THE EAST (ALSO TO AUSTRIA)!‚ÄÙ THUS COMMANDS THE INSTINCT OF A PEOPLE WHOSE TYPE IS STILL WEAK AND INDEFINITE, SO IT COULD EASILY BE BLURRED OR EXTINGUISHED BY A STRONGER RACE. THE JEWS, HOWEVER, ARE BEYOND ANY DOUBT THE STRONGEST, TOUGHEST, AND PUREST RACE NOW LIVING IN EUROPE; THEY KNOW HOW TO PREVAIL EVEN UNDER THE WORST CONDITIONS (EVEN BETTER THAN UNDER FAVORABLE CONDITIONS), BY MEANS OF VIRTUES THAT TODAY ONE WOULD LIKE TO MARK AS VICES‚ÄÎTHANKS ABOVE ALL TO A RESOLUTE FAITH THAT NEED NOT BE ASHAMED BEFORE ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS;‚ÄÙ THEY CHANGE, WHEN THEY CHANGE, ALWAYS ONLY AS THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE MAKES ITS CONQUESTS‚ÄÎBEING AN EMPIRE THAT HAS TIME AND IS NOT OF YESTERDAY‚ÄÎNAMELY, ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLE, ‚ÄÚAS SLOWLY AS POSSIBLE.‚ÄÙ

A THINKER WHO HAS THE DEVELOPMENT OF EUROPE ON HIS CONSCIENCE WILL, IN ALL HIS PROJECTS FOR THIS FUTURE, TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE JEWS AS WELL AS THE RUSSIANS AS THE PROVISIONALLY SUREST AND MOST PROBABLE FACTORS IN THE GREAT PLAY AND FIGHT OF FORCES. WHAT IS CALLED A ‚ÄÚNATION‚ÄÙ IN EUROPE TODAY, AND IS REALLY RATHER A RES FACTA THAN A RES NATA (AND OCCASIONALLY CAN HARDLY BE TOLD FROM A RES FICTA ET PICTA)25 IS IN ANY CASE SOMETHING EVOLVING, YOUNG, AND EASILY CHANGED, NOT YET A RACE, LET ALONE SUCH AN AERE PERENNIUS26 AS THE JEWISH TYPE: THESE ‚ÄÚNATIONS‚ÄÙ REALLY SHOULD CAREFULLY AVOID EVERY HOTHEADED RIVALRY AND HOSTILITY! THAT THE JEWS, IF THEY WANTED IT‚ÄÎOR IF THEY WERE FORCED INTO IT, WHICH SEEMS TO BE WHAT THE ANTI-SEMITES WANT‚ÄÎCOULD EVEN NOW HAVE PREPONDERANCE, INDEED QUITE LITERALLY MASTERY OVER EUROPE, THAT IS CERTAIN; THAT THEY ARE NOT WORKING AND PLANNING FOR THAT IS EQUALLY CERTAIN.

MEANWHILE THEY WANT AND WISH RATHER, EVEN WITH SOME IMPORTUNITY, TO BE ABSORBED AND ASSIMILATED BY EUROPE; THEY LONG TO BE FIXED, PERMITTED, RESPECTED SOMEWHERE AT LONG LAST, PUTTING AN END TO THE NOMADS‚ÄÔ LIFE, TO THE ‚ÄÚWANDERING JEW;‚ÄÙ AND THIS BENT AND IMPULSE (WHICH MAY EVEN EXPRESS AN ATTENUATION OF THE JEWISH INSTINCTS) SHOULD BE NOTED WELL AND ACCOMMODATED: TO THAT END IT MIGHT BE USEFUL AND FAIR TO EXPEL THE ANTI-SEMITIC SCREAMERS FROM THE COUNTRY.27 ACCOMMODATED WITH ALL CAUTION, WITH SELECTION; APPROXIMATELY AS THE ENGLISH NOBILITY DOES. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE STRONGER AND ALREADY MORE CLEARLY DEFINED TYPES OF THE NEW GERMANISM CAN ENTER INTO RELATIONS WITH THEM WITH THE LEAST HESITATION; FOR EXAMPLE, OFFICERS OF THE NOBILITY FROM THE MARCH BRANDENBURG:28 IT WOULD BE INTERESTING IN MANY WAYS TO SEE WHETHER THE HEREDITARY ART OF COMMANDING AND OBEYING‚ÄÎIN BOTH OF THESE, THE LAND JUST NAMED IS CLASSICAL TODAY‚ÄÎCOULD NOT BE ENRICHED WITH29 THE GENIUS OF MONEY AND PATIENCE (AND ABOVE ALL A LITTLE SPIRITUALITY, WHICH IS UTTERLY LACKING AMONG THESE OFFICERS). BUT HERE IT IS PROPER TO BREAK OFF MY CHEERFUL GERMANOMANIA AND HOLIDAY ORATORY; FOR I AM BEGINNING TO TOUCH ON WHAT IS SERIOUS FOR ME, THE ‚ÄÚEUROPEAN PROBLEM‚ÄÙ AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THE CULTIVATION OF A NEW CASTE THAT WILL RULE EUROPE.

THEY ARE NO PHILOSOPHICAL RACE, THESE ENGLISHMEN: BACON SIGNIFIES AN ATTACK ON THE PHILOSOPHICAL SPIRIT; HOBBES, HUME, AND LOCKE A DEBASEMENT AND LOWERING OF THE VALUE OF THE CONCEPT OF ‚ÄÚPHILOSOPHY‚ÄÙ FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY. IT WAS AGAINST HUME THAT KANT AROSE, AND ROSE; IT WAS LOCKE OF WHOM SCHELLING SAID, UNDERSTANDABLY, ‚ÄÚJE M√©PRISE LOCKE‚ÄÙ;30 IN THEIR FIGHT AGAINST THE ENGLISH-MECHANISTIC DOLTIFICATION OF THE WORLD, HEGEL AND SCHOPENHAUER WERE OF ONE MIND (WITH GOETHE)‚ÄÎTHESE TWO HOSTILE BROTHER GENIUSES IN PHILOSOPHY WHO STROVE APART TOWARD OPPOSITE POLES OF THE GERMAN SPIRIT AND IN THE PROCESS WRONGED EACH OTHER AS ONLY BROTHERS WRONG EACH OTHER.31

WHAT WAS LACKING IN ENGLAND, AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN LACKING THERE, WAS KNOWN WELL ENOUGH TO THAT SEMI-ACTOR AND RHETORICIAN, THE INSIPID MUDDLEHEAD CARLYLE, WHO TRIED TO CONCEAL BEHIND PASSIONATE GRIMACES WHAT HE KNEW OF HIMSELF‚ÄÎNAMELY, WHAT WAS LACKING IN CARLYLE: REAL POWER OF SPIRITUALITY, REAL PROFUNDITY OF SPIRITUAL PERCEPTION; IN BRIEF, PHILOSOPHY.

IT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF SUCH AN UNPHILOSOPHICAL RACE THAT IT CLINGS FIRMLY TO CHRISTIANITY: THEY NEED ITS DISCIPLINE TO BECOME ‚ÄÚMORALIZED‚ÄÙ AND SOMEWHAT HUMANIZED. THE ENGLISH, BEING GLOOMIER, MORE SENSUAL, STRONGER IN WILL, AND MORE BRUTAL THAN THE GERMANS, ARE PRECISELY FOR THAT REASON MORE VULGAR, ALSO MORE PIOUS THAN THE GERMANS: THEY STAND MORE IN NEED OF CHRISTIANITY. FOR MORE SENSITIVE NOSTRILS EVEN THIS ENGLISH CHRISTIANITY STILL HAS A TYPICALLY ENGLISH ODOR OF SPLEEN AND ALCOHOLIC DISSIPATION AGAINST WHICH IT IS NEEDED FOR GOOD REASONS AS A REMEDY‚ÄÎTHE SUBTLER POISON AGAINST THE COARSER: A SUBTLER POISONING IS INDEED FOR CLUMSY PEOPLES SOME PROGRESS, A STEP TOWARD SPIRITUALIZATION. ENGLISH CLUMSINESS AND PEASANT SERIOUSNESS IS STILL DISGUISED MOST TOLERABLY‚ÄÎOR RATHER ELUCIDATED AND REINTERPRETED‚ÄÎBY THE LANGUAGE OF CHRISTIAN GESTURES AND BY PRAYERS AND SINGING OF PSALMS. AND FOR THOSE BRUTES OF SOTS AND RAKES WHO FORMERLY LEARNED HOW TO GRUNT MORALLY UNDER THE SWAY OF METHODISM AND MORE RECENTLY AGAIN AS A ‚ÄÚSALVATION ARMY,‚ÄÙ A PENITENTIAL SPASM MAY REALLY BE THE RELATIVELY HIGHEST ACHIEVEMENT OF ‚ÄÚHUMANITY‚ÄÙ TO WHICH THEY CAN BE RAISED: THAT MUCH MAY BE CONCEDED IN ALL FAIRNESS. BUT WHAT IS OFFENSIVE EVEN IN THE MOST HUMANE ENGLISHMAN IS HIS LACK OF MUSIC, SPEAKING METAPHORICALLY (BUT NOT ONLY METAPHORICALLY): IN THE MOVEMENTS OF HIS SOUL AND BODY HE HAS NO RHYTHM AND DANCE, INDEED NOT EVEN THE DESIRE FOR RHYTHM AND DANCE, FOR ‚ÄÚMUSIC.‚ÄÙ LISTEN TO HIM SPEAK; WATCH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ENGLISHWOMEN WALK‚ÄÎTHERE ARE NO MORE BEAUTIFUL DOVES AND SWANS IN ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD‚ÄÎFINALLY LISTEN TO THEM SING! BUT I AM ASKING TOO MUCH‚ÄÎ

THERE ARE TRUTHS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED BEST BY MEDIOCRE MINDS BECAUSE THEY ARE MOST CONGENIAL TO THEM; THERE ARE TRUTHS THAT HAVE CHARM AND SEDUCTIVE POWERS ONLY FOR MEDIOCRE SPIRITS: WE COME UP AGAINST THIS PERHAPS DISAGREEABLE PROPOSITION JUST NOW, SINCE THE SPIRIT OF RESPECTABLE BUT MEDIOCRE ENGLISHMEN‚ÄÎI NAME DARWIN, JOHN STUART MILL, AND HERBERT SPENCER‚ÄÎIS BEGINNING TO PREDOMINATE IN THE MIDDLE REGIONS OF EUROPEAN TASTE. INDEED, WHO WOULD DOUBT THAT IT IS USEFUL THAT SUCH SPIRITS SHOULD RULE AT TIMES? IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO SUPPOSE THAT THE SPIRITS OF A HIGH TYPE THAT SOAR ON THEIR OWN PATHS WOULD BE PARTICULARLY SKILLFUL AT DETERMINING AND COLLECTING MANY SMALL AND COMMON FACTS AND THEN DRAWING CONCLUSIONS FROM THEM: ON THE CONTRARY, BEING EXCEPTIONS, THEY ARE FROM THE START AT A DISADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO THE ‚ÄÚRULE.‚ÄÙ FINALLY, THEY HAVE MORE TO DO THAN MERELY TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE‚ÄÎNAMELY, TO BE SOMETHING NEW, TO SIGNIFY SOMETHING NEW, TO REPRESENT NEW VALUES. PERHAPS THE CHASM BETWEEN KNOW AND CAN IS GREATER, ALSO UNCANNIER, THAN PEOPLE SUPPOSE: THOSE WHO CAN DO THINGS IN THE GRAND STYLE, THE CREATIVE, MAY POSSIBLY HAVE TO BE LACKING IN KNOWLEDGE‚ÄÎWHILE, ON THE OTHER HAND, FOR SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES OF THE TYPE OF DARWIN‚ÄÔS A CERTAIN NARROWNESS, ARIDITY, AND INDUSTRIOUS DILIGENCE, SOMETHING ENGLISH IN SHORT, MAY NOT BE A BAD DISPOSITION.

FINALLY, WE SHOULD NOT FORGET THAT THE ENGLISH WITH THEIR PROFOUND NORMALITY HAVE ONCE BEFORE CAUSED AN OVER-ALL DEPRESSION OF THE EUROPEAN SPIRIT: WHAT PEOPLE CALL ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚTHE IDEAS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY‚ÄÙ OR ALSO ‚ÄÚFRENCH IDEAS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT, IN OTHER WORDS, AGAINST WHICH THE GERMAN SPIRIT HAS RISEN WITH A PROFOUND DISGUST‚ÄÎWAS OF ENGLISH ORIGIN; THERE IS NO DOUBT OF THAT. THE FRENCH HAVE MERELY BEEN APES AND MIMES OF THESE IDEAS; ALSO THEIR BEST SOLDIERS; UNFORTUNATELY, THEIR FIRST AND MOST THOROUGHGOING VICTIMS AS WELL: FOR OVER THIS DAMNABLE ANGLOMANIA OF ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS‚ÄÙ THE √¢ME FRAN√ßAISE32 HAS IN THE END BECOME SO THIN AND EMACIATED THAT TODAY ONE RECALLS HER SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES, HER PROFOUND AND PASSIONATE STRENGTH, AND HER INVENTIVE NOBILITY ALMOST WITH DISBELIEF. YET WE MUST HANG ON TO THIS PROPOSITION OF HISTORICAL FAIRNESS WITH OUR VERY TEETH, DEFENDING IT AGAINST MOMENTARY APPEARANCES: EUROPEAN NOBLESSE‚ÄÎOF FEELING, OF TASTE, OF MANNERS, TAKING THE WORD, IN SHORT, IN EVERY HIGHER SENSE‚ÄÎIS THE WORK AND INVENTION OF FRANCE; EUROPEAN VULGARITY, THE PLEBEIANISM OF MODERN IDEAS, THAT OF ENGLAND.‚ÄÎ33





254


EVEN NOW FRANCE IS STILL THE SEAT OF THE MOST SPIRITUAL AND SOPHISTICATED CULTURE IN EUROPE AND THE FOREMOST SCHOOL OF TASTE‚ÄÎBUT ONE HAS TO KNOW HOW TO FIND THIS ‚ÄÚFRANCE OF TASTE.‚ÄÙ 34 THOSE WHO BELONG TO IT STAY WELL HIDDEN: IT MAY BE A SMALL NUMBER IN WHOM IT LIVES‚ÄÎAT THAT, PERHAPS HUMAN BEINGS WHOSE LEGS MIGHT BE STURDIER, SOME OF THEM FATALISTS, SOMBER AND SICK, SOME OF THEM OVERLY DELICATE AND ARTIFICIAL, SUCH AS HAVE THE AMBITION TO HIDE. ONE POINT THEY ALL HAVE IN COMMON: THEY PLUG THEIR EARS AGAINST THE RAGING STUPIDITY AND THE NOISY TWADDLE OF THE DEMOCRATIC BOURGEOIS. INDEED, THE FOREGROUND TODAY IS TAKEN UP BY A PART OF FRANCE THAT HAS BECOME STUPID AND COARSE: RECENTLY, AT VICTOR HUGO‚ÄÔS FUNERAL,35 IT CELEBRATED A VERITABLE ORGY OF BAD TASTE AND AT THE SAME TIME SELF-ADMIRATION. THEY HAVE IN COMMON ONE OTHER POINT AS WELL: THE GOOD WILL TO RESIST ANY SPIRITUAL GERMANIZATION‚ÄÎAND A STILL BETTER INCAPACITY TO SUCCEED.

PERHAPS SCHOPENHAUER IS EVEN NOW MORE AT HOME AND INDIGENOUS IN THIS FRANCE OF THE SPIRIT, WHICH IS ALSO A FRANCE OF PESSIMISM, THAN HE EVER WAS IN GERMANY‚ÄÎNOT TO SPEAK OF HEINRICH HEINE, WHO HAS LONG BECOME PART OF THE VERY FLESH AND BLOOD OF THE SUBTLER AND MORE DEMANDING LYRIC POETS OF PARIS, OR OF HEGEL, WHO TODAY EXERTS AN ALMOST TYRANNICAL INFLUENCE THROUGH TAINE, WHO IS THE FOREMOST HISTORIAN NOW LIVING. BUT AS FOR RICHARD WAGNER: THE MORE FRENCH MUSIC LEARNS TO FORM ITSELF IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACTUAL NEEDS OF THE √¢ME MODERNE,36 THE MORE IT WILL ‚ÄÚWAGNERIZE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT ONE CAN PREDICT‚ÄÎAND IT IS DOING ENOUGH OF THAT EVEN NOW.

NEVERTHELESS, THERE ARE THREE THINGS TO WHICH THE FRENCH CAN STILL POINT WITH PRIDE TODAY, AS THEIR HERITAGE AND POSSESSION AND AN ENDURING MARK OF THEIR ANCIENT CULTURAL SUPERIORITY OVER EUROPE, IN SPITE OF ALL VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY GERMANIZATION AND VULGARIZATION OF THEIR TASTE. FIRST, THE CAPACITY FOR ARTISTIC PASSIONS, FOR THAT DEVOTION TO ‚ÄÚFORM‚ÄÙ FOR WHICH THE PHRASE L‚ÄÔART POUR L‚ÄÔART HAS BEEN INVENTED ALONG WITH A THOUSAND OTHERS: THAT SORT OF THING HAS NOT BEEN LACKING IN FRANCE FOR THE LAST THREE CENTURIES AND HAS MADE POSSIBLE AGAIN AND AGAIN, THANKS TO THEIR REVERENCE FOR THE ‚ÄÚSMALL NUMBER,‚ÄÙ A KIND OF CHAMBER MUSIC IN LITERATURE FOR WHICH ONE LOOKS IN VAIN IN THE REST OF EUROPE.

THE SECOND THING ON WHICH THE FRENCH CAN BASE A SUPERIORITY OVER EUROPE IS THEIR OLD, MANIFOLD, MORALISTIC37 CULTURE, AS A RESULT OF WHICH WE FIND, ON THE AVERAGE, EVEN IN THE LITTLE ROMANCIERS OF THE NEWSPAPERS AND IN CHANCE BOULEVARDIERS DE PARIS A PSYCHOLOGICAL OVERSENSITIVITY AND CURIOSITY OF WHICH IN GERMANY, FOR EXAMPLE, ONE SIMPLY HAS NO IDEA (LET ALONE THE THING ITSELF). FOR THIS THE GERMANS LACK A FEW CENTURIES OF MORALISTIC WORK WHICH, AS MENTIONED, FRANCE DID NOT SPARE HERSELF; ANYONE WHO CALLS THE GERMANS ‚ÄÚNA√ØVE‚ÄÙ ON THAT ACCOUNT PRAISES THEM FOR A DEFECT. (BY WAY OF CONTRAST TO THE GERMAN INEXPERIENCE AND INNOCENCE IN VOLUPTATE PSYCHOLOGICAL,38 WHICH IS NONE TOO DISTANTLY RELATED TO THE TEDIOUSNESS OF GERMAN COMPANY, AND AS THE MOST CONSUMMATE EXPRESSION OF A TYPICALLY FRENCH CURIOSITY AND INVENTIVENESS FOR THIS REALM OF DELICATE THRILLS, ONE MAY CONSIDER HENRI BEYLE,39 THAT REMARKABLE ANTICIPATORY AND PRECURSORY HUMAN BEING WHO RAN WITH A NAPOLEONIC TEMPO THROUGH HIS EUROPE, THROUGH SEVERAL CENTURIES OF THE EUROPEAN SOUL, AS AN EXPLORER AND DISCOVERER OF THIS SOUL: IT REQUIRED TWO GENERATIONS TO CATCH UP WITH HIM IN ANY WAY, TO FIGURE OUT AGAIN A FEW OF THE RIDDLES THAT TORMENTED AND ENCHANTED HIM, THIS ODD EPICUREAN AND QUESTION MARK OF A MAN WHO WAS FRANCE‚ÄÔS LAST GREAT PSYCHOLOGIST.)

THERE IS YET A THIRD CLAIM TO SUPERIORITY. THE FRENCH CHARACTER CONTAINS A HALFWAY SUCCESSFUL SYNTHESIS OF THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO COMPREHEND MANY THINGS AND TO DO THINGS WHICH AN ENGLISHMAN COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND. THEIR TEMPERAMENT, PERIODICALLY TURNED TOWARD AND AWAY FROM THE SOUTH, IN WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME PROVEN√ßAL AND LIGURIAN BLOOD FOAMS OVER, PROTECTS THEM AGAINST THE GRUESOME NORTHERN GRAY ON GRAY AND THE SUNLESS CONCEPT-SPOOKING AND ANEMIA‚ÄÎTHE DISEASE OF GERMAN TASTE AGAINST WHOSE EXCESSES ONE HAS NOW PRESCRIBED FOR ONESELF, WITH CONSIDERABLE RESOLUTION, BLOOD AND IRON,40 WHICH MEANS ‚ÄÚGREAT POLITICS‚ÄÙ (IN ACCORDANCE WITH A DANGEROUS HEALING ART WHICH TEACHES ME TO WAIT AND WAIT BUT SO FAR HAS NOT TAUGHT ME ANY HOPE.) EVEN NOW ONE STILL ENCOUNTERS IN FRANCE AN ADVANCE UNDERSTANDING AND ACCOMMODATION OF THOSE RARER AND RARELY CONTENTED HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE TOO COMPREHENSIVE TO FIND SATISFACTION IN ANY FATHERLANDISHNESS AND KNOW HOW TO LOVE THE SOUTH IN THE NORTH AND THE NORTH IN THE SOUTH‚ÄÎTHE BORN MIDLANDERS, THE ‚ÄÚGOOD EUROPEANS.‚ÄÙ

IT WAS FOR THEM THAT BIZET MADE MUSIC, THIS LAST GENIUS TO SEE A NEW BEAUTY AND SEDUCTION‚ÄÎWHO DISCOVERED A PIECE OF THE SOUTH OF MUSIC.





255


AGAINST GERMAN MUSIC ALL KINDS OF PRECAUTIONS SEEM TO ME TO BE INDICATED. SUPPOSE SOMEBODY LOVES THE SOUTH AS I LOVE IT, AS A GREAT SCHOOL OF CONVALESCENCE, IN THE MOST SPIRITUAL AS WELL AS THE MOST SENSUOUS SENSE, AS AN UNCONTAINABLE ABUNDANCE OF SUN AND TRANSFIGURATION BY THE SUN THAT SUFFUSES AN EXISTENCE THAT BELIEVES AND GLORIES IN ITSELF: WELL, SUCH A PERSON WILL LEARN TO BE SOMEWHAT ON HIS GUARD AGAINST GERMAN MUSIC, BECAUSE IN CORRUPTING HIS TASTE AGAIN IT ALSO CORRUPTS HIS HEALTH AGAIN.

IF SUCH A SOUTHERNER, NOT BY DESCENT BUT BY FAITH, SHOULD DREAM OF THE FUTURE OF MUSIC, HE MUST ALSO DREAM OF THE REDEMPTION OF MUSIC FROM THE NORTH, AND IN HIS EARS HE MUST HAVE THE PRELUDE OF A MORE PROFOUND, MORE POWERFUL, PERHAPS MORE EVIL AND MYSTERIOUS MUSIC, A SUPRA-GERMAN MUSIC THAT DOES NOT FADE AWAY AT THE SIGHT OF THE VOLUPTUOUS BLUE SEA AND THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SKY, NOR DOES IT TURN YELLOW AND THEN PALE AS ALL GERMAN MUSIC DOES‚ÄÎA SUPRA-EUROPEAN MUSIC THAT PREVAILS EVEN BEFORE THE BROWN SUNSETS OF THE DESERT, A MUSIC WHOSE SOUL IS RELATED TO PALM TREES AND FEELS AT HOME AND KNOWS HOW TO ROAM AMONG GREAT, BEAUTIFUL, LONELY BEASTS OF PREY‚ÄÎ

I COULD IMAGINE A MUSIC WHOSE RAREST MAGIC WOULD CONSIST IN ITS NO LONGER KNOWING ANYTHING OF GOOD AND EVIL, ONLY NOW AND THEN SOME SAILOR NOSTALGIA, SOME GOLDEN SHADOWS AND DELICATE WEAKNESSES WOULD PASS OVER IT‚ÄÎAN ART THAT FROM A GREAT DISTANCE WOULD BEHOLD, FLEEING TOWARD IT, THE COLORS OF A SETTING MORAL WORLD THAT HAD ALMOST BECOME UNINTELLIGIBLE‚ÄÎAND THAT WOULD BE HOSPITABLE AND PROFOUND ENOUGH TO RECEIVE SUCH LATE FUGITIVES.‚ÄÎ





256


OWING TO THE PATHOLOGICAL ESTRANGEMENT WHICH THE INSANITY OF NATIONALITY HAS INDUCED, AND STILL INDUCES, AMONG THE PEOPLES OF EUROPE; OWING ALSO TO THE SHORTSIGHTED AND QUICK-HANDED POLITICIANS WHO ARE AT THE TOP TODAY WITH THE HELP OF THIS INSANITY, WITHOUT ANY INKLING THAT THEIR SEPARATIST POLICIES CAN OF NECESSITY ONLY BE ENTR‚ÄÔACTE POLICIES; OWING TO ALL THIS AND MUCH ELSE THAT TODAY SIMPLY CANNOT BE SAID, THE MOST UNEQUIVOCAL PORTENTS ARE NOW BEING OVERLOOKED, OR ARBITRARILY AND MENDACIOUSLY REINTERPRETED‚ÄÎTHAT EUROPE WANTS TO BECOME ONE.

IN ALL THE MORE PROFOUND AND COMPREHENSIVE MEN OF THIS CENTURY, THE OVER-ALL DIRECTION OF THE MYSTERIOUS WORKINGS OF THEIR SOUL WAS TO PREPARE THE WAY FOR THIS NEW SYNTHESIS AND TO ANTICIPATE EXPERIMENTALLY THE EUROPEAN OF THE FUTURE: ONLY IN THEIR FOREGROUNDS OR IN WEAKER HOURS, SAY IN OLD AGE, DID THEY BELONG TO THE ‚ÄÚFATHERLANDISH‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHEY WERE MERELY TAKING A REST FROM THEMSELVES WHEN THEY BECAME ‚ÄÚPATRIOTS.‚ÄÙ I AM THINKING OF SUCH HUMAN BEINGS AS NAPOLEON, GOETHE, BEETHOVEN, STENDHAL, HEINRICH HEINE, SCHOPENHAUER: DO NOT HOLD IT AGAINST ME WHEN I INCLUDE RICHARD WAGNER, TOO, WITH THEM, FOR ONE SHOULD NOT ALLOW ONESELF TO BE LED ASTRAY ABOUT HIM BY HIS OWN MISUNDERSTANDINGS‚ÄÎGENIUSES OF HIS TYPE RARELY HAVE THE RIGHT TO UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES. EVEN LESS, TO BE SURE, BY THE INDECENT NOISE WITH WHICH PEOPLE IN FRANCE NOW CLOSE THEMSELVES OFF AGAINST HIM AND RESIST HIM: THE FACT REMAINS NEVERTHELESS THAT THE LATE FRENCH ROMANTICISM OF THE FORTIES AND RICHARD WAGNER BELONG TOGETHER MOST CLOSELY AND INTIMATELY. IN ALL THE HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS OF THEIR NEEDS THEY ARE RELATED, FUNDAMENTALLY RELATED: IT IS EUROPE, THE ONE EUROPE, WHOSE SOUL SURGES AND LONGS TO GET FURTHER AND HIGHER THROUGH THEIR MANIFOLD AND IMPETUOUS ART‚ÄÎWHERE? INTO A NEW LIGHT? TOWARD A NEW SUN? BUT WHO COULD EXPRESS PRECISELY WHAT ALL THESE MASTERS OF NEW MEANS OF LANGUAGE COULD NOT EXPRESS PRECISELY? WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT THE SAME STORM AND STRESS TORMENTED THEM AND THAT THEY SOUGHT IN THE SAME WAY, THESE LAST GREAT SEEKERS!

LITERATURE DOMINATED ALL OF THEM UP TO THEIR EYES AND EARS‚ÄÎTHEY WERE THE FIRST ARTISTS STEEPED IN WORLD LITERATURE‚ÄÎAND MOST OF THEM WERE THEMSELVES WRITERS, POETS, MEDIATORS AND MIXERS OF THE ARTS AND SENSES (AS A MUSICIAN, WAGNER BELONGS AMONG PAINTERS; AS A POET, AMONG MUSICIANS; AS AN ARTIST IN GENERAL, AMONG ACTORS); ALL OF THEM WERE FANATICS OF EXPRESSION ‚ÄÚAT ANY PRICE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎI SHOULD STRESS DELACROIX, WHO WAS MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO WAGNER‚ÄÎALL OF THEM GREAT DISCOVERERS IN THE REALM OF THE SUBLIME, ALSO OF THE UGLY AND GRUESOME, AND STILL GREATER DISCOVERERS CONCERNING EFFECTS, DISPLAY, AND THE ART OF DISPLAY WINDOWS‚ÄÎALL OF THEM TALENTS FAR BEYOND THEIR GENIUS‚ÄÎVIRTUOSOS THROUGH AND THROUGH, WITH UNCANNY ACCESS TO EVERYTHING THAT SEDUCES, ALLURES, COMPELS, OVERTHROWS; BORN ENEMIES OF LOGIC AND STRAIGHT LINES, LUSTING AFTER THE FOREIGN, THE EXOTIC, THE TREMENDOUS, THE CROOKED, THE SELF-CONTRADICTORY; AS HUMAN BEINGS, TANTALUSES OF THE WILL, SUCCESSFUL PLEBEIANS WHO KNEW THEMSELVES TO BE INCAPABLE, BOTH IN THEIR LIVES AND WORKS, OF A NOBLE TEMPO, A LENTO41‚ÄÎTAKE BALZAC, FOR EXAMPLE‚ÄÎUNBRIDLED WORKERS, ALMOST SELF-DESTROYERS THROUGH WORK; ANTINOMIANS AND REBELS AGAINST CUSTOM, AMBITIOUS AND INSATIABLE WITHOUT BALANCE AND ENJOYMENT; ALL OF THEM BROKE AND COLLAPSED IN THE END BEFORE THE CHRISTIAN CROSS (WITH RIGHT AND REASON: FOR WHO AMONG THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN PROFOUND AND ORIGINAL42 ENOUGH FOR A PHILOSOPHY OF THE ANTICHRIST?)‚ÄÎON THE WHOLE, AN AUDACIOUSLY DARING, MAGNIFICENTLY VIOLENT TYPE OF HIGHER HUMAN BEINGS WHO SOARED, AND TORE OTHERS ALONG, TO THE HEIGHTS‚ÄÎIT FELL TO THEM TO FIRST TEACH THEIR CENTURY‚ÄÎAND IT IS THE CENTURY OF THE CROWD!‚ÄÎTHE CONCEPT ‚ÄÚHIGHER MAN‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎ

LET THE GERMAN FRIENDS OF RICHARD WAGNER PONDER WHETHER THERE IS IN WAGNER‚ÄÔS ART ANYTHING OUTRIGHT GERMAN, OR WHETHER IT IS NOT JUST ITS DISTINCTION THAT IT DERIVES FROM SUPRA-GERMAN SOURCES AND IMPULSES. NOR SHOULD IT BE UNDERESTIMATED TO WHAT EXTENT PARIS WAS INDISPENSABLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS TYPE, AND AT THE DECISIVE MOMENT THE DEPTH OF HIS INSTINCTS LED HIM TO PARIS. HIS ENTIRE MANNER AND SELF-APOSTOLATE COULD PERFECT ITSELF ONLY WHEN HE SAW THE MODEL OF THE FRENCH SOCIALISTS. PERHAPS IT WILL BE FOUND AFTER A SUBTLER COMPARISON THAT, TO THE HONOR OF RICHARD WAGNER‚ÄÔS GERMAN NATURE, HIS DOINGS WERE IN EVERY RESPECT STRONGER, MORE AUDACIOUS, HARDER, AND HIGHER THAN ANYTHING A FRENCHMAN OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY COULD MANAGE‚ÄÎTHANKS TO THE FACT THAT WE GERMANS ARE STILL CLOSER TO BARBARISM THAN THE FRENCH. PERHAPS WAGNER‚ÄÔS STRANGEST CREATION IS INACCESSIBLE, INIMITABLE, AND BEYOND THE FEELINGS OF THE WHOLE, SO MATURE, LATIN RACE, NOT ONLY TODAY BUT FOREVER: THE FIGURE OF SIEGFRIED, THAT VERY FREE MAN WHO MAY INDEED BE MUCH TOO FREE, TOO HARD, TOO CHEERFUL, TOO HEALTHY, TOO ANTI-CATHOLIC FOR THE TASTE OF ANCIENT AND MELLOW CULTURED PEOPLES. HE MAY EVEN HAVE BEEN A SIN AGAINST ROMANTICISM, THIS ANTI-ROMANTIC SIEGFRIED: WELL, WAGNER MORE THAN ATONED FOR THIS SIN IN HIS OLD AND GLUM DAYS WHEN‚ÄÎANTICIPATING A TASTE THAT HAS SINCE THEN BECOME POLITICAL‚ÄÎHE BEGAN, IF NOT TO WALK, AT LEAST TO PREACH, WITH HIS CHARACTERISTIC RELIGIOUS VEHEMENCE, THE WAY TO ROME.

LEST THESE FINAL WORDS BE MISUNDERSTOOD, I WILL ENLIST THE ASSISTANCE OF A FEW VIGOROUS RHYMES WHICH WILL BETRAY TO LESS SUBTLE EARS, TOO, WHAT I WANT‚ÄÎWHAT I HAVE AGAINST THE ‚ÄÚFINAL WAGNER‚ÄÙ AND HIS PARSIFAL MUSIC:

‚ÄÎIS THIS STILL GERMAN?‚ÄÎ

OUT OF A GERMAN HEART, THIS SULTRY SCREECHING?

A GERMAN BODY, THIS SELF-LACERATION?

GERMAN, THIS PRIESTLY AFFECTATION,

THIS INCENSE-PERFUMED SENSUAL PREACHING?

GERMAN, THIS HALTING, PLUNGING, REELING,

THIS SO UNCERTAIN BIM-BAM PEALING?

THIS NUNNISH OGLING, AVE LEAVENING,

THIS WHOLE FALSELY ECSTATIC HEAVEN OVERHEAVENING?

‚ÄÎIS THIS STILL GERMAN?‚ÄÎ

YOU STILL STAND AT THE GATE, PERPLEXED?

THINK! WHAT YOU HEAR IS ROME‚ÄÎROME‚ÄÔS FAITH WITHOUT THE TEXT.

2DUMPF HAS NO PERFECT EQUIVALENT IN ENGLISH. IT CAN MEAN HOLLOW OR MUTED WHEN APPLIED TO A SOUND, HEAVY AND MUSTY APPLIED TO AIR, DULL APPLIED TO WITS, AND IS A COUSIN OF THE ENGLISH WORDS, DUMB AND DAMP. GOETHE STILL USED IT WITH A POSITIVE CONNOTATION WHEN HE WROTE POETRY ABOUT INARTICULATE FEELINGS; NIETZSCHE USES THE WORD OFTEN‚ÄÎWITH A STRONGLY NEGATIVE, ANTI-ROMANTIC CONNOTATION.

3VERFLACHUNG (BECOMING SHALLOWER) CONTRASTED WITH VERTIEFUNG (BECOMING MORE PROFOUND). THE FIRST PEOPLE IS, WITHOUT A DOUBT, GERMANY; THE STATESMAN, BISMARCK; AND THE SECOND PEOPLE PROBABLY FRANCE. OF COURSE, THE POINTS MADE ARE ALSO MEANT TO APPLY MORE GENERALLY, BUT THIS EVALUATION OF BISMARCK AT THE ZENITH OF HIS SUCCESS AND POWER CERTAINLY SHOWS AN AMAZING INDEPENDENCE OF SPIRIT, AND WITHOUT GRASPING THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE FINAL SENTENCE ONE CANNOT BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CONCEPTIONS OF THE WILL TO POWER OR OF ‚ÄÚBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL.‚ÄÙ

19 BUT BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL IS FULL OF EXAMPLES, MOST OF WHICH HAVE BEEN PRESERVED IN TRANSLATION, THOUGH A FEW HAVE BEEN BROKEN UP INTO SHORTER SENTENCES. PLAINLY IT IS PART OF THE AIM OF THESE SECTIONS TO TELL THE READER HOW THE PRESENT BOOK WANTS TO BE READ.

20 NIETZSCHE INVERTS THE ANTI-SEMITIC CLICH√© THAT THE JEWS ARE UNCREATIVE PARASITES WHO EXCEL, IF AT ALL, ONLY AS PERFORMERS AND INTERPRETERS. (CF. ALSO, E.G., SECTION 52 ABOVE AND HIS PRAISE OF MENDELSSOHN IN SECTION 245.) THE IMAGE OF THE JEWS ‚ÄÚLUSTING AFTER FOREIGN RACES‚ÄÙ WAS A CLICH√© OF GERMAN ANTI-SEMITISM, BUT IT IS ENTIRELY CHARACTERISTIC OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS STYLE OF THINKING AND WRITING THAT THE PHRASE IS ‚ÄÚSPIRITUALIZED‚ÄÙ (TO USE HIS OWN TERM) AND MOREOVER USED IN A CONTEXT WHICH MAKES PLAIN‚ÄÎFOR THOSE WHO READ AND DO NOT MERELY BROWSE‚ÄÎTHAT NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS MEANING IS UTTERLY OPPOSED TO THAT PREVIOUSLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORDS. HIS FAMOUS ‚ÄÚREVALUATION‚ÄÙ BEGINS WITH WORDS THAT RECEIVE NEW VALUES.

NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CONCEPTION OF THE GREEKS AND ROMANS ALSO INVERTS THE USUAL VIEW. IN HIS FREQUENT INSISTENCE ON THE DEBT OF THE GREEKS TO EARLIER CIVILIZATIONS HE WAS AT LEAST HALF A CENTURY AHEAD OF HIS TIME.

21 CF. SECTION 195 ABOVE. IN THE LIGHT OF THESE TWO SECTIONS IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT THE REFERENCE TO THE GERMANS (‚ÄÚIN ALL MODESTY‚ÄÙ) IN SECTION 248 ALLUDES TO NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS OWN AMBITIONS. HE IS HOPING TO INITIATE A ‚ÄÚREVALUATION‚ÄÙ COMPARABLE TO THAT ASCRIBED TO THE JEWS IN SECTION 195: THEY ARE HIS MODEL. OF COURSE, HE DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE VALUES HE ASCRIBES TO THEM; BUT THE WHOLE BOOK REPRESENTS AN EFFORT TO RISE ‚ÄÚBEYOND‚ÄÙ SIMPLEMINDED AGREEMENT AND DISAGREEMENT, BEYOND THE VULGAR FAITH IN ANTITHETIC VALUES, ‚ÄÚBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL.‚ÄÙ THE POINT OF THAT TITLE IS NOT THAT THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS HIMSELF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL IN THE CRUDEST SENSE, BUT IT IS IN PART THAT HE IS BEYOND SAYING SUCH SILLY THINGS AS ‚ÄÚTHE JEWS ARE GOOD‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚTHE JEWS ARE EVIL;‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚFREE SPIRITS‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚSCHOLARS‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚVIRTUES‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚHONESTY‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚHUMANENESS‚ÄÙ ARE ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚEVIL.‚ÄÙ EVERYWHERE HE INTRODUCES DISTINCTIONS, ETCHING FIRST ONE TYPE AND THEN ANOTHER‚ÄÎBOTH GENERALLY CONFOUNDED UNDER A SINGLE LABEL. HE ASKS US TO SHIFT PERSPECTIVES, OR TO PERCEIVE HUES AND GRADATIONS INSTEAD OF SIMPLE BLACK AND WHITE. THIS HAS LED SUPERFICIAL READERS TO SUPPOSE THAT HE CONTRADICTS HIMSELF OR THAT HE NEVER EMBRACES ANY MEANINGFUL CONCLUSIONS (KARL JASPERS); BUT THIS BOOK ABOUNDS IN CONCLUSIONS. ONLY ONE CAN NEVER BE SURE WHAT THEY ARE AS LONG AS ONE TEARS SENTENCES AND HALF-SENTENCES OUT OF CONTEXT (THE METHOD OF BERTRAM AND JASPERS)‚ÄÎOR EVEN WHOLE APHORISMS: SECTION 240 IS MEANT TO BE READ BEFORE SECTION 241, NOT IN ISOLATION.

22 HEINRICH VON SYBEL (1817‚ÄÌ95) AND HEINRICH VON TREITSCHKE (1834‚ÄÌ96) WERE AMONG THE LEADING GERMAN HISTORIANS OF THEIR TIME. SYBEL WAS FOR MANY YEARS A MEMBER OF THE PRUSSIAN PARLIAMENT. AT ONE TIME A CRITIC OF BISMARCK, HE STRONGLY SUPPORTED MANY OF BISMARCK‚ÄÔS POLICIES, BEGINNING IN 1866. IN 1875 BISMARCK APPOINTED HIM DIRECTOR OF THE PRUSSIAN ARCHIVES. HIS MAJOR WORKS INCLUDE DIE DEUTSCHE NATION UND DAS KAISERREICH (THE GERMAN NATION AND THE EMPIRE; 1862) AND DIE BEGR√ºNDUNG DES DEUTSCHEN REICHES DURCH WILHELM I (1889‚ÄÌ94; ENGLISH VERSION, THE FOUNDING OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE BY WILLIAM I, TRANS. MARSHALL LIVINGSTON, 1890-98).

TREITSCHKE, BORN AT DRESDEN, WAS A LIBERAL AS A YOUNG MAN. BY 1866, WHEN PRUSSIA WENT TO WAR AGAINST AUSTRIA, ‚ÄÚHIS SYMPATHIES WITH PRUSSIA WERE SO STRONG THAT HE WENT TO BERLIN [FROM FREIBURG, WHERE HE HAD BEEN A PROFESSOR], BECAME A PRUSSIAN SUBJECT, AND WAS APPOINTED EDITOR OF THE PREUSSISCHE JAHRB√ºCHER‚ÄÙ (ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA, 11TH ED.). IN 1871 HE BECAME A MEMBER OF THE NEW IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT, AND IN 1874 A PROFESSOR OF HISTORY AT BERLIN. HE BECAME ‚ÄÚTHE CHIEF PANEGYRIST OF THE HOUSE OF HOHENZOLLERN. HE DID MORE THAN ANYONE TO MOULD THE MINDS OF THE RISING GENERATION, AND HE CARRIED THEM WITH HIM EVEN IN HIS VIOLENT ATTACKS ON ALL OPINIONS AND ALL PARTIES WHICH APPEARED IN ANY WAY TO BE INJURIOUS TO THE RISING POWER OF GERMANY. HE SUPPORTED THE GOVERNMENT IN ITS ATTEMPTS TO SUBDUE BY LEGISLATION THE SOCIALISTS, POLES, AND CATHOLICS; AND HE WAS ONE OF THE FEW MEN OF EMINENCE WHO GAVE THE SANCTION OF HIS NAME TO THE ATTACKS ON THE JEWS WHICH BEGAN IN 1878. AS A STRONG ADVOCATE OF COLONIAL EXPANSION, HE WAS ALSO A BITTER ENEMY OF GREAT BRITAIN, AND HE WAS TO A LARGE EXTENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ANTI-BRITISH FEELING OF GERMAN CHAUVINISM DURING THE LAST YEARS OF THE 19TH CENTURY‚ÄÙ (IBID.).

ALTHOUGH ALL OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS REFERENCES TO TREITSCHKE ARE VITRIOLIC (THERE ARE THREE IN ECCE HOMO), UNINFORMED WRITERS HAVE OCCASIONALLY LINKED NIETZSCHE AND TREITSCHKE AS IF BOTH HAD BEEN GERMAN NATIONALISTS.

27 NONE OF THIS PREVENTED RICHARD OEHLER FROM QUOTING A PASSAGE FROM THIS SECTION, OUT OF CONTEXT, IN ONE OF THE FIRST NAZI BOOKS ON NIETZSCHE, AFTER SAYING: ‚ÄÚTO WISH TO GIVE PROOF REGARDING NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS THOUGHTS IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THAT THEY AGREE WITH THE RACE VIEWS AND STRIVINGS OF THE NATIONAL SOCIALIST MOVEMENT WOULD BE CARRYING COALS TO NEWCASTLE‚ÄÙ (FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE UND DIE DEUTSCHE ZUKUNFT, LEIPZIG [FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE AND THE GERMAN FUTURE], 1935). OEHLER KNEW BETTER: HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE EDITORS OF THE COLLECTED WORKS AND HAD EVEN THEN COMPILED ELABORATE INDICES FOR TWO EDITIONS‚ÄÎONE OF THESE INDICES COMPRISED TWO AND A HALF LARGE VOLUMES‚ÄÎAND LATER HE COMPILED A THIRD ONE FOR YET ANOTHER EDITION. BUT THE NAZIS‚ÄÔ OCCASIONAL USE AND PERVERSION OF NIETZSCHE WAS COMPLETELY DEVOID OF THE MOST ELEMENTARY SCRUPLES. FOR OTHER EXAMPLES SEE KAUFMANN‚ÄÔS NIETZSCHE, CHAPTER 10.

31 IN FACT, HEGEL, WHO WAS THEN VERY FAMOUS AND INFLUENTIAL, NEVER WRONGED SCHOPENHAUER, WHO WAS YOUNG, UNKNOWN, AND DELIBERATELY PROVOCATIVE; BUT SCHOPENHAUER ATTACKED HEGEL AFTER HIS DEATH IN THE STRONGEST TERMS, IN PRINT. SEE WALTER KAUFMANN, HEGEL (GARDEN CITY, N.Y., DOUBLEDAY, 1965), SECTION 54. IT IS REMARKABLE HOW COMPLETELY NIETZSCHE EMANCIPATED HIMSELF FROM SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS VIEW OF HEGEL, CONSIDERING NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS EARLY ENTHUSIASM FOR SCHOPENHAUER.

32 FRENCH SOUL.

33 NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS INFLUENCE ON FRENCH LETTERS SINCE THE TURN OF THE CENTURY HAS BEEN SECOND ONLY TO HIS INFLUENCE ON GERMAN LITERATURE AND THOUGHT; HIS REPUTATION IN ENGLAND HAS BEEN NEGLIGIBLE. THE BRITISH WRITERS OF THE FIRST RANK WHO WERE INFLUENCED GREATLY BY HIM WERE IRISH: SHAW, YEATS, AND JOYCE.

34 PARTS OF THIS SECTION WERE LATER INCLUDED BY NIETZSCHE, SLIGHTLY REVISED, IN NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER, IN THE CHAPTER ‚ÄÚWHERE WAGNER BELONGS‚ÄÙ (PORTABLE NIETZSCHE.). HE ALSO USED SECTION 256 IN THE SAME CHAPTER OF NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER AND IN THE FOLLOWING ONE, AND SECTIONS 269 AND 270 FOR THE CHAPTER ‚ÄÚTHE PSYCHOLOGIST SPEAKS UP‚ÄÙ.

40 BISMARCK‚ÄÔS FAMOUS PHRASE. ON MAY 12, 1859, WRITING TO THE CABINET MINISTER SCHLEINITZ FROM ST.

IT WAS A MATTER OF MILITARY QUESTIONS, AND I SAID: PLACE AS GREAT A MILITARY FORCE AS POSSIBLE, IN OTHER WORDS AS MUCH BLOOD AND IRON AS POSSIBLE, IN THE HAND OF THE KING OF PRUSSIA, THEN HE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE THE POLITICS YOU DESIRE; WITH SPEECHES AND RIFLEMEN‚ÄÔS FESTIVALS AND SONGS IT CANNOT BE MADE; IT CAN BE MADE ONLY WITH BLOOD AND IRON.‚ÄÙ

EVERY ENHANCEMENT OF THE TYPE ‚ÄÚMAN‚ÄÙ HAS SO FAR BEEN THE WORK OF AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY‚ÄÎAND IT WILL BE SO AGAIN AND AGAIN‚ÄÎA SOCIETY THAT BELIEVES IN THE LONG LADDER OF AN ORDER OF RANK AND DIFFERENCES IN VALUE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN, AND THAT NEEDS SLAVERY IN SOME SENSE OR OTHER. WITHOUT THAT PATHOS OF DISTANCE WHICH GROWS OUT OF THE INGRAINED DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRATA2‚ÄÎWHEN THE RULING CASTE CONSTANTLY LOOKS AFAR AND LOOKS DOWN UPON SUBJECTS AND INSTRUMENTS AND JUST AS CONSTANTLY PRACTICES OBEDIENCE AND COMMAND, KEEPING DOWN AND KEEPING AT A DISTANCE‚ÄÎTHAT OTHER, MORE MYSTERIOUS PATHOS COULD NOT HAVE GROWN UP EITHER‚ÄÎTHE CRAVING FOR AN EVER NEW WIDENING OF DISTANCES WITHIN THE SOUL ITSELF, THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVER HIGHER, RARER, MORE REMOTE, FURTHER-STRETCHING, MORE COMPREHENSIVE STATES‚ÄÎIN BRIEF, SIMPLY THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE TYPE ‚ÄÚMAN,‚ÄÙ THE CONTINUAL ‚ÄÚSELF-OVERCOMING OF MAN,‚ÄÙ TO USE A MORAL FORMULA IN A SUPRA-MORAL SENSE.

TO BE SURE, ONE SHOULD NOT YIELD TO HUMANITARIAN ILLUSIONS ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY (AND THUS OF THE PRESUPPOSITION OF THIS ENHANCEMENT OF THE TYPE ‚ÄÚMAN‚ÄÙ): TRUTH IS HARD. LET US ADMIT TO OURSELVES, WITHOUT TRYING TO BE CONSIDERATE, HOW EVERY HIGHER CULTURE ON EARTH SO FAR HAS BEGUN. HUMAN BEINGS WHOSE NATURE WAS STILL NATURAL, BARBARIANS IN EVERY TERRIBLE SENSE OF THE WORD, MEN OF PREY WHO WERE STILL IN POSSESSION OF UNBROKEN STRENGTH OF WILL AND LUST FOR POWER, HURLED THEMSELVES UPON WEAKER, MORE CIVILIZED, MORE PEACEFUL RACES, PERHAPS TRADERS OR CATTLE RAISERS, OR UPON MELLOW OLD CULTURES WHOSE LAST VITALITY WAS EVEN THEN FLARING UP IN SPLENDID FIREWORKS OF SPIRIT AND CORRUPTION. IN THE BEGINNING, THE NOBLE CASTE WAS ALWAYS THE BARBARIAN CASTE: THEIR PREDOMINANCE DID NOT LIE MAINLY IN PHYSICAL STRENGTH BUT IN STRENGTH OF THE SOUL‚ÄÎTHEY WERE MORE WHOLE HUMAN BEINGS (WHICH ALSO MEANS, AT EVERY LEVEL, ‚ÄÚMORE WHOLE BEASTS‚ÄÙ).





258


CORRUPTION AS THE EXPRESSION OF A THREATENING ANARCHY AMONG THE INSTINCTS AND OF THE FACT THAT THE FOUNDATION OF THE AFFECTS, WHICH IS CALLED ‚ÄÚLIFE,‚ÄÙ HAS BEEN SHAKEN: CORRUPTION IS SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE ORGANISM IN WHICH IT APPEARS. WHEN, FOR EXAMPLE, AN ARISTOCRACY, LIKE THAT OF FRANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE REVOLUTION, THROWS AWAY ITS PRIVILEGES WITH A SUBLIME DISGUST AND SACRIFICES ITSELF TO AN EXTRAVAGANCE OF ITS OWN MORAL FEELINGS, THAT IS CORRUPTION; IT WAS REALLY ONLY THE LAST ACT OF THAT CENTURIES-OLD CORRUPTION WHICH HAD LED THEM TO SURRENDER, STEP BY STEP, THEIR GOVERNMENTAL PREROGATIVES, DEMOTING THEMSELVES TO A MERE FUNCTION OF THE MONARCHY (FINALLY EVEN TO A MERE ORNAMENT AND SHOWPIECE). THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTIC OF A GOOD AND HEALTHY ARISTOCRACY, HOWEVER, IS THAT IT EXPERIENCES ITSELF NOT AS A FUNCTION (WHETHER OF THE MONARCHY OR THE COMMONWEALTH) BUT AS THEIR MEANING AND HIGHEST JUSTIFICATION‚ÄÎTHAT IT THEREFORE ACCEPTS WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THE SACRIFICE OF UNTOLD HUMAN BEINGS WHO, FOR ITS SAKE, MUST BE REDUCED AND LOWERED TO INCOMPLETE HUMAN BEINGS, TO SLAVES, TO INSTRUMENTS. THEIR FUNDAMENTAL FAITH SIMPLY HAS TO BE THAT SOCIETY MUST NOT EXIST FOR SOCIETY‚ÄÔS SAKE BUT ONLY AS THE FOUNDATION AND SCAFFOLDING ON WHICH A CHOICE TYPE OF BEING IS ABLE TO RAISE ITSELF TO ITS HIGHER TASK AND TO A HIGHER STATE OF BEING3‚ÄÎCOMPARABLE TO THOSE SUN-SEEKING VINES OF JAVA‚ÄÎTHEY ARE CALLED SIPO MATADOR‚ÄÎTHAT SO LONG AND SO OFTEN ENCLASP AN OAK TREE WITH THEIR TENDRILS UNTIL EVENTUALLY, HIGH ABOVE IT BUT SUPPORTED BY IT, THEY CAN UNFOLD THEIR CROWNS IN THE OPEN LIGHT AND DISPLAY THEIR HAPPINESS.





259


REFRAINING MUTUALLY FROM INJURY, VIOLENCE, AND EXPLOITATION AND PLACING ONE‚ÄÔS WILL ON A PAR WITH THAT OF SOMEONE ELSE‚ÄÎTHIS MAY BECOME, IN A CERTAIN ROUGH SENSE, GOOD MANNERS AMONG INDIVIDUALS IF THE APPROPRIATE CONDITIONS ARE PRESENT (NAMELY, IF THESE MEN ARE ACTUALLY SIMILAR IN STRENGTH AND VALUE STANDARDS AND BELONG TOGETHER IN ONE BODY). BUT AS SOON AS THIS PRINCIPLE IS EXTENDED, AND POSSIBLY EVEN ACCEPTED AS THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF SOCIETY, IT IMMEDIATELY PROVES TO BE WHAT IT REALLY IS‚ÄÎA WILL TO THE DENIAL OF LIFE, A PRINCIPLE OF DISINTEGRATION AND DECAY.

HERE WE MUST BEWARE OF SUPERFICIALITY AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MATTER, RESISTING ALL SENTIMENTAL WEAKNESS: LIFE ITSELF IS ESSENTIALLY APPROPRIATION, INJURY, OVERPOWERING OF WHAT IS ALIEN AND WEAKER; SUPPRESSION, HARDNESS, IMPOSITION OF ONE‚ÄÔS OWN FORMS, INCORPORATION AND AT LEAST, AT ITS MILDEST, EXPLOITATION‚ÄÎBUT WHY SHOULD ONE ALWAYS USE THOSE WORDS IN WHICH A SLANDEROUS INTENT HAS BEEN IMPRINTED FOR AGES?

EVEN THE BODY WITHIN WHICH INDIVIDUALS TREAT EACH OTHER AS EQUALS, AS SUGGESTED BEFORE‚ÄÎAND THIS HAPPENS IN EVERY HEALTHY ARISTOCRACY‚ÄÎIF IT IS A LIVING AND NOT A DYING BODY, HAS TO DO TO OTHER BODIES WHAT THE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN IT REFRAIN FROM DOING TO EACH OTHER: IT WILL HAVE TO BE AN INCARNATE WILL TO POWER, IT WILL STRIVE TO GROW, SPREAD, SEIZE, BECOME PREDOMINANT‚ÄÎNOT FROM ANY MORALITY OR IMMORALITY BUT BECAUSE IT IS LIVING AND BECAUSE LIFE SIMPLY IS WILL TO POWER. BUT THERE IS NO POINT ON WHICH THE ORDINARY CONSCIOUSNESS OF EUROPEANS RESISTS INSTRUCTION AS ON THIS: EVERYWHERE PEOPLE ARE NOW RAVING, EVEN UNDER SCIENTIFIC DISGUISES, ABOUT COMING CONDITIONS OF SOCIETY IN WHICH ‚ÄÚTHE EXPLOITATIVE ASPECT‚ÄÙ WILL BE REMOVED‚ÄÎWHICH SOUNDS TO ME AS IF THEY PROMISED TO INVENT A WAY OF LIFE THAT WOULD DISPENSE WITH ALL ORGANIC FUNCTIONS. ‚ÄÚEXPLOITATION‚ÄÙ DOES NOT BELONG TO A CORRUPT OR IMPERFECT AND PRIMITIVE SOCIETY: IT BELONGS TO THE ESSENCE OF WHAT LIVES, AS A BASIC ORGANIC FUNCTION; IT IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE WILL TO POWER, WHICH IS AFTER ALL THE WILL OF LIFE.

IF THIS SHOULD BE AN INNOVATION AS A THEORY‚ÄÎAS A REALITY IT IS THE PRIMORDIAL FACT OF ALL HISTORY: PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE HONEST WITH THEMSELVES AT LEAST THAT FAR.

WANDERING THROUGH THE MANY SUBTLER AND COARSER MORALITIES WHICH HAVE SO FAR BEEN PREVALENT ON EARTH, OR STILL ARE PREVALENT, I FOUND THAT CERTAIN FEATURES RECURRED REGULARLY TOGETHER AND WERE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED‚ÄÎUNTIL I FINALLY DISCOVERED TWO BASIC TYPES AND ONE BASIC DIFFERENCE.

THERE ARE MASTER MORALITY AND SLAVE MORALITY4‚ÄÎI ADD IMMEDIATELY THAT IN ALL THE HIGHER AND MORE MIXED CULTURES THERE ALSO APPEAR ATTEMPTS AT MEDIATION BETWEEN THESE TWO MORALITIES, AND YET MORE OFTEN THE INTERPENETRATION AND MUTUAL MISUNDERSTANDING OF BOTH, AND AT TIMES THEY OCCUR DIRECTLY ALONGSIDE EACH OTHER‚ÄÎEVEN IN THE SAME HUMAN BEING, WITHIN A SINGLE SOUL.5 THE MORAL DISCRIMINATION OF VALUES HAS ORIGINATED EITHER AMONG A RULING GROUP WHOSE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ITS DIFFERENCE FROM THE RULED GROUP WAS ACCOMPANIED BY DELIGHT‚ÄÎOR AMONG THE RULED, THE SLAVES AND DEPENDENTS OF EVERY DEGREE.

IN THE FIRST CASE, WHEN THE RULING GROUP DETERMINES WHAT IS ‚ÄÚGOOD,‚ÄÙ THE EXALTED, PROUD STATES OF THE SOUL ARE EXPERIENCED AS CONFERRING DISTINCTION AND DETERMINING THE ORDER OF RANK. THE NOBLE HUMAN BEING SEPARATES FROM HIMSELF THOSE IN WHOM THE OPPOSITE OF SUCH EXALTED, PROUD STATES FINDS EXPRESSION: HE DESPISES THEM. IT SHOULD BE NOTED IMMEDIATELY THAT IN THIS FIRST TYPE OF MORALITY THE OPPOSITION OF ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚBAD‚ÄÙ MEANS APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AS ‚ÄÚNOBLE‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚCONTEMPTIBLE.‚ÄÙ (THE OPPOSITION OF ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚEVIL‚ÄÙ HAS A DIFFERENT ORIGIN.) ONE FEELS CONTEMPT FOR THE COWARDLY, THE ANXIOUS, THE PETTY, THOSE INTENT ON NARROW UTILITY; ALSO FOR THE SUSPICIOUS WITH THEIR UNFREE GLANCES, THOSE WHO HUMBLE THEMSELVES, THE DOGLIKE PEOPLE WHO ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE MALTREATED, THE BEGGING FLATTERERS, ABOVE ALL THE LIARS: IT IS PART OF THE FUNDAMENTAL FAITH OF ALL ARISTOCRATS THAT THE COMMON PEOPLE LIE. ‚ÄÚWE TRUTHFUL ONES‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHUS THE NOBILITY OF ANCIENT GREECE REFERRED TO ITSELF.

IT IS OBVIOUS THAT MORAL DESIGNATIONS WERE EVERYWHERE FIRST APPLIED TO HUMAN BEINGS AND ONLY LATER, DERIVATIVELY, TO ACTIONS. THEREFORE IT IS A GROSS MISTAKE WHEN HISTORIANS OF MORALITY START FROM SUCH QUESTIONS AS: WHY WAS THE COMPASSIONATE ACT PRAISED? THE NOBLE TYPE OF MAN EXPERIENCES ITSELF AS DETERMINING VALUES; IT DOES NOT NEED APPROVAL; IT JUDGES, ‚ÄÚWHAT IS HARMFUL TO ME IS HARMFUL IN ITSELF;‚ÄÙ IT KNOWS ITSELF TO BE THAT WHICH FIRST ACCORDS HONOR TO THINGS; IT IS VALUE-CREATING. EVERYTHING IT KNOWS AS PART OF ITSELF IT HONORS: SUCH A MORALITY IS SELF-GLORIFICATION. IN THE FOREGROUND THERE IS THE FEELING OF FULLNESS, OF POWER THAT SEEKS TO OVERFLOW, THE HAPPINESS OF HIGH TENSION, THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF WEALTH THAT WOULD GIVE AND BESTOW: THE NOBLE HUMAN BEING, TOO, HELPS THE UNFORTUNATE, BUT NOT, OR ALMOST NOT, FROM PITY, BUT PROMPTED MORE BY AN URGE BEGOTTEN BY EXCESS OF POWER. THE NOBLE HUMAN BEING HONORS HIMSELF AS ONE WHO IS POWERFUL, ALSO AS ONE WHO HAS POWER OVER HIMSELF, WHO KNOWS HOW TO SPEAK AND BE SILENT, WHO DELIGHTS IN BEING SEVERE AND HARD WITH HIMSELF AND RESPECTS ALL SEVERITY AND HARDNESS. ‚ÄÚA HARD HEART WOTAN PUT INTO MY BREAST,‚ÄÙ SAYS AN OLD SCANDINAVIAN SAGA: A FITTING POETIC EXPRESSION, SEEING THAT IT COMES FROM THE SOUL OF A PROUD VIKING. SUCH A TYPE OF MAN IS ACTUALLY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT HE IS NOT MADE FOR PITY, AND THE HERO OF THE SAGA THEREFORE ADDS AS A WARNING: ‚ÄÚIF THE HEART IS NOT HARD IN YOUTH IT WILL NEVER HARDEN.‚ÄÙ NOBLE AND COURAGEOUS HUMAN BEINGS WHO THINK THAT WAY ARE FURTHEST REMOVED FROM THAT MORALITY WHICH FINDS THE DISTINCTION OF MORALITY PRECISELY IN PITY, OR IN ACTING FOR OTHERS, OR IN D√©SINT√©RESSEMENT; FAITH IN ONESELF, PRIDE IN ONESELF, A FUNDAMENTAL HOSTILITY AND IRONY AGAINST ‚ÄÚSELFLESSNESS‚ÄÙ BELONG JUST AS DEFINITELY TO NOBLE MORALITY AS DOES A SLIGHT DISDAIN AND CAUTION REGARDING COMPASSIONATE FEELINGS AND A ‚ÄÚWARM HEART.‚ÄÙ

IT IS THE POWERFUL WHO UNDERSTAND HOW TO HONOR; THIS IS THEIR ART, THEIR REALM OF INVENTION. THE PROFOUND REVERENCE FOR AGE AND TRADITION‚ÄÎALL LAW RESTS ON THIS DOUBLE REVERENCE‚ÄÎTHE FAITH AND PREJUDICE IN FAVOR OF ANCESTORS AND DISFAVOR OF THOSE YET TO COME ARE TYPICAL OF THE MORALITY OF THE POWERFUL; AND WHEN THE MEN OF ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS,‚ÄÙ CONVERSELY, BELIEVE ALMOST INSTINCTIVELY IN ‚ÄÚPROGRESS‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚTHE FUTURE‚ÄÙ AND MORE AND MORE LACK RESPECT FOR AGE, THIS IN ITSELF WOULD SUFFICIENTLY BETRAY THE IGNOBLE ORIGIN OF THESE ‚ÄÚIDEAS.‚ÄÙ

A MORALITY OF THE RULING GROUP, HOWEVER, IS MOST ALIEN AND EMBARRASSING TO THE PRESENT TASTE IN THE SEVERITY OF ITS PRINCIPLE THAT ONE HAS DUTIES ONLY TO ONE‚ÄÔS PEERS; THAT AGAINST BEINGS OF A LOWER RANK, AGAINST EVERYTHING ALIEN, ONE MAY BEHAVE AS ONE PLEASES OR ‚ÄÚAS THE HEART DESIRES,‚ÄÙ AND IN ANY CASE ‚ÄÚBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHERE PITY AND LIKE FEELINGS MAY FIND THEIR PLACE.6 THE CAPACITY FOR, AND THE DUTY OF, LONG GRATITUDE AND LONG REVENGE‚ÄÎBOTH ONLY AMONG ONE‚ÄÔS PEERS‚ÄÎREFINEMENT IN REPAYING, THE SOPHISTICATED CONCEPT OF FRIENDSHIP, A CERTAIN NECESSITY FOR HAVING ENEMIES (AS IT WERE, AS DRAINAGE DITCHES FOR THE AFFECTS OF ENVY, QUARRELSOMENESS, EXUBERANCE‚ÄÎAT BOTTOM, IN ORDER TO BE CAPABLE OF BEING GOOD FRIENDS): ALL THESE ARE TYPICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF NOBLE MORALITY WHICH, AS SUGGESTED, IS NOT THE MORALITY OF ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS‚ÄÙ AND THEREFORE IS HARD TO EMPATHIZE WITH TODAY, ALSO HARD TO DIG UP AND UNCOVER.7

IT IS DIFFERENT WITH THE SECOND TYPE OF MORALITY, SLAVE MORALITY. SUPPOSE THE VIOLATED, OPPRESSED, SUFFERING, UNFREE, WHO ARE UNCERTAIN OF THEMSELVES AND WEARY, MORALIZE: WHAT WILL THEIR MORAL VALUATIONS HAVE IN COMMON? PROBABLY, A PESSIMISTIC SUSPICION ABOUT THE WHOLE CONDITION OF MAN WILL FIND EXPRESSION, PERHAPS A CONDEMNATION OF MAN ALONG WITH HIS CONDITION. THE SLAVE‚ÄÔS EYE IS NOT FAVORABLE TO THE VIRTUES OF THE POWERFUL: HE IS SKEPTICAL AND SUSPICIOUS, SUBTLY SUSPICIOUS, OF ALL THE ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ THAT IS HONORED THERE‚ÄÎHE WOULD LIKE TO PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT EVEN THEIR HAPPINESS IS NOT GENUINE. CONVERSELY, THOSE QUALITIES ARE BROUGHT OUT AND FLOODED WITH LIGHT WHICH SERVE TO EASE EXISTENCE FOR THOSE WHO SUFFER: HERE PITY, THE COMPLAISANT AND OBLIGING HAND, THE WARM HEART, PATIENCE, INDUSTRY, HUMILITY, AND FRIENDLINESS ARE HONORED‚ÄÎFOR HERE THESE ARE THE MOST USEFUL QUALITIES AND ALMOST THE ONLY MEANS FOR ENDURING THE PRESSURE OF EXISTENCE. SLAVE MORALITY IS ESSENTIALLY A MORALITY OF UTILITY.

HERE IS THE PLACE FOR THE ORIGIN OF THAT FAMOUS OPPOSITION OF ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚEVIL‚ÄÙ: INTO EVIL ONE‚ÄÔS FEELINGS PROJECT POWER AND DANGEROUSNESS, A CERTAIN TERRIBLENESS, SUBTLETY, AND STRENGTH THAT DOES NOT PERMIT CONTEMPT TO DEVELOP. ACCORDING TO SLAVE MORALITY, THOSE WHO ARE ‚ÄÚEVIL‚ÄÙ THUS INSPIRE FEAR; ACCORDING TO MASTER MORALITY IT IS PRECISELY THOSE WHO ARE ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ THAT INSPIRE, AND WISH TO INSPIRE, FEAR, WHILE THE ‚ÄÚBAD‚ÄÙ ARE FELT TO BE CONTEMPTIBLE.

THE OPPOSITION REACHES ITS CLIMAX WHEN, AS A LOGICAL CONSEQUENCE OF SLAVE MORALITY, A TOUCH OF DISDAIN IS ASSOCIATED ALSO WITH THE ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ OF THIS MORALITY‚ÄÎTHIS MAY BE SLIGHT AND BENEVOLENT‚ÄÎBECAUSE THE GOOD HUMAN BEING HAS TO BE UNDANGEROUS IN THE SLAVES‚ÄÔ WAY OF THINKING: HE IS GOOD-NATURED, EASY TO DECEIVE, A LITTLE STUPID PERHAPS, UN BONHOMME.8 WHEREVER SLAVE MORALITY BECOMES PREPONDERANT, LANGUAGE TENDS TO BRING THE WORDS ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚSTUPID‚ÄÙ CLOSER TOGETHER.

ONE LAST FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE: THE LONGING FOR FREEDOM, THE INSTINCT FOR HAPPINESS AND THE SUBTLETIES OF THE FEELING OF FREEDOM BELONG JUST AS NECESSARILY TO SLAVE MORALITY AND MORALS AS ARTFUL AND ENTHUSIASTIC REVERENCE AND DEVOTION ARE THE REGULAR SYMPTOM OF AN ARISTOCRATIC WAY OF THINKING AND EVALUATING.

THIS MAKES PLAIN WHY LOVE AS PASSION‚ÄÎWHICH IS OUR EUROPEAN SPECIALTY‚ÄÎSIMPLY MUST BE OF NOBLE ORIGIN: AS IS WELL KNOWN, ITS INVENTION MUST BE CREDITED TO THE PROVEN√ßAL KNIGHT-POETS, THOSE MAGNIFICENT AND INVENTIVE HUMAN BEINGS OF THE ‚ÄÚGAI SABER‚ÄÙ9 TO WHOM EUROPE OWES SO MANY THINGS AND ALMOST OWES ITSELF.‚ÄÎ





261


AMONG THE THINGS THAT MAY BE HARDEST TO UNDERSTAND FOR A NOBLE HUMAN BEING IS VANITY: HE WILL BE TEMPTED TO DENY IT, WHERE ANOTHER TYPE OF HUMAN BEING COULD NOT FIND IT MORE PALPABLE. THE PROBLEM FOR HIM IS TO IMAGINE PEOPLE WHO SEEK TO CREATE A GOOD OPINION OF THEMSELVES WHICH THEY DO NOT HAVE OF THEMSELVES‚ÄÎAND THUS ALSO DO NOT ‚ÄÚDESERVE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND WHO NEVERTHELESS END UP BELIEVING THIS GOOD OPINION THEMSELVES. THIS STRIKES HIM HALF AS SUCH BAD TASTE AND LACK OF SELF-RESPECT, AND HALF AS SO BAROQUELY IRRATIONAL, THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO CONSIDER VANITY AS EXCEPTIONAL, AND IN MOST CASES WHEN IT IS SPOKEN OF HE DOUBTS IT.

HE WILL SAY, FOR EXAMPLE: ‚ÄÚI MAY BE MISTAKEN ABOUT MY VALUE AND NEVERTHELESS DEMAND THAT MY VALUE, EXACTLY AS I DEFINE IT, SHOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED BY OTHERS AS WELL‚ÄÎBUT THIS IS NO VANITY (BUT CONCEIT OR, MORE FREQUENTLY, WHAT IS CALLED ‚ÄÒHUMILITY‚ÄÔ OR ‚ÄÒMODESTY‚ÄÔ).‚ÄÙ OR: ‚ÄÚFOR MANY REASONS I MAY TAKE PLEASURE IN THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS: PERHAPS BECAUSE I HONOR AND LOVE THEM AND ALL THEIR PLEASURES GIVE ME PLEASURE; PERHAPS ALSO BECAUSE THEIR GOOD OPINION CONFIRMS AND STRENGTHENS MY FAITH IN MY OWN GOOD OPINION; PERHAPS BECAUSE THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS, EVEN IN CASES WHERE I DO NOT SHARE IT, IS STILL USEFUL TO ME OR PROMISES TO BECOME SO‚ÄÎBUT ALL THAT IS NOT VANITY.‚ÄÙ

THE NOBLE HUMAN BEING MUST FORCE HIMSELF, WITH THE AID OF HISTORY, TO RECOGNIZE THAT, SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL, IN ALL SOMEHOW DEPENDENT SOCIAL STRATA THE COMMON MAN WAS ONLY WHAT HE WAS CONSIDERED: NOT AT ALL USED TO POSITING VALUES HIMSELF, HE ALSO ATTACHED NO OTHER VALUE TO HIMSELF THAN HIS MASTERS ATTACHED TO HIM (IT IS THE CHARACTERISTIC RIGHT OF MASTERS TO CREATE VALUES).

IT MAY BE UNDERSTOOD AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF AN IMMENSE ATAVISM THAT EVEN NOW THE ORDINARY MAN STILL ALWAYS WAITS FOR AN OPINION ABOUT HIMSELF AND THEN INSTINCTIVELY SUBMITS TO THAT‚ÄÎBUT BY NO MEANS ONLY A ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ OPINION; ALSO A BAD AND UNFAIR ONE (CONSIDER, FOR EXAMPLE, THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE SELF-ESTIMATES AND SELF-UNDERESTIMATES THAT BELIEVING WOMEN ACCEPT FROM THEIR FATHER-CONFESSORS, AND BELIEVING CHRISTIANS QUITE GENERALLY FROM THEIR CHURCH).

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SLOWLY ARISING DEMOCRATIC ORDER OF THINGS (AND ITS CAUSE, THE INTERMARRIAGE OF MASTERS AND SLAVES), THE ORIGINALLY NOBLE AND RARE URGE TO ASCRIBE VALUE TO ONESELF ON ONE‚ÄÔS OWN AND TO ‚ÄÚTHINK WELL‚ÄÙ OF ONESELF WILL ACTUALLY BE ENCOURAGED AND SPREAD MORE AND MORE NOW; BUT IT IS ALWAYS OPPOSED BY AN OLDER, AMPLER, AND MORE DEEPLY INGRAINED PROPENSITY‚ÄÎAND IN THE PHENOMENON OF ‚ÄÚVANITY‚ÄÙ THIS OLDER PROPENSITY MASTERS THE YOUNGER ONE. THE VAIN PERSON IS DELIGHTED BY EVERY GOOD OPINION HE HEARS OF HIMSELF (QUITE APART FROM ALL CONSIDERATIONS OF ITS UTILITY, AND ALSO APART FROM TRUTH OR FALSEHOOD), JUST AS EVERY BAD OPINION OF HIM PAINS HIM: FOR HE SUBMITS TO BOTH, HE FEELS SUBJECTED TO THEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT OLDEST INSTINCT OF SUBMISSION THAT BREAKS OUT IN HIM.

IT IS ‚ÄÚTHE SLAVE‚ÄÙ IN THE BLOOD OF THE VAIN PERSON, A RESIDUE OF THE SLAVE‚ÄÔS CRAFTINESS‚ÄÎAND HOW MUCH ‚ÄÚSLAVE‚ÄÙ IS STILL RESIDUAL IN WOMAN, FOR EXAMPLE!‚ÄÎTHAT SEEKS TO SEDUCE HIM TO GOOD OPINIONS ABOUT HIMSELF; IT IS ALSO THE SLAVE WHO AFTERWARDS IMMEDIATELY PROSTRATES HIMSELF BEFORE THESE OPINIONS AS IF HE HAD NOT CALLED THEM FORTH.

AND TO SAY IT ONCE MORE: VANITY IS AN ATAVISM.

A SPECIES10 COMES TO BE, A TYPE BECOMES FIXED AND STRONG, THROUGH THE LONG FIGHT WITH ESSENTIALLY CONSTANT UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS. CONVERSELY, WE KNOW FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF BREEDERS11 THAT SPECIES ACCORDED SUPERABUNDANT NOURISHMENT AND QUITE GENERALLY EXTRA PROTECTION AND CARE SOON TEND MOST STRONGLY TOWARD VARIATIONS OF THE TYPE AND BECOME RICH IN MARVELS AND MONSTROSITIES (INCLUDING MONSTROUS VICES).

NOW LOOK FOR ONCE AT AN ARISTOCRATIC COMMONWEALTH‚ÄÎSAY, AN ANCIENT GREEK POLIS,12 OR VENICE‚ÄÎAS AN ARRANGEMENT, WHETHER VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY, FOR BREEDING:13 HUMAN BEINGS ARE TOGETHER THERE WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON THEMSELVES AND WANT THEIR SPECIES TO PREVAIL, MOST OFTEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PREVAIL OR RUN THE TERRIBLE RISK OF BEING EXTERMINATED. HERE THAT BOON, THAT EXCESS, AND THAT PROTECTION WHICH FAVOR VARIATIONS ARE LACKING; THE SPECIES NEEDS ITSELF AS A SPECIES, AS SOMETHING THAT CAN PREVAIL AND MAKE ITSELF DURABLE BY VIRTUE OF ITS VERY HARDNESS, UNIFORMITY, AND SIMPLICITY OF FORM, IN A CONSTANT FIGHT WITH ITS NEIGHBORS OR WITH THE OPPRESSED WHO ARE REBELLIOUS OR THREATEN REBELLION. MANIFOLD EXPERIENCE TEACHES THEM TO WHICH QUALITIES ABOVE ALL THEY OWE THE FACT THAT, DESPITE ALL GODS AND MEN, THEY ARE STILL THERE, THAT THEY HAVE ALWAYS TRIUMPHED: THESE QUALITIES THEY CALL VIRTUES, THESE VIRTUES ALONE THEY CULTIVATE.14 THEY DO THIS WITH HARDNESS, INDEED THEY WANT HARDNESS; EVERY ARISTOCRATIC MORALITY IS INTOLERANT‚ÄÎIN THE EDUCATION OF YOUTH, IN THEIR ARRANGEMENTS FOR WOMEN, IN THEIR MARRIAGE CUSTOMS, IN THE RELATIONS OF OLD AND YOUNG, IN THEIR PENAL LAWS (WHICH TAKE INTO ACCOUNT DEVIANTS ONLY)‚ÄÎTHEY CONSIDER INTOLERANCE ITSELF A VIRTUE, CALLING IT ‚ÄÚJUSTICE.‚ÄÙ

IN THIS WAY A TYPE WITH FEW BUT VERY STRONG TRAITS, A SPECIES OF SEVERE, WARLIKE, PRUDENTLY TACITURN MEN, CLOSE-MOUTHED AND CLOSELY LINKED (AND AS SUCH POSSESSED OF THE SUBTLEST FEELING FOR THE CHARMS AND NUANCES OF ASSOCIATION), IS FIXED BEYOND THE CHANGING GENERATIONS; THE CONTINUAL FIGHT AGAINST EVER CONSTANT UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS IS, AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY, THE CAUSE THAT FIXES AND HARDENS A TYPE.

EVENTUALLY, HOWEVER, A DAY ARRIVES WHEN CONDITIONS BECOME MORE FORTUNATE AND THE TREMENDOUS TENSION DECREASES; PERHAPS THERE ARE NO LONGER ANY ENEMIES AMONG ONE‚ÄÔS NEIGHBORS, AND THE MEANS OF LIFE, EVEN FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF LIFE, ARE SUPERABUNDANT. AT ONE STROKE THE BOND AND CONSTRAINT OF THE OLD DISCIPLINE15 ARE TORN: IT NO LONGER SEEMS NECESSARY, A CONDITION OF EXISTENCE‚ÄÎIF IT PERSISTED IT WOULD ONLY BE A FORM OF LUXURY, AN ARCHAIZING TASTE. VARIATION, WHETHER AS DEVIATION (TO SOMETHING HIGHER, SUBTLER, RARER) OR AS DEGENERATION AND MONSTROSITY, SUDDENLY APPEARS ON THE SCENE IN THE GREATEST ABUNDANCE AND MAGNIFICENCE; THE INDIVIDUAL DARES TO BE INDIVIDUAL AND DIFFERENT.

AT THESE TURNING POINTS OF HISTORY WE BEHOLD BESIDE ONE ANOTHER, AND OFTEN MUTUALLY INVOLVED AND ENTANGLED, A SPLENDID, MANIFOLD, JUNGLELIKE GROWTH AND UPWARD STRIVING, A KIND OF TROPICAL TEMPO IN THE COMPETITION TO GROW, AND A TREMENDOUS RUIN AND SELF-RUINATION, AS THE SAVAGE EGOISMS THAT HAVE TURNED, ALMOST EXPLODED, AGAINST ONE ANOTHER WRESTLE ‚ÄÚFOR SUN AND LIGHT‚ÄÙ AND CAN NO LONGER DERIVE ANY LIMIT, RESTRAINT, OR CONSIDERATION FROM THEIR PREVIOUS16 MORALITY. IT WAS THIS MORALITY ITSELF THAT DAMMED UP SUCH ENORMOUS STRENGTH AND BENT THE BOW IN SUCH A THREATENING MANNER; NOW IT IS ‚ÄÚOUTLIVED.‚ÄÙ THE DANGEROUS AND UNCANNY POINT HAS BEEN REACHED WHERE THE GREATER, MORE MANIFOLD, MORE COMPREHENSIVE LIFE TRANSCENDS AND LIVES BEYOND THE OLD MORALITY; THE ‚ÄÚINDIVIDUAL‚ÄÙ APPEARS, OBLIGED TO GIVE HIMSELF LAWS AND TO DEVELOP HIS OWN ARTS AND WILES FOR SELF-PRESERVATION, SELF-ENHANCEMENT, SELF-REDEMPTION.

ALL SORTS OF NEW WHAT-FORS AND WHEREWITHALS; NO SHARED FORMULAS ANY LONGER; MISUNDERSTANDING ALLIED WITH DISRESPECT; DECAY, CORRUPTION, SAND THE HIGHEST DESIRES GRUESOMELY ENTANGLED; THE GENIUS OF THE RACE OVERFLOWING FROM ALL CORNUCOPIAS OF GOOD AND BAD; A CALAMITOUS SIMULTANEITY OF SPRING AND FALL, FULL OF NEW CHARMS AND VEILS THAT CHARACTERIZE YOUNG, STILL UNEXHAUSTED, STILL UNWEARIED CORRUPTION. AGAIN DANGER IS THERE, THE MOTHER OF MORALS, GREAT DANGER, THIS TIME TRANSPOSED INTO THE INDIVIDUAL, INTO THE NEIGHBOR AND FRIEND, INTO THE ALLEY, INTO ONE‚ÄÔS OWN CHILD, INTO ONE‚ÄÔS OWN HEART, INTO THE MOST PERSONAL AND SECRET RECESSES OF WISH AND WILL: WHAT MAY THE MORAL PHILOSOPHERS EMERGING IN THIS AGE HAVE TO PREACH NOW?

THESE ACUTE OBSERVERS AND LOITERERS DISCOVER THAT THE END IS APPROACHING FAST, THAT EVERYTHING AROUND THEM IS CORRUPTED AND CORRUPTS, THAT NOTHING WILL STAND THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, EXCEPT ONE TYPE OF MAN, THE INCURABLY MEDIOCRE. THE MEDIOCRE ALONE HAVE A CHANCE OF CONTINUING THEIR TYPE AND PROPAGATING‚ÄÎTHEY ARE THE MEN OF THE FUTURE, THE ONLY SURVIVORS: ‚ÄÚBE LIKE THEM! BECOME MEDIOCRE!‚ÄÙ IS NOW THE ONLY MORALITY THAT STILL MAKES SENSE, THAT STILL GETS A HEARING.

BUT THIS MORALITY OF MEDIOCRITY IS HARD TO PREACH: AFTER ALL, IT MAY NEVER ADMIT WHAT IT IS AND WHAT IT WANTS. IT MUST SPEAK OF MEASURE AND DIGNITY AND DUTY AND NEIGHBOR LOVE‚ÄÎIT WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO CONCEAL ITS IRONY.‚ÄÎ





263


THERE IS AN INSTINCT FOR RANK WHICH, MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, IS A SIGN OF A HIGH RANK; THERE IS A DELIGHT IN THE NUANCES OF REVERENCE THAT ALLOWS US TO INFER NOBLE ORIGIN AND HABITS. THE REFINEMENT, GRACIOUSNESS, AND HEIGHT OF A SOUL IS TESTED DANGEROUSLY WHEN SOMETHING OF THE FIRST RANK PASSES BY WITHOUT BEING AS YET PROTECTED BY THE SHUDDERS OF AUTHORITY AGAINST OBTRUSIVE EFFORTS AND INEPTITUDES‚ÄÎSOMETHING THAT GOES ITS WAY UNMARKED, UNDISCOVERED, TEMPTING, PERHAPS CAPRICIOUSLY CONCEALED AND DISGUISED, LIKE A LIVING TOUCHSTONE. ANYONE TO WHOSE TASK AND PRACTICE IT BELONGS TO SEARCH OUT SOULS WILL EMPLOY THIS VERY ART IN MANY FORMS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE VALUE OF A SOUL AND THE UNALTERABLE, INNATE ORDER OF RANK TO WHICH IT BELONGS: HE WILL TEST IT FOR ITS INSTINCT OF REVERENCE.

DIFF√©RENCE ENGENDRE HAINE:17 THE BASENESS OF SOME PEOPLE SUDDENLY SPURTS UP LIKE DIRTY WATER WHEN SOME HOLY VESSEL, SOME PRECIOUS THING FROM A LOCKED SHRINE, SOME BOOK WITH THE MARKS OF A GREAT DESTINY, IS CARRIED PAST; AND ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS A REFLEX OF SILENCE, A HESITATION OF THE EYE, A CESSATION OF ALL GESTURES THAT EXPRESS HOW A SOUL FEELS THE PROXIMITY OF THE MOST VENERABLE. THE WAY IN WHICH REVERENCE FOR THE BIBLE HAS ON THE WHOLE BEEN MAINTAINED SO FAR IN EUROPE IS PERHAPS THE BEST BIT OF DISCIPLINE AND REFINEMENT OF MANNERS THAT EUROPE OWES TO CHRISTIANITY: SUCH BOOKS OF PROFUNDITY AND ULTIMATE SIGNIFICANCE REQUIRE SOME EXTERNAL TYRANNY OF AUTHORITY FOR THEIR PROTECTION IN ORDER TO GAIN THOSE MILLENNIA OF PERSISTENCE WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO EXHAUST THEM AND FIGURE THEM OUT.

MUCH IS GAINED ONCE THE FEELING HAS FINALLY BEEN CULTIVATED IN THE MASSES (AMONG THE SHALLOW AND IN THE HIGH-SPEED INTESTINES OF EVERY KIND) THAT THEY ARE NOT TO TOUCH EVERYTHING; THAT THERE ARE HOLY EXPERIENCES BEFORE WHICH THEY HAVE TO TAKE OFF THEIR SHOES AND KEEP AWAY THEIR UNCLEAN HANDS‚ÄÎTHIS IS ALMOST THEIR GREATEST ADVANCE TOWARD HUMANITY. CONVERSELY, PERHAPS THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT SO-CALLED EDUCATED PEOPLE AND BELIEVERS IN ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS‚ÄÙ THAT IS AS NAUSEOUS AS THEIR LACK OF MODESTY AND THE COMFORTABLE INSOLENCE OF THEIR EYES AND HANDS WITH WHICH THEY TOUCH, LICK, AND FINGER EVERYTHING; AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT EVEN AMONG THE COMMON PEOPLE, AMONG THE LESS EDUCATED, ESPECIALLY AMONG PEASANTS, ONE FINDS TODAY MORE RELATIVE NOBILITY OF TASTE AND TACTFUL REVERENCE THAN AMONG THE NEWSPAPER-READING DEMI-MONDE OF THE SPIRIT, THE EDUCATED.





264


ONE CANNOT ERASE FROM THE SOUL OF A HUMAN BEING WHAT HIS ANCESTORS LIKED MOST TO DO AND DID MOST CONSTANTLY: WHETHER THEY WERE, FOR EXAMPLE, ASSIDUOUS SAVERS AND APPURTENANCES OF A DESK AND CASH BOX, MODEST AND BOURGEOIS IN THEIR DESIRES, MODEST ALSO IN THEIR VIRTUES; OR WHETHER THEY LIVED ACCUSTOMED TO COMMANDING FROM DAWN TO DUSK, FOND OF ROUGH AMUSEMENTS AND ALSO PERHAPS OF EVEN ROUGHER DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES; OR WHETHER, FINALLY, AT SOME POINT THEY SACRIFICED ANCIENT PREROGATIVES OF BIRTH AND POSSESSIONS IN ORDER TO LIVE ENTIRELY FOR THEIR FAITH‚ÄÎTHEIR ‚ÄÚGOD‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAS MEN OF AN INEXORABLE AND DELICATE CONSCIENCE WHICH BLUSHES AT EVERY COMPROMISE. IT IS SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE THAT A HUMAN BEING SHOULD NOT HAVE THE QUALITIES AND PREFERENCES OF HIS PARENTS AND ANCESTORS IN HIS BODY, WHATEVER APPEARANCES MAY SUGGEST TO THE CONTRARY. THIS IS THE PROBLEM OF RACE.18

IF ONE KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT THE PARENTS, AN INFERENCE ABOUT THE CHILD IS PERMISSIBLE: ANY DISGUSTING INCONTINENCE, ANY NOOK ENVY, A CLUMSY INSISTENCE THAT ONE IS ALWAYS RIGHT‚ÄÎTHESE THREE THINGS TOGETHER HAVE ALWAYS CONSTITUTED THE CHARACTERISTIC TYPE OF THE PLEBEIAN‚ÄÎTHAT SORT OF THING MUST AS SURELY BE TRANSFERRED TO THE CHILD AS CORRUPTED BLOOD; AND WITH THE AID OF THE BEST EDUCATION ONE WILL AT BEST DECEIVE WITH REGARD TO SUCH A HEREDITY.

AND WHAT ELSE IS THE AIM OF EDUCATION AND ‚ÄÚCULTURE‚ÄÙ TODAY? IN OUR VERY POPULARITY-MINDED‚ÄÎTHAT IS, PLEBEIAN‚ÄÎAGE, ‚ÄÚEDUCATION‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚCULTURE‚ÄÙ HAVE TO BE ESSENTIALLY THE ART OF DECEIVING‚ÄÎABOUT ONE‚ÄÔS ORIGINS, THE INHERITED PLEBS IN ONE‚ÄÔS BODY AND SOUL. AN EDUCATOR WHO TODAY PREACHED TRUTHFULNESS ABOVE ALL AND CONSTANTLY CHALLENGED HIS STUDENTS, ‚ÄÚBE TRUE! BE NATURAL! DO NOT PRETEND!‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎEVEN SUCH A VIRTUOUS AND GUILELESS ASS WOULD LEARN AFTER A WHILE TO REACH FOR THAT FURCA OF HORACE TO NATURAM EXPELLERE: WITH WHAT SUCCESS? ‚ÄÚPLEBS‚ÄÙ USQUE RECURRET.19‚ÄÎ





265


AT THE RISK OF DISPLEASING INNOCENT EARS I PROPOSE: EGOISM BELONGS TO THE NATURE OF A NOBLE SOUL‚ÄÎI MEAN THAT UNSHAKABLE FAITH THAT TO A BEING SUCH AS ‚ÄÚWE ARE‚ÄÙ OTHER BEINGS MUST BE SUBORDINATE BY NATURE AND HAVE TO SACRIFICE THEMSELVES. THE NOBLE SOUL ACCEPTS THIS FACT OF ITS EGOISM WITHOUT ANY QUESTION MARK, ALSO WITHOUT ANY FEELING THAT IT MIGHT CONTAIN HARDNESS, CONSTRAINT, OR CAPRICE, RATHER AS SOMETHING THAT MAY BE FOUNDED IN THE PRIMORDIAL LAW OF THINGS: IF IT SOUGHT A NAME FOR THIS FACT IT WOULD SAY, ‚ÄÚIT IS JUSTICE ITSELF.‚ÄÙ PERHAPS IT ADMITS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT AT FIRST MAKE IT HESITATE THAT THERE ARE SOME WHO HAVE RIGHTS EQUAL TO ITS OWN; AS SOON AS THIS MATTER OF RANK IS SETTLED IT MOVES AMONG THESE EQUALS WITH THEIR EQUAL PRIVILEGES, SHOWING THE SAME SURENESS OF MODESTY AND DELICATE REVERENCE THAT CHARACTERIZE ITS RELATIONS WITH ITSELF‚ÄÎIN ACCORDANCE WITH AN INNATE HEAVENLY MECHANISM UNDERSTOOD BY ALL STARS. IT IS MERELY ANOTHER ASPECT OF ITS EGOISM, THIS REFINEMENT AND SELF-LIMITATION IN ITS RELATIONS WITH ITS EQUALS‚ÄÎEVERY STAR IS SUCH AN EGOIST‚ÄÎIT HONORS ITSELF IN THEM AND IN THE RIGHTS IT CEDES TO THEM; IT DOES NOT DOUBT THAT THE EXCHANGE OF HONORS AND RIGHTS IS OF THE NATURE OF ALL SOCIAL RELATIONS AND THUS ALSO BELONGS TO THE NATURAL CONDITION OF THINGS.

THE NOBLE SOUL GIVES AS IT TAKES, FROM THAT PASSIONATE AND IRRITABLE INSTINCT OF REPAYMENT THAT LIES IN ITS DEPTH. THE CONCEPT ‚ÄÚGRACE‚ÄÙ20 HAS NO MEANING OR GOOD ODOR INTER PARES;21 THERE MAY BE A SUBLIME WAY OF LETTING PRESENTS FROM ABOVE HAPPEN TO ONE, AS IT WERE, AND TO DRINK THEM UP THIRSTILY LIKE DROPS‚ÄÎBUT FOR THIS ART AND GESTURE THE NOBLE SOUL HAS NO APTITUDE. ITS EGOISM HINDERS IT: QUITE GENERALLY IT DOES NOT LIKE TO LOOK ‚ÄÚUP‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎBUT EITHER AHEAD, HORIZONTALLY AND SLOWLY, OR DOWN: IT KNOWS ITSELF TO BE AT A HEIGHT.





266


‚ÄÚTRULY HIGH RESPECT ONE CAN HAVE ONLY FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT SEEK THEMSELVES.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎGOETHE TO RAT SCHLOSSER.





267


THE CHINESE HAVE A PROVERB THAT MOTHERS EVEN TEACH CHILDREN: SIAO-SIN‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚMAKE YOUR HEART SMALL!‚ÄÙ THIS IS THE CHARACTERISTIC FUNDAMENTAL PROPENSITY IN LATE CIVILIZATIONS: I DO NOT DOUBT THAT AN ANCIENT GREEK WOULD RECOGNIZE IN US EUROPEANS OF TODAY, TOO, SUCH SELF-DIMINUTION; THIS ALONE WOULD SUFFICE FOR US TO ‚ÄÚOFFEND HIS TASTE.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎ





268


WHAT, IN THE END, IS COMMON?22

WORDS ARE ACOUSTICAL SIGNS FOR CONCEPTS; CONCEPTS, HOWEVER, ARE MORE OR LESS DEFINITE IMAGE SIGNS FOR OFTEN RECURRING AND ASSOCIATED SENSATIONS, FOR GROUPS OF SENSATIONS. TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER, IT IS NOT ENOUGH THAT ONE USE THE SAME WORDS; ONE ALSO HAS TO USE THE SAME WORDS FOR THE SAME SPECIES OF INNER EXPERIENCES; IN THE END ONE HAS TO HAVE ONE‚ÄÔS EXPERIENCE IN COMMON.

THEREFORE THE HUMAN BEINGS OF ONE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER BETTER THAN THOSE BELONGING TO DIFFERENT PEOPLES EVEN IF THEY EMPLOY THE SAME LANGUAGE; OR RATHER WHEN HUMAN BEINGS HAVE LONG LIVED TOGETHER UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS (OF CLIMATE, SOIL, DANGER, NEEDS, AND WORK), WHAT RESULTS23 FROM THIS IS PEOPLE WHO ‚ÄÚUNDERSTAND24 ONE ANOTHER‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎA PEOPLE. IN ALL SOULS AN EQUAL NUMBER OF OFTEN RECURRING EXPERIENCES HAS COME TO BE PREDOMINANT OVER EXPERIENCES THAT COME MORE RARELY: ON THE BASIS OF THE FORMER ONE UNDERSTANDS THE OTHER, QUICKLY AND EVER MORE QUICKLY‚ÄÎTHE HISTORY OF LANGUAGE IS THE HISTORY OF A PROCESS OF ABBREVIATION‚ÄÎAND ON THE BASIS OF SUCH QUICK UNDERSTANDING ONE ASSOCIATES, EVER MORE CLOSELY.

THE GREATER THE DANGER IS, THE GREATER IS THE NEED TO REACH AGREEMENT QUICKLY AND EASILY ABOUT WHAT MUST BE DONE; NOT MISUNDERSTANDING ONE ANOTHER IN TIMES OF DANGER IS WHAT HUMAN BEINGS SIMPLY CANNOT DO WITHOUT IN THEIR RELATIONS. IN EVERY FRIENDSHIP OR LOVE AFFAIR ONE STILL MAKES THIS TEST: NOTHING OF THAT SORT CAN ENDURE ONCE ONE DISCOVERS THAT ONE‚ÄÔS PARTNER ASSOCIATES DIFFERENT FEELINGS, INTENTIONS, NUANCES, DESIRES, AND FEARS WITH THE SAME WORDS. (FEAR OF THE ‚ÄÚETERNAL MISUNDERSTANDING‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT IS THE BENEVOLENT GENIUS WHICH SO OFTEN KEEPS PERSONS OF DIFFERENT SEX FROM RASH ATTACHMENTS TO WHICH THEIR SENSES AND HEARTS PROMPT THEM‚ÄÎTHIS AND NOT SOME SCHPPENHAUERIAN ‚ÄÚGENIUS OF THE SPECIES‚ÄÙ!)

WHICH GROUP OF SENSATIONS IS AROUSED, EXPRESSES ITSELF, AND ISSUES COMMANDS IN A SOUL MOST QUICKLY, IS DECISIVE FOR THE WHOLE ORDER OF RANK OF ITS VALUES AND ULTIMATELY DETERMINES ITS TABLE OF GOODS. THE VALUES OF A HUMAN BEING BETRAY SOMETHING OF THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SOUL AND WHERE IT FINDS ITS CONDITIONS OF LIFE, ITS TRUE NEED.

ASSUMING NEXT THAT NEED HAS EVER BROUGHT CLOSE TO ONE ANOTHER ONLY SUCH HUMAN BEINGS AS COULD SUGGEST WITH SIMILAR SIGNS SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS AND EXPERIENCES, IT WOULD FOLLOW ON THE WHOLE THAT EASY COMMUNICABILITY OF NEED‚ÄÎWHICH IN THE LAST ANALYSIS MEANS THE EXPERIENCE OF MERELY AVERAGE AND COMMON EXPERIENCES‚ÄÎMUST HAVE BEEN THE MOST POWERFUL OF ALL POWERS AT WHOSE DISPOSAL MAN HAS BEEN SO FAR. THE HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE MORE SIMILAR, MORE ORDINARY, HAVE HAD, AND ALWAYS HAVE, AN ADVANTAGE; THOSE MORE SELECT, SUBTLE, STRANGE, AND DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND, EASILY REMAIN ALONE, SUCCUMB TO ACCIDENTS, BEING ISOLATED, AND RARELY PROPAGATE. ONE MUST INVOKE TREMENDOUS COUNTER-FORCES IN ORDER TO CROSS THIS NATURAL, ALL TOO NATURAL PROGRESSUS IN SIMILE, THE CONTINUAL DEVELOPMENT OF MAN TOWARD THE SIMILAR, ORDINARY, AVERAGE, HERDLIKE‚ÄÎCOMMON!

THE MORE A PSYCHOLOGIST‚ÄÎA BORN AND INEVITABLE PSYCHOLOGIST AND UNRIDDLER OF SOULS‚ÄÎAPPLIES HIMSELF TO THE MORE EXQUISITE CASES AND HUMAN BEINGS, THE GREATER BECOMES THE DANGER THAT HE MIGHT SUFFOCATE FROM PITY.25 HE NEEDS HARDNESS AND CHEERFULNESS MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE. FOR THE CORRUPTION, THE RUINATION OF THE HIGHER MEN, OF THE SOULS OF A STRANGER TYPE, IS THE RULE: IT IS TERRIBLE TO HAVE SUCH A RULE ALWAYS BEFORE ONE‚ÄÔS EYES. THE MANIFOLD TORTURE OF THE PSYCHOLOGIST WHO HAS DISCOVERED THIS RUINATION, WHO DISCOVERS THIS WHOLE INNER HOPELESSNESS OF THE HIGHER MAN, THIS ETERNAL ‚ÄÚTOO LATE‚ÄÙ IN EVERY SENSE, FIRST IN ONE CASE AND THEN ALMOST ALWAYS THROUGH THE WHOLE OF HISTORY‚ÄÎMAY PERHAPS LEAD HIM ONE DAY TO TURN AGAINST HIS OWN LOT, EMBITTERED, AND TO MAKE AN ATTEMPT AT SELF-DESTRUCTION‚ÄÎMAY LEAD TO HIS OWN ‚ÄÚCORRUPTION.‚ÄÙ

IN ALMOST EVERY PSYCHOLOGIST ONE WILL PERCEIVE A TELLTALE PREFERENCE FOR AND DELIGHT IN ASSOCIATION WITH EVERYDAY, WELL-ORDERED PEOPLE: THIS REVEALS THAT HE ALWAYS REQUIRES A CURE, THAT HE NEEDS A KIND OF ESCAPE AND FORGETTING, AWAY FROM ALL THAT WITH WHICH HIS INSIGHTS, HIS INCISIONS, HIS ‚ÄÚCRAFT‚ÄÙ HAVE BURDENED HIS CONSCIENCE. HE IS CHARACTERIZED BY FEAR OF HIS MEMORY. HE IS EASILY SILENCED BY THE JUDGMENTS OF OTHERS; HE LISTENS WITH AN IMMOBILE FACE AS THEY VENERATE, ADMIRE, LOVE, AND TRANSFIGURE WHERE HE HAS SEEN‚ÄÎOR HE EVEN CONCEALS HIS SILENCE BY EXPRESSLY AGREEING WITH SOME FOREGROUND OPINION. PERHAPS THE PARADOX OF HIS SITUATION IS SO GRUESOME THAT PRECISELY WHERE HE HAS LEARNED THE GREATEST PITY COUPLED WITH THE GREATEST CONTEMPT, THE CROWD, THE EDUCATED, THE ENTHUSIASTS LEARN THE GREATEST VENERATION‚ÄÎTHE VENERATION FOR ‚ÄÚGREAT MEN‚ÄÙ AND PRODIGIES FOR WHOSE SAKE ONE BLESSES AND HONORS THE FATHERLAND, THE EARTH, THE DIGNITY OF HUMANITY, AND ONESELF, AND TO WHOM ONE REFERS THE YOUNG, TOWARD WHOM ONE EDUCATES THEM‚ÄÎ

AND WHO KNOWS WHETHER WHAT HAPPENED IN ALL GREAT CASES SO FAR WAS NOT ALWAYS THE SAME: THAT THE CROWD ADORED A GOD‚ÄÎAND THAT THE ‚ÄÚGOD‚ÄÙ WAS MERELY A POOR SACRIFICIAL ANIMAL. SUCCESS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE GREATEST LIAR‚ÄÎAND THE ‚ÄÚWORK‚ÄÙ ITSELF IS A SUCCESS; THE GREAT STATESMAN, THE CONQUEROR, THE DISCOVERER IS DISGUISED BY HIS CREATIONS, OFTEN BEYOND RECOGNITION; THE ‚ÄÚWORK,‚ÄÙ WHETHER OF THE ARTIST OR THE PHILOSOPHER, INVENTS THE MAN WHO HAS CREATED IT, WHO IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE CREATED IT; ‚ÄÚGREAT MEN,‚ÄÙ AS THEY ARE VENERATED, ARE SUBSEQUENT PIECES OF WRETCHED MINOR FICTION; IN THE WORLD OF HISTORICAL VALUES, COUNTERFEIT RULES.

THOSE GREAT POETS, FOR EXAMPLE‚ÄÎMEN LIKE BYRON, MUSSET, POE, LEOPARDI, KLEIST, GOGOL (I DO NOT DARE MENTION GREATER NAMES, BUT I MEAN THEM)26‚ÄÎARE AND PERHAPS MUST BE MEN OF FLEETING MOMENTS, ENTHUSIASTIC, SENSUAL, CHILDISH, FRIVOLOUS AND SUDDEN IN MISTRUST AND TRUST; WITH SOULS IN WHICH THEY USUALLY TRY TO CONCEAL SOME FRACTURE; OFTEN TAKING REVENGE WITH THEIR WORKS FOR SOME INNER CONTAMINATION, OFTEN SEEKING WITH THEIR HIGH FLIGHTS TO ESCAPE INTO FORGETFULNESS FROM AN ALL-TOO-FAITHFUL MEMORY; OFTEN LOST IN THE MUD AND ALMOST IN LOVE WITH IT, UNTIL THEY BECOME LIKE THE WILL-O‚ÄÔ-THE-WISPS AROUND SWAMPS AND POSE AS STARS‚ÄÎTHE PEOPLE MAY THEN CALL THEM IDEALISTS‚ÄÎOFTEN FIGHTING AGAINST A LONG NAUSEA, WITH A RECURRING SPECTER OF UNBELIEF THAT CHILLS AND FORCES THEM TO LANGUISH FOR GLORIA AND TO GOBBLE THEIR ‚ÄÚBELIEF IN THEMSELVES‚ÄÙ FROM THE HANDS OF INTOXICATED FLATTERERS‚ÄÎWHAT TORTURE ARE THESE GREAT ARTISTS AND ALL THE SO-CALLED HIGHER MEN FOR ANYONE WHO HAS ONCE GUESSED THEIR TRUE NATURE!27

IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE MEN SHOULD SO READILY RECEIVE FROM WOMAN‚ÄÎCLAIRVOYANT IN THE WORLD OF SUFFERING AND, UNFORTUNATELY, ALSO DESIROUS FAR BEYOND HER STRENGTH TO HELP AND SAVE‚ÄÎTHOSE ERUPTIONS OF BOUNDLESS AND MOST DEVOTED PITY WHICH THE MULTITUDE, ABOVE ALL THE VENERATING MULTITUDE, DOES NOT UNDERSTAND AND ON WHICH IT LAVISHES INQUISITIVE AND SELF-SATISFIED INTERPRETATIONS. THIS PITY DECEIVES ITSELF REGULARLY ABOUT ITS POWERS; WOMAN WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT LOVE CAN ACHIEVE ANYTHING‚ÄÎTHAT IS HER CHARACTERISTIC FAITH. ALAS, WHOEVER KNOWS THE HEART WILL GUESS HOW POOR, STUPID, HELPLESS, ARROGANT, BLUNDERING, MORE APT TO DESTROY THAN TO SAVE IS EVEN THE BEST AND PROFOUNDEST LOVE!

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT UNDERNEATH THE HOLY FABLE AND DISGUISE OF JESUS‚ÄÔ LIFE THERE LIES CONCEALED ONE OF THE MOST PAINFUL CASES OF THE MARTYRDOM OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LOVE: THE MARTYRDOM OF THE MOST INNOCENT AND DESIROUS HEART, NEVER SATED BY ANY HUMAN LOVE; DEMANDING LOVE, TO BE LOVED AND NOTHING ELSE, WITH HARDNESS, WITH INSANITY, WITH TERRIBLE ERUPTIONS AGAINST THOSE WHO DENIED HIM LOVE; THE STORY OF A POOR FELLOW, UNSATED AND INSATIABLE IN LOVE, WHO HAD TO INVENT HELL IN ORDER TO SEND TO IT THOSE WHO DID NOT WANT TO LOVE HIM‚ÄÎAND WHO FINALLY, HAVING GAINED KOWLEDGE ABOUT HUMAN LOVE, HAD TO INVENT A GOD WHO IS ALL LOVE, ALL ABILITY TO LOVE‚ÄÎWHO HAS MERCY ON HUMAN LOVE BECAUSE IT IS SO UTTERLY WRETCHED AND UNKNOWING. ANYONE WHO FEELS THAT WAY, WHO KNOWS THIS ABOUT LOVE‚ÄÎSEEKS DEATH.

BUT WHY PURSUE SUCH PAINFUL MATTERS? ASSUMING ONE DOES NOT HAVE TO.‚ÄÎ





270


THE SPIRITUAL HAUGHTINESS AND NAUSEA OF EVERY MAN WHO HAS SUFFERED PROFOUNDLY‚ÄÎIT ALMOST DETERMINES THE ORDER OF RANK HOW PROFOUNDLY HUMAN BEINGS CAN SUFFER‚ÄÎHIS SHUDDERING CERTAINTY, WHICH PERMEATES AND COLORS HIM THROUGH AND THROUGH, THAT BY VIRTUE OF HIS SUFFERING HE KNOWS MORE THAN THE CLEVEREST AND WISEST COULD POSSIBLY KNOW, AND THAT HE KNOWS HIS WAY AND HAS ONCE BEEN ‚ÄÚAT HOME‚ÄÙ IN MANY DISTANT, TERRIFYING WORLDS OF WHICH ‚ÄÚYOU KNOW NOTHING‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHIS SPIRITUAL AND SILENT HAUGHTINESS OF THE SUFFERER, THIS PRIDE OF THE ELECT OF KNOWLEDGE, OF THE ‚ÄÚINITIATED,‚ÄÙ OF THE ALMOST SACRIFICED, FINDS ALL KINDS OF DISGUISES NECESSARY TO PROTECT ITSELF AGAINST CONTACT WITH OBTRUSIVE AND PITYING HANDS AND ALTOGETHER AGAINST EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT ITS EQUAL IN SUFFERING. PROFOUND SUFFERING MAKES NOBLE; IT SEPARATES.

ONE OF THE MOST REFINED DISGUISES IS EPICUREANISM, AND A CERTAIN OSTENTATIOUS COURAGE OF TASTE WHICH TAKES SUFFERING CASUALLY AND RESISTS EVERYTHING SAD AND PROFOUND. THERE ARE ‚ÄÚCHEERFUL PEOPLE‚ÄÙ WHO EMPLOY CHEERFULNESS BECAUSE THEY ARE MISUNDERSTOOD ON ITS ACCOUNT‚ÄÎTHEY WANT TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD. THERE ARE ‚ÄÚSCIENTIFIC MEN‚ÄÙ WHO EMPLOY SCIENCE BECAUSE IT CREATES A CHEERFUL APPEARANCE, AND BECAUSE BEING SCIENTIFIC SUGGESTS THAT A HUMAN BEING IS SUPERFICIAL‚ÄÎTHEY WANT TO SEDUCE OTHERS TO THIS FALSE INFERENCE. THERE ARE FREE, INSOLENT SPIRITS WHO WOULD LIKE TO CONCEAL AND DENY THAT THEY ARE BROKEN, PROUD, INCURABLE HEARTS (THE CYNICISM OF HAMLET‚ÄÎTHE CASE OF GALIANI);28 AND OCCASIONALLY EVEN FOOLISHNESS IS THE MASK FOR AN UNBLESSED ALL-TOO-CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE.

FROM WHICH IT FOLLOWS THAT IT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF MORE REFINED HUMANITY TO RESPECT ‚ÄÚTHE MASK‚ÄÙ AND NOT TO INDULGE IN PSYCHOLOGY AND CURIOSITY IN THE WRONG PLACE.





271


WHAT SEPARATES TWO PEOPLE MOST PROFOUNDLY IS A DIFFERENT SENSE AND DEGREE OF CLEANLINESS. WHAT AVAILS ALL DECENCY AND MUTUAL USEFULNESS AND GOOD WILL TOWARD EACH OTHER‚ÄÎIN THE END THE FACT REMAINS: ‚ÄÚTHEY CAN‚ÄÔT STAND EACH OTHER‚ÄÔS SMELL!‚ÄÙ

THE HIGHEST INSTINCT OF CLEANLINESS PLACES THOSE POSSESSED OF IT IN THE ODDEST AND MOST DANGEROUS LONESOMENESS, AS SAINTS: FOR PRECISELY THIS IS SAINTLINESS‚ÄÎTHE HIGHEST SPIRITUALIZATION OF THIS INSTINCT. WHETHER ONE IS PRIVY TO SOMEONE‚ÄÔS INDESCRIBABLE ABUNDANCE OF PLEASURE IN THE BATH, OR WHETHER ONE FEELS SOME ARDOR AND THIRST THAT CONSTANTLY DRIVES THE SOUL OUT OF THE NIGHT INTO THE MORNING AND OUT OF THE DIM AND ‚ÄÚDARK MOODS‚ÄÙ INTO WHAT IS BRIGHT, BRILLIANT, PROFOUND, AND REFINED‚ÄÎJUST AS SUCH A PROPENSITY DISTINGUISHES‚ÄÎIT IS A NOBLE PROPENSITY‚ÄÎIT ALSO SEPARATES.

THE SAINT‚ÄÔS PITY IS PITY WITH THE DIRT OF WHAT IS HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMAN. AND THERE ARE DEGREES AND HEIGHTS WHERE HE EXPERIENCES EVEN PITY ITSELF AS A POLLUTION, AS DIRTY‚ÄÎ





272


SIGNS OF NOBILITY: NEVER THINKING OF DEGRADING OUR DUTIES INTO DUTIES FOR EVERYBODY; NOT WANTING TO DELEGATE, TO SHARE, ONE‚ÄÔS OWN RESPONSIBILITY; COUNTING ONE‚ÄÔS PRIVILEGES AND THEIR EXERCISE AMONG ONE‚ÄÔS DUTIES.





273


A HUMAN BEING WHO STRIVES FOR SOMETHING GREAT CONSIDERS EVERYONE HE MEETS ON HIS WAY EITHER AS A MEANS OR AS A DELAY AND OBSTACLE‚ÄÎOR AS A TEMPORARY RESTING PLACE. HIS CHARACTERISTIC HIGH-GRADE GRACIOUSNESS TOWARD HIS FELLOW MEN BECOMES POSSIBLE ONLY ONCE HE HAS ATTAINED HIS HEIGHT AND RULES. IMPATIENCE AND HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT UNTIL THEN HE IS ALWAYS CONDEMNED TO COMEDY‚ÄÎFOR EVEN WAR IS A COMEDY AND CONCEALS, JUST AS EVERY MEANS CONCEALS THE END‚ÄÎSPOIL ALL OF HIS RELATIONS TO OTHERS: THIS TYPE OF MAN KNOWS SOLITUDE AND WHAT IS MOST POISONOUS IN IT.





274


THE PROBLEM OF THOSE WHO ARE WAITING.‚ÄÎIT REQUIRES STROKES OF LUCK AND MUCH THAT IS INCALCULABLE IF A HIGHER MAN IN WHOM THE SOLUTION OF A PROBLEM LIES DORMANT IS TO GET AROUND TO ACTION IN TIME‚ÄÎTO ‚ÄÚERUPTION,‚ÄÙ ONE MIGHT SAY. IN THE AVERAGE CASE IT DOES NOT HAPPEN, AND IN NOOKS ALL OVER THE EARTH SIT MEN WHO ARE WAITING, SCARCELY KNOWING IN WHAT WAY THEY ARE WAITING, MUCH LESS THAT THEY ARE WAITING IN VAIN. OCCASIONALLY THE CALL THAT AWAKENS‚ÄÎTHAT ACCIDENT WHICH GIVES THE ‚ÄÚPERMISSION‚ÄÙ TO ACT‚ÄÎCOMES TOO LATE, WHEN THE BEST YOUTH AND STRENGTH FOR ACTION HAS ALREADY BEEN USED UP BY SITTING STILL; AND MANY HAVE FOUND TO THEIR HORROR WHEN THEY ‚ÄÚLEAPED UP‚ÄÙ THAT THEIR LIMBS HAD GONE TO SLEEP AND THEIR SPIRIT HAD BECOME TOO HEAVY. ‚ÄÚIT IS TOO LATE,‚ÄÙ THEY SAID TO THEMSELVES, HAVING LOST THEIR FAITH IN THEMSELVES AND HENCEFORTH FOREVER USELESS.

COULD IT BE THAT IN THE REALM OF THE SPIRIT ‚ÄÚRAPHAEL WITHOUT HANDS,‚ÄÙ TAKING THIS PHRASE IN THE WIDEST SENSE, IS PERHAPS NOT THE EXCEPTION BUT THE RULE? 29

GENIUS IS PERHAPS NOT SO RARE AFTER ALL‚ÄÎBUT THE FIVE HUNDRED HANDS IT REQUIRES TO TYRANNIZE THE KAIROS, ‚ÄÚTHE RIGHT TIME,‚ÄÙ SEIZING CHANCE BY ITS FORELOCK.





275


ANYONE WHO DOES NOT WANT TO SEE WHAT IS LOFTY IN A MAN LOOKS THAT MUCH MORE KEENLY FOR WHAT IS LOW IN HIM AND MERE FOREGROUND‚ÄÎAND THUS BETRAYS HIMSELF.





276


IN ALL KINDS OF INJURY AND LOSS THE LOWER AND COARSER SOUL IS BETTER OFF THAN THE NOBLER ONE: THE DANGERS FOR THE LATTER MUST BE GREATER; THE PROBABILITY THAT IT WILL COME TO GRIEF AND PERISH IS ACTUALLY, IN VIEW OF THE MULTIPLICITY OF THE CONDITIONS OF ITS LIFE, TREMENDOUS.

IN A LIZARD A LOST FINGER IS REPLACED AGAIN; NOT SO IN MAN.





277


‚ÄÎBAD ENOUGH! THE SAME OLD STORY! WHEN ONE HAS FINISHED BUILDING ONES‚ÄÔ HOUSE, ONE SUDDENLY REALIZES THAT IN THE PROCESS ONE HAS LEARNED SOMETHING THAT ONE REALLY NEEDED TO KNOW IN THE WORST WAY‚ÄÎBEFORE ONE BEGAN. THE ETERNAL DISTASTEFUL ‚ÄÚTOO LATE!‚ÄÙ

THE MELANCHOLY OF EVERYTHING FINISHED!30‚ÄÎ





278


WANDERER, WHO ARE YOU? I SEE YOU WALKING ON YOUR WAY WITHOUT SCORN, WITHOUT LOVE, WITH UNFATHOMABLE EYES; MOIST AND SAD LIKE A SOUNDING LEAD THAT HAS RETURNED TO THE LIGHT, UNSATED, FROM EVERY DEPTH‚ÄÎWHAT DID IT SEEK DOWN THERE?‚ÄÎWITH A BREAST THAT DOES NOT SIGH, WITH A LIP THAT CONCEALS ITS DISGUST, WITH A HAND THAT NOW REACHES ONLY SLOWLY: WHO ARE YOU? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? REST HERE: THIS SPOT IS HOSPITABLE TO ALL‚ÄÎRECUPERATE! AND WHOEVER YOU MAY BE: WHAT DO YOU LIKE NOW? WHAT DO YOU NEED FOR RECREATION? NAME IT: WHATEVER I HAVE I OFFER TO YOU!

‚ÄÚRECREATION? RECREATION? YOU ARE INQUISITIVE! WHAT ARE YOU SAYING! BUT GIVE ME, PLEASE‚ÄÎ‚ÄÙ

WHAT? WHAT? SAY IT!

‚ÄÚANOTHER MASK! A SECOND MASK!‚ÄÙ 31‚ÄÎ





279


MEN OF PROFOUND SADNESS BETRAY THEMSELVES WHEN THEY ARE HAPPY: THEY HAVE A WAY OF EMBRACING HAPPINESS AS IF THEY WANTED TO CRUSH AND SUFFOCATE IT, FROM JEALOUSY: ALAS, THEY KNOW ONLY TOO WELL THAT IT WILL FLEE.





280


‚ÄÚTOO BAD! WHAT? ISN‚ÄÔT HE GOING‚ÄÎBACK?‚ÄÙ

YES, BUT YOU UNDERSTAND HIM BADLY WHEN YOU COMPLAIN. HE IS GOING BACK LIKE ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO ATTEMPT A BIG JUMP.‚ÄÎ





281


‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚWILL PEOPLE BELIEVE ME? BUT I DEMAND THAT THEY SHOULD BELIEVE ME: I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT LITTLE AND BADLY OF MYSELF, ONLY ON VERY RARE OCCASIONS, ONLY WHEN I HAD TO, ALWAYS WITHOUT ANY DESIRE FOR ‚ÄÒTHIS SUBJECT,‚ÄÔ MORE THAN READY TO DIGRESS FROM ‚ÄÒMYSELF‚ÄÔ; ALWAYS WITHOUT FAITH IN THE RESULT, OWING TO AN UNCONQUERABLE MISTRUST OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE WHICH WENT SO FAR THAT EVEN IN THE CONCEPT OF ‚ÄÒIMMEDIATE KNOWLEDGE,‚ÄÔ WHICH THEORETICIANS PERMIT THEMSELVES, I SENSED A CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO: THIS WHOLE FACT IS ALMOST THE MOST CERTAIN THING I DO KNOW ABOUT MYSELF. THERE MUST BE A KIND OF AVERSION IN ME TO BELIEVING ANYTHING DEFINITE ABOUT MYSELF.

‚ÄÚDOES THIS PERHAPS POINT TO A RIDDLE? PROBABLY; BUT FORTUNATELY NONE FOR MY OWN TEETH.

‚ÄÚPERHAPS IT BETRAYS THE SPECIES TO WHICH I BELONG?

‚ÄÚBUT NOT TO ME‚ÄÎAND OF THAT I AM GLAD.‚ÄÙ





282


‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚBUT WHATEVER HAPPENED TO YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT KNOW,‚ÄÙ HE SAID HESITANTLY; ‚ÄÚPERHAPS THE HARPIES FLEW OVER MY TABLE.‚ÄÙ

NOWADAYS IT HAPPENS OCCASIONALLY THAT A MILD, MODERATE, RETICENT PERSON SUDDENLY GOES INTO A RAGE, SMASHES DISHES, UPENDS THE TABLE, SCREAMS, RAVES, INSULTS EVERYBODY‚ÄÎAND EVENTUALLY WALKS OFF, ASHAMED, FURIOUS WITH HIMSELF‚ÄÎWHERE? WHAT FOR? TO STARVE BY HIMSELF? TO SUFFOCATE ON HIS RECOLLECTION?

IF A PERSON HAS THE DESIRES OF A HIGH AND CHOOSY SOUL AND ONLY RARELY FINDS HIS TABLE SET AND HIS FOOD READY, HIS DANGER WILL BE GREAT AT ALL TIMES; BUT TODAY IT IS EXTRAORDINARY. THROWN INTO A NOISY AND PLEBEIAN AGE WITH WHICH HE DOES NOT CARE TO EAT OUT OF THE SAME DISHES, HE CAN EASILY PERISH OF HUNGER AND THIRST OR, IF EVENTUALLY HE ‚ÄÚFALLS TO‚ÄÙ AFTER ALL‚ÄÎOF SUDDEN NAUSEA.

PROBABLY ALL OF US HAVE SAT AT TABLES WHERE WE DID NOT BELONG; AND PRECISELY THE MOST SPIRITUAL AMONG US, BEING HARDEST TO NOURISH, KNOW THAT DANGEROUS DYSPEPSIA WHICH COMES OF A SUDDEN INSIGHT AND DISAPPOINTMENT ABOUT OUR FOOD AND OUR NEIGHBORS AT THE TABLE‚ÄÎTHE AFTER-DINNER NAUSEA.





283


IT INVOLVES SUBTLE AND AT THE SAME TIME NOBLE SELF-CONTROL, ASSUMING THAT ONE WANTS TO PRAISE AT ALL, IF ONE ALWAYS PRAISES ONLY WHERE ONE DOES NOT AGREE: FOR IN THE OTHER CASE ONE WOULD AFTER ALL PRAISE ONESELF, WHICH OFFENDS GOOD TASTE. STILL THIS KIND OF SELF-CONTROL FURNISHES A NEAT OCCASION AND PROVOCATION FOR CONSTANT MISUNDERSTANDINGS. TO BE IN A POSITION TO AFFORD THIS REAL LUXURY OF TASTE AND MORALITY, ONE MUST NOT LIVE AMONG DOLTS OF THE SPIRIT BUT RATHER AMONG PEOPLE WHOSE MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND BLUNDERS ARE STILL AMUSING OWING TO THEIR SUBTLETY‚ÄÎOR ONE WILL HAVE TO PAY DEARLY FOR IT!

‚ÄÚHE PRAISES ME: HENCE HE THINKS I AM RIGHT‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHIS ASININE INFERENCE SPOILS HALF OUR LIFE FOR US HERMITS, FOR IT LEADS ASSES TO SEEK OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND FRIENDSHIP.





284


TO LIVE WITH TREMENDOUS AND PROUD COMPOSURE; ALWAYS BEYOND‚ÄÎ. TO HAVE AND NOT TO HAVE ONE‚ÄÔS AFFECTS, ONE‚ÄÔS PRO AND CON, AT WILL; TO CONDESCEND TO THEM, FOR A FEW HOURS; TO SEAT ONESELF ON THEM AS ON A HORSE, OFTEN AS ON AN ASS‚ÄÎFOR ONE MUST KNOW HOW TO MAKE USE OF THEIR STUPIDITY AS MUCH AS OF THEIR FIRE. TO RESERVE ONE‚ÄÔS THREE HUNDRED FOREGROUNDS; ALSO THE DARK GLASSES; FOR THERE ARE CASES WHEN NOBODY MAY LOOK INTO OUR EYES, STILL LESS INTO OUR ‚ÄÚGROUNDS.‚ÄÙ AND TO CHOOSE FOR COMPANY THAT IMPISH AND CHEERFUL VICE, COURTESY. AND TO REMAIN MASTER OF ONE‚ÄÔS FOUR VIRTUES: OF COURAGE, INSIGHT, SYMPATHY, AND SOLITUDE.32 FOR SOLITUDE IS A VIRTUE FOR US, AS A SUBLIME BENT AND URGE FOR CLEANLINESS WHICH GUESSES HOW ALL CONTACT BETWEEN MAN AND MAN‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚIN SOCIETY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎINVOLVES INEVITABLE UNCLEANLINESS. ALL COMMUNITY MAKES MEN‚ÄÎSOMEHOW, SOMEWHERE, SOMETIME ‚ÄÚCOMMON.‚ÄÙ





285


THE GREATEST EVENTS AND THOUGHTS‚ÄÎBUT THE GREATEST THOUGHTS ARE THE GREATEST EVENTS‚ÄÎARE COMPREHENDED LAST: THE GENERATIONS THAT ARE CONTEMPORANEOUS WITH THEM DO NOT EXPERIENCE SUCH EVENTS‚ÄÎTHEY LIVE RIGHT PAST THEM. WHAT HAPPENS IS A LITTLE LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE REALM OF STARS. THE LIGHT OF THE REMOTEST STARS COMES LAST TO MEN; AND UNTIL IT HAS ARRIVED MAN DENIES THAT THERE ARE‚ÄÎSTARS THERE. ‚ÄÚHOW MANY CENTURIES DOES A SPIRIT REQUIRE TO BE COMPREHENDED?‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT IS A STANDARD, TOO; WITH THAT, TOO, ONE CREATES AN ORDER OF RANK AND ETIQUETTE THAT IS STILL NEEDED‚ÄÎFOR SPIRIT AND STAR.33





286


‚ÄÚHERE THE VISION IS FREE, THE SPIRIT EXALTED.‚ÄÙ 34

BUT THERE IS AN OPPOSITE TYPE OF MAN THAT IS ALSO ON A HEIGHT AND ALSO HAS FREE VISION‚ÄÎBUT LOOKS DOWN.





287


‚ÄÎWHAT IS NOBLE? WHAT DOES THE WORD ‚ÄÚNOBLE‚ÄÙ STILL MEAN TO US TODAY? WHAT BETRAYS, WHAT ALLOWS ONE TO RECOGNIZE THE NOBLE HUMAN BEING, UNDER THIS HEAVY, OVERCAST SKY OF THE BEGINNING RULE OF THE PLEBS THAT MAKES EVERYTHING OPAQUE AND LEADEN?

IT IS NOT ACTIONS THAT PROVE HIM‚ÄÎACTIONS ARE ALWAYS OPEN TO MANY INTERPRETATIONS, ALWAYS UNFATHOMABLE‚ÄÎNOR IS IT ‚ÄÚWORKS.‚ÄÙ AMONG ARTISTS AND SCHOLARS TODAY ONE FINDS ENOUGH OF THOSE WHO BETRAY BY THEIR WORKS HOW THEY ARE IMPELLED BY A PROFOUND DESIRE FOR WHAT IS NOBLE; BUT JUST THIS NEED FOR WHAT IS NOBLE IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE NEEDS OF THE NOBLE SOUL ITSELF AND ACTUALLY THE ELOQUENT AND DANGEROUS MARK OF ITS LACK. IT IS NOT THE WORKS, IT IS THE FAITH THAT IS DECISIVE HERE, THAT DETERMINES THE ORDER OF RANK‚ÄÎTO TAKE UP AGAIN AN ANCIENT RELIGIOUS FORMULA IN A NEW AND MORE PROFOUND SENSE: SOME FUNDAMENTAL CERTAINTY THAT A NOBLE SOUL HAS ABOUT ITSELF, SOMETHING THAT CANNOT BE SOUGHT, NOR FOUND, NOR PERHAPS LOST.

THE NOBLE SOUL HAS REVERENCE FOR ITSELF.35





288


THERE ARE HUMAN BEINGS WHO HAVE SPIRIT IN AN INEVITABLE WAY; THEY MAY TURN AND TWIST AS THEY PLEASE AND HOLD THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR GIVEAWAY EYES (AS IF A HAND DID NOT GIVE AWAY SECRETS!)‚ÄÎIN THE END IT ALWAYS WILL OUT THAT THEY HAVE SOMETHING THEY CONCEAL, NAMELY SPIRIT. ONE OF THE SUBTLEST MEANS FOR KEEPING UP THE DECEPTION AT LEAST AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND OF SUCCESSFULLY APPEARING MORE STUPID THAN ONE IS‚ÄÎWHICH IN ORDINARY LIFE IS OFTEN AS DESIRABLE AS AN UMBRELLA‚ÄÎIS CALLED ENTHUSIASM, IF WE INCLUDE WHAT BELONGS WITH IT; FOR EXAMPLE, VIRTUE. FOR AS GALIANI, WHO SHOULD KNOW, SAYS: VERTU EST ENTHOUSIASME.





289


IN THE WRITINGS36 OF A HERMIT ONE ALWAYS ALSO HEARS SOMETHING OF THE ECHO OF THE DESOLATE REGIONS, SOMETHING OF THE WHISPERED TONES AND THE FURTIVE LOOK OF SOLITUDE; IN HIS STRONGEST WORDS, EVEN IN HIS CRY, THERE STILL VIBRATES A NEW AND DANGEROUS KIND OF SILENCE‚ÄÎOF BURYING SOMETHING IN SILENCE. WHEN A MAN HAS BEEN SITTING ALONE WITH HIS SOUL IN CONFIDENTIAL DISCORD AND DISCOURSE, YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT, DAY AND NIGHT; WHEN IN HIS CAVE‚ÄÎIT MAY BE A LABYRINTH OR A GOLD MINE‚ÄÎHE HAS BECOME A CAVE BEAR OR A TREASURE DIGGER OR A TREASURE GUARD AND DRAGON; THEN EVEN HIS CONCEPTS EVENTUALLY ACQUIRE A PECULIAR TWILIGHT COLOR, AN ODOR JUST AS MUCH OF DEPTH AS OF MUST, SOMETHING INCOMMUNICABLE AND RECALCITRANT THAT BLOWS AT EVERY PASSERBY LIKE A CHILL.

THE HERMIT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY PHILOSOPHER‚ÄÎASSUMING THAT EVERY PHILOSOPHER WAS FIRST OF ALL A HERMIT‚ÄÎEVER EXPRESSED HIS REAL AND ULTIMATE OPINIONS IN BOOKS: DOES ONE NOT WRITE BOOKS PRECISELY TO CONCEAL WHAT ONE HARBORS? 37 INDEED, HE WILL DOUBT WHETHER A PHILOSOPHER COULD POSSIBLY HAVE ‚ÄÚULTIMATE AND REAL‚ÄÙ OPINIONS, WHETHER BEHIND EVERY ONE OF HIS CAVES THERE IS NOT, MUST NOT BE, ANOTHER DEEPER CAVE‚ÄÎA MORE COMPREHENSIVE, STRANGER, RICHER WORLD BEYOND THE SURFACE, AN ABYSMALLY DEEP GROUND BEHIND EVERY GROUND, UNDER EVERY ATTEMPT TO FURNISH ‚ÄÚGROUNDS.‚ÄÙ38 EVERY PHILOSOPHY IS A FOREGROUND PHILOSOPHY‚ÄÎTHAT IS A HERMIT‚ÄÔS JUDGMENT: ‚ÄÚTHERE IS SOMETHING ARBITRARY IN HIS STOPPING HERE TO LOOK BACK AND LOOK AROUND, IN HIS NOT DIGGING DEEPER HERE BUT LAYING HIS SPADE ASIDE; THERE IS ALSO SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS ABOUT IT.‚ÄÙ EVERY PHILOSOPHY ALSO CONCEALS A PHILOSOPHY; EVERY OPINION IS ALSO A HIDEOUT, EVERY WORD ALSO A MASK.





290


EVERY PROFOUND THINKER IS MORE AFRAID OF BEING UNDERSTOOD THAN OF BEING MISUNDERSTOOD. THE LATTER MAY HURT HIS VANITY, BUT THE FORMER HIS HEART, HIS SYMPATHY, WHICH ALWAYS SAYS: ‚ÄÚALAS, WHY DO YOU WANT TO HAVE AS HARD A TIME AS I DID?‚ÄÙ





291


MAN, A MANIFOLD, MENDACIOUS, ARTIFICIAL, AND OPAQUE ANIMAL, UNCANNY TO THE OTHER ANIMALS LESS BECAUSE OF HIS STRENGTH THAN BECAUSE OF HIS CUNNING AND SHREWDNESS, HAS INVENTED THE GOOD CONSCIENCE TO ENJOY HIS SOUL FOR ONCE AS SIMPLE; AND THE WHOLE OF MORALITY IS A LONG UNDISMAYED FORGERY WHICH ALONE MAKES IT AT ALL POSSIBLE TO ENJOY THE SIGHT OF THE SOUL. FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW MUCH MORE MAY BELONG IN THE CONCEPT OF ‚ÄÚART‚ÄÙ THAN IS GENERALLY BELIEVED.





292


A PHILOSOPHER‚ÄÎIS A HUMAN BEING WHO CONSTANTLY EXPERIENCES, SEES, HEARS, SUSPECTS, HOPES, AND DREAMS EXTRAORDINARY THINGS; WHO IS STRUCK BY HIS OWN THOUGHTS AS FROM OUTSIDE, AS FROM ABOVE AND BELOW, AS BY HIS TYPE OF EXPERIENCES AND LIGHTNING BOLTS; WHO IS PERHAPS HIMSELF A STORM PREGNANT WITH NEW LIGHTNINGS; A FATAL HUMAN BEING AROUND WHOM THERE ARE CONSTANT RUMBLINGS AND GROWLINGS, CREVICES, AND UNCANNY DOINGS. A PHILOSOPHER‚ÄÎALAS, A BEING THAT OFTEN RUNS AWAY FROM ITSELF, OFTEN IS AFRAID OF ITSELF‚ÄÎBUT TOO INQUISITIVE NOT TO ‚ÄÚCOME TO‚ÄÙ AGAIN‚ÄÎALWAYS BACK TO HIMSELF.





293


A MAN WHO SAYS, ‚ÄÚI LIKE THIS, I TAKE THIS FOR MY OWN AND WANT TO PROTECT IT AND DEFEND IT AGAINST ANYBODY;‚ÄÙ A MAN WHO IS ABLE TO MANAGE SOMETHING, TO CARRY OUT A RESOLUTION, TO REMAIN FAITHFUL TO A THOUGHT, TO HOLD A WOMAN, TO PUNISH AND PROSTRATE ONE WHO PRESUMED TOO MUCH; A MAN WHO HAS HIS WRATH AND HIS SWORD AND TO WHOM THE WEAK, THE SUFFERING, THE HARD PRESSED, AND THE ANIMALS, TOO, LIKE TO COME39 AND BELONG BY NATURE, IN SHORT A MAN WHO IS BY NATURE A MASTER‚ÄÎWHEN SUCH A MAN HAS PITY, WELL, THIS PITY HAS VALUE. BUT WHAT GOOD IS THE PITY OF THOSE WHO SUFFER. OR THOSE WHO, WORSE, PREACH PITY.

ALMOST EVERYWHERE IN EUROPE TODAY WE FIND A PATHOLOGICAL SENSITIVITY AND RECEPTIVITY TO PAIN; ALSO A REPULSIVE INCONTINENCE IN LAMENTATION, AN INCREASE IN TENDERNESS THAT WOULD USE RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHICAL BRIC-A-BRAC TO DECK ITSELF OUT AS SOMETHING HIGHER‚ÄÎTHERE IS A VERITABLE CULT OF SUFFERING. THE UNMANLINESS OF WHAT IS BAPTIZED AS ‚ÄÚPITY‚ÄÙ IN THE CIRCLES OF SUCH ENTHUSIASTS IS, I SHOULD THINK, WHAT ALWAYS MEETS THE EYE FIRST.

THIS NEWEST KIND OF BAD TASTE SHOULD BE EXORCIZED VIGOROUSLY AND THOROUGHLY; AND I FINALLY WISH THAT ONE MIGHT PLACE AROUND ONE‚ÄÔS HEART AND NECK THE GOOD AMULET ‚ÄÚGAI SABER‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚGAY SCIENCE,‚ÄÙ TO MAKE IT PLAIN TO THE PLAIN.40





294


THE OLYMPIAN VICE.‚ÄÎIN DESPITE OF THAT PHILOSOPHER WHO, BEING A REAL ENGLISHMAN, TRIED TO BRING LAUGHTER INTO ILL REPUTE AMONG ALL THINKING MEN‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚLAUGHING IS A BAD INFIRMITY OF HUMAN NATURE, WHICH EVERY THINKING MIND WILL STRIVE TO OVERCOME‚ÄÙ (HOBBES)41‚ÄÎI SHOULD ACTUALLY RISK AN ORDER OF RANK AMONG PHILOSOPHERS DEPENDING ON THE RANK OF THEIR LAUGHTER‚ÄÎALL THE WAY UP TO THOSE CAPABLE OF GOLDEN LAUGHTER. AND SUPPOSING THAT GODS, TOO, PHILOSOPHIZE, WHICH HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO ME BY MANY AN INFERENCE‚ÄÎI SHOULD NOT DOUBT THAT THEY ALSO KNOW HOW TO LAUGH THE WHILE IN A SUPERHUMAN AND NEW WAY‚ÄÎAND AT THE EXPENSE OF ALL SERIOUS THINGS. GODS ENJOY MOCKERY: IT SEEMS THEY CANNOT SUPPRESS LAUGHTER EVEN DURING HOLY RITES.

THE GENIUS OF THE HEART, AS THAT GREAT CONCEALED ONE POSSESSES IT, THE TEMPTER GOD42 AND BORN PIED PIPER OF CONSCIENCES WHOSE VOICE KNOWS HOW TO DESCEND INTO THE NETHERWORLD OF EVERY SOUL; WHO DOES NOT SAY A WORD OR CAST A GLANCE IN WHICH THERE IS NO CONSIDERATION AND ULTERIOR ENTICEMENT; WHOSE MASTERY INCLUDES THE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO SEEM‚ÄÎNOT WHAT HE IS BUT WHAT IS TO THOSE WHO FOLLOW HIM ONE MORE CONSTRAINT TO PRESS EVER CLOSER TO HIM IN ORDER TO FOLLOW HIM EVER MORE INWARDLY AND THOROUGHLY‚ÄÎTHE GENIUS OF THE HEART WHO SILENCES ALL THAT IS LOUD AND SELF-SATISFIED, TEACHING IT TO LISTEN; WHO SMOOTHS ROUGH SOULS AND LETS THEM TASTE A NEW DESIRE‚ÄÎTO LIE STILL AS A MIRROR, THAT THE DEEP SKY MAY MIRROR ITSELF IN THEM‚ÄÎTHE GENIUS OF THE HEART WHO TEACHES THE DOLTISH AND RASH HAND TO HESITATE AND REACH OUT MORE DELICATELY; WHO GUESSES THE CONCEALED AND FORGOTTEN TREASURE, THE DROP OF GRACIOUSNESS AND SWEET SPIRITUALITY TINDER DIM AND THICK ICE, AND IS A DIVINING ROD FOR EVERY GRAIN OF GOLD THAT HAS LONG LAIN BURIED IN THE DUNGEON OF MUCH MUD AND SAND; THE GENIUS OF THE HEART FROM WHOSE TOUCH EVERYONE WALKS AWAY RICHER, NOT HAVING RECEIVED GRACE AND SURPRISED, NOT AS BLESSED AND OPPRESSED BY ALIEN GOODS, BUT RICHER IN HIMSELF, NEWER TO HIMSELF THAN BEFORE, BROKEN OPEN, BLOWN AT AND SOUNDED OUT BY A THAWING WIND, PERHAPS MORE UNSURE, TENDERER, MORE FRAGILE, MORE BROKEN, BUT FULL OF HOPES THAT AS YET HAVE NO NAME, FULL OF NEW WILL AND CURRENTS, FULL OF NEW DISSATISFACTION AND UNDERTOWS‚ÄÎBUT WHAT AM I DOING, MY FRIENDS? 43

OF WHOM AM I SPEAKING TO YOU? HAVE I FORGOTTEN MYSELF SO FAR THAT I HAVE NOT EVEN TOLD YOU HIS NAME? UNLESS YOU HAVE GUESSED BY YOURSELVES WHO THIS QUESTIONABLE SPIRIT AND GOD IS WHO WANTS TO BE PRAISED IN SUCH FASHION. FOR JUST AS HAPPENS TO EVERYONE WHO FROM CHILDHOOD HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON HIS WAY AND IN FOREIGN PARTS, MANY STRANGE AND NOT UNDANGEROUS SPIRITS HAVE CROSSED MY PATH, TOO, BUT ABOVE ALL HE OF WHOM I WAS SPEAKING JUST NOW, AND HE AGAIN AND AGAIN‚ÄÎNAMELY, NO LESS A ONE THAN THE GOD DIONYSUS, THAT GREAT AMBIGUOUS ONE AND TEMPTER GOD TO WHOM I ONCE OFFERED, AS YOU KNOW, IN ALL SECRECY AND REVERENCE, MY FIRST-BORN‚ÄÎAS BORN‚ÄÎAS THE LAST, IT SEEMS TO ME, WHO OFFERED HIM A SACRIFICE: FOR I HAVE FOUND NO ONE WHO UNDERSTOOD WHAT I WAS DOING THEN.44

MEANWHILE I HAVE LEARNED MUCH, ALL TOO MUCH, MORE ABOUT THE PHILOSOPHY OF THIS GOD, AND, AS I SAID, FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH‚ÄÎI, THE LAST DISCIPLE AND INITIATE OF THE GOD DIONYSUS‚ÄÎAND I SUPPOSE I MIGHT BEGIN AT LONG LAST TO OFFER YOU, MY FRIENDS, A FEW TASTES OF THIS PHILOSOPHY, INSOFAR AS THIS IS PERMITTED TO ME? IN AN UNDERTONE, AS IS FAIR, FOR IT CONCERNS MUCH THAT IS SECRET, NEW, STRANGE, ODD, UNCANNY.

EVEN THAT DIONYSUS IS A PHILOSOPHER, AND THAT GODS, TOO, THUS DO PHILOSOPHY, SEEMS TO ME TO BE A NOVELTY THAT IS FAR FROM INNOCUOUS AND MIGHT AROUSE SUSPICION PRECISELY AMONG PHILOSOPHERS. AMONG YOU, MY FRIENDS, IT WILL NOT SEEM SO OFFENSIVE, UNLESS IT COMES TOO LATE AND NOT AT THE RIGHT MOMENT; FOR TODAY, AS I HAVE BEEN TOLD, YOU NO LONGER LIKE TO BELIEVE IN GOD AND GODS. PERHAPS I SHALL ALSO HAVE TO CARRY FRANKNESS FURTHER IN MY TALE THAN WILL ALWAYS BE PLEASING TO THE STRICT HABITS OF YOUR EARS? CERTAINLY THE GOD IN QUESTION WENT FURTHER, VERY MUCH FURTHER, IN DIALOGUES OF THIS SORT AND WAS ALWAYS MANY STEPS AHEAD OF ME.

INDEED, IF IT WERE PERMITTED TO FOLLOW HUMAN CUSTOM IN ACCORDING TO HIM MANY SOLEMN POMP-AND-VIRTUE NAMES, I SHOULD HAVE TO GIVE ABUNDANT PRAISE TO HIS EXPLORER AND DISCOVERER COURAGE, HIS DARING HONESTY, TRUTHFULNESS, AND LOVE OF WISDOM. BUT SUCH A GOD HAS NO USE WHATEVER FOR ALL SUCH VENERABLE JUNK AND POMP. ‚ÄÚKEEP THAT,‚ÄÙ HE WOULD SAY, ‚ÄÚFOR YOURSELF AND YOUR LIKES AND WHOEVER ELSE HAS NEED OF IT! I‚ÄÎHAVE NO REASON FOR COVERING MY NAKEDNESS.‚ÄÙ

ONE GUESSES: THIS TYPE OF DEITY AND PHILOSOPHER IS PERHAPS LACKING IN SHAME?

THUS HE ONCE SAID: ‚ÄÚUNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES I LOVE WHAT IS HUMAN‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND WITH THIS HE ALLUDED TO ARIADNE WHO WAS PRESENT45‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚMAN IS TO MY MIND AN AGREEABLE, COURAGEOUS, INVENTIVE ANIMAL THAT HAS NO EQUAL ON EARTH; IT FINDS ITS WAY IN ANY LABYRINTH. I AM WELL DISPOSED TOWARDS HIM: I OFTEN REFLECT HOW I MIGHT YET ADVANCE HIM AND MAKE HIM STRONGER, MORE EVIL, AND MORE PROFOUND THAN HE IS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSTRONGER, MORE EVIL, AND MORE PROFOUND?‚ÄÙ I ASKED STARTLED. ‚ÄÚYES,‚ÄÙ HE SAID ONCE MORE; ‚ÄÚSTRONGER, MORE EVIL, AND MORE PROFOUND; ALSO MORE BEAUTIFUL‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND AT THAT THE TEMPTER GOD SMILED WITH HIS HALCYON SMILE AS THOUGH HE HAD JUST PAID AN ENCHANTING COMPLIMENT. HERE WE ALSO SEE: WHAT THIS DIVINITY LACKS IS NOT ONLY A SENSE OF SHAME‚ÄÎAND THERE ARE ALSO OTHER GOOD REASONS FOR CONJECTURING THAT IN SEVERAL RESPECTS ALL OF THE GODS COULD LEARN FROM US HUMANS. WE HUMANS ARE‚ÄÎMORE HUMANE.46‚ÄÎ

ALAS, WHAT ARE YOU AFTER ALL, MY WRITTEN AND PAINTED THOUGHTS! IT WAS NOT LONG AGO THAT YOU WERE STILL SO COLORFUL, YOUNG, AND MALICIOUS, FULL OF THORNS AND SECRET SPICES‚ÄÎYOU MADE ME SNEEZE AND LAUGH‚ÄÎAND NOW? YOU HAVE ALREADY TAKEN OFF YOUR NOVELTY, AND SOME OF YOU ARE READY, I FEAR, TO BECOME TRUTHS: THEY ALREADY LOOK SO IMMORTAL, SO PATHETICALLY DECENT, SO DULL! AND HAS IT EVER BEEN DIFFERENT? WHAT THINGS DO WE COPY, WRITING AND PAINTING, WE MANDARINS WITH CHINESE BRUSHES, WE IMMORTALIZERS OF THINGS THAT CAN BE WRITTEN‚ÄÎWHAT ARE THE ONLY THINGS WE ARE ABLE TO PAINT? ALAS, ALWAYS ONLY WHAT IS ON THE VERGE OF WITHERING AND LOSING ITS FRAGRANCE! ALAS; ALWAYS ONLY STORMS THAT ARE PASSING, EXHAUSTED, AND FEELINGS THAT ARE AUTUMNAL AND YELLOW! ALAS, ALWAYS ONLY BIRDS THAT GREW WEARY OF FLYING AND FLEW ASTRAY AND NOW CAN BE CAUGHT BY HAND‚ÄÎBY OUR HAND! WE IMMORTALIZE WHAT CANNOT LIVE AND FLY MUCH LONGER‚ÄÎONLY WEARY AND MELLOW THINGS! AND IT IS ONLY YOUR AFTERNOON, YOU, MY WRITTEN AND PAINTED THOUGHTS, FOR WHICH ALONE I HAVE COLORS, MANY COLORS PERHAPS, MANY MOTLEY CARESSES AND FIFTY YELLOWS AND BROWNS AND GREENS AND REDS: BUT NOBODY WILL GUESS FROM THAT HOW YOU LOOKED IN YOUR MORNING, YOU SUDDEN SPARKS AND WONDERS OF MY SOLITUDE, YOU MY OLD BELOVED‚ÄÎWICKED THOUGHTS!

3 CF. THE OUTLOOK OF THE HEROES OF THE ILIAD.

4 WHILE THE IDEAS DEVELOPED HERE, AND EXPLICATED AT GREATER LENGTH A YEAR LATER IN THE FIRST PART OF THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS, HAD BEEN EXPRESSED BY NIETZSCHE IN 1878 IN SECTION 45 OF HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN, THIS IS THE PASSAGE IN WHICH HIS FAMOUS TERMS ‚ÄÚMASTER MORALITY‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚSLAVE MORALITY‚ÄÙ ARE INTRODUCED.

5 THESE CRUCIAL QUALIFICATIONS, THOUGH ADDED IMMEDIATELY, HAVE OFTEN BEEN OVERLOOKED. ‚ÄÚMODERN‚ÄÙ MORALITIES ARE CLEARLY MIXTURES; HENCE THEIR MANIFOLD TENSIONS, HYPOCRISIES, AND CONTRADICTIONS.

6 THE FINAL CLAUSE THAT FOLLOWS THE DASH, OMITTED IN THE COWAN TRANSLATION, IS CRUCIAL AND QUALIFIES THE FIRST PART OF THE SENTENCE: A NOBLE PERSON HAS NO DUTIES TO ANIMALS BUT TREATS THEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS FEELINGS, WHICH MEANS, IF HE IS NOBLE, WITH PITY.

THE RULING MASTERS, OF COURSE, ARE NOT ALWAYS NOBLE IN THIS SENSE, AND THIS IS RECOGNIZED BY NIETZSCHE IN TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS, IN THE CHAPTER ‚ÄÚTHE ‚ÄÒIMPROVERS‚ÄÔ OF MANKIND,‚ÄÙ IN WHICH HE GIVES STRONG EXPRESSION TO HIS DISTASTE FOR MANU‚ÄÔS LAWS CONCERNING OUTCASTES (PORTABLE NIETZSCHE); ALSO IN THE WILL TO POWER (ED. W. KAUFMANN, NEW YORK, RANDOM HOUSE, 1967), SECTION 142. INDEED, IN THE ANTICHRIST, SECTION 57, NIETZSCHE CONTRADICTS OUTRIGHT HIS FORMULATION ABOVE: ‚ÄÚWHEN THE EXCEPTIONAL HUMAN BEING TREATS THE MEDIOCRE MORE TENDERLY THAN HIMSELF AND HIS PEERS, THIS IS NOT MERE COURTESY OF THE HEART‚ÄÎIT IS SIMPLY HIS DUTY.‚ÄÙ

MORE IMPORTANT: NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS OBVIOUS DISTASTE FOR SLAVE MORALITY AND THE FACT THAT HE MAKES A POINT OF LIKING MASTER MORALITY BETTER DOES NOT IMPLY THAT HE ENDORSES MASTER MORALITY. CF. THE TEXT FOR NOTE 5 ABOVE.

7 CLEARLY, MASTER MORALITY CANNOT BE DISCOVERED BY INTROSPECTION NOR BY THE OBSERVATION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ‚ÄÚMASTERS‚ÄÙ RATHER THAN ‚ÄÚSLAVES.‚ÄÙ BOTH OF THESE MISUNDERSTANDINGS ARE WIDESPREAD. WHAT IS CALLED FOR IS RATHER A REREADING OF, SAY, THE ILIAD AND, TO ILLUSTRATE ‚ÄÚSLAVE MORALITY,‚ÄÙ THE NEW TESTAMENT.

8 LITERALLY ‚ÄÚA GOOD HUMAN BEING,‚ÄÙ THE TERM IS USED FOR PRECISELY THE TYPE DESCRIBED HERE.

9 ‚ÄÚGAY SCIENCE‚ÄÙ: IN THE EARLY FOURTEENTH CENTURY THE TERM WAS USED TO DESIGNATE THE ART OF THE TROUBADOURS, CODIFIED IN LEYS D‚ÄÔAMORS. NIETZSCHE SUBTITLED HIS OWN FR√∂HLICHE WISSENSCHAFT (1882), ‚ÄÚLA GAYA SCIENZA,‚ÄÙ PLACED A QUATRAIN ON THE TITLE PAGE, BEGAN THE BOOK WITH A FIFTEEN-PAGE ‚ÄÚPRELUDE IN GERMAN RHYMES,‚ÄÙ AND IN THE SECOND EDITION (1887) ADDED, BESIDES A PREFACE AND BOOK V, AN ‚ÄÚAPPENDIX‚ÄÙ OF FURTHER VERSES.

HIS LAMARCKISM IS NOT JUST AN ODD FACT ABOUT NIETZSCHE BUT SYMPTOMATIC OF HIS CONCEPTION OF BODY AND SPIRIT: HE RIDICULED BELIEF IN ‚ÄÚPURE‚ÄÙ SPIRIT BUT BELIEVED JUST AS LITTLE IN ANY ‚ÄÚPURE‚ÄÙ BODY; HE CLAIMED THAT NEITHER COULD BE UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT THE OTHER.

26 THE PARENTHESIS IS NOT FOUND IN THE FIRST TWO EDITIONS OF 1886 AND 1891, BUT IT APPEARS IN ALL STANDARD EDITIONS, INCLUDING SCHLECHTA‚ÄÔS, ALTHOUGH HE PURPORTS TO FOLLOW THE ORIGINAL EDITION. WHEN NIETZSCHE INCLUDED THIS PASSAGE IN NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER IN SLIGHTLY REVISED FORM, THE REMARK WAS SET OFF BY DASHES INSTEAD OF PARENTHESES AND READ, ‚ÄÚI DO NOT MENTION FAR GREATER NAMES, BUT I MEAN THEM‚ÄÙ (PORTABLE NIETZSCHE). THE THIRD EDITION OF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL (1894) HAS ‚ÄÚFAR GREATER NAMES.‚ÄÙ

ACCORDING TO THE TABLE COMPARING THE PAGE NUMBERS OF THE DIFFERENT EDITIONS OF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL IN VOL. VII (1903) OF THE GROSSOKTAV EDITION OF THE WERKE, THE THIRD EDITION OF BEYOND WAS DATED 1893, THE FOURTH 1894, AND THE PAGE NUMBERS OF BOTH ARE THE SAME; BUT THE PRINCETON UNIVERSITY LIBRARY HAS A COPY OF THE DRITTE AUFLAGE (THIRD EDITION) DATED 1894.

28 THE PARENTHESIS IS NOT FOUND IN THE FIRST FOUR EDITIONS (SEE NOTE 26 ABOVE), BUT IN MOST SUBSEQUENT EDITIONS, INCLUDING SCHLECHTA‚ÄÔS. IN NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER WE READ, INSTEAD OF THE PARENTHESIS: ‚ÄÚ‚ÄÎTHE CASE OF HAMLET.‚ÄÙ

29 AN ALLUSION TO AN OFT-QUOTED SENTENCE FROM LESSING‚ÄÔS EMILIA GALOTTI, ACT I, SCENE 4: ‚ÄÚOR DO YOU THINK, MY PRINCE, THAT RAPHAEL WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST ARTISTIC [LITERALLY: PAINTERLY] GENIUS IF HE HAD BEEN BORN BY SOME MISFORTUNE WITHOUT HANDS?‚ÄÙ

THIS SECTION REMINDS US FORCEFULLY THAT NIETZSCHE IS NOT PROPOSING ANY EASY BIFURCATION OF MANKIND: NOT ONLY ARE APPEARANCES MISLEADING, AS HE POINTS OUT AGAIN AND AGAIN, BUT HE CONSIDERS THE BELIEF IN OPPOSITE VALUES AN INVETERATE PREJUDICE (SEE, E.G., SECTION 2) AND INSISTS ON A SCALE OF SUBTLE SHADES, DEGREES, AND NUANCES.

30 THIS SECTION MAY SIGNAL THE APPROACHING END OF THE BOOK. AND THE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING SECTIONS, BEING LESS CONTINUOUS THAN THE PRECEDING, MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN PLACED HERE FROM A SENSE OF ‚ÄÚWHERE ELSE?‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHE END BEING AT HAND. IN A SENSE, TO BE SURE, THEY BELONG IN PART IX, ‚ÄÚWHAT IS NOBLE,‚ÄÙ FOR THEY DEAL WITH THE FEELINGS OF THE UNCOMMON MAN WHO LIVES APART; BUT THEY SEEM MORE PERSONAL.

31 SEE SECTIONS 30, 40, 289, AND 290.

32 BUT SEE SECTION 227: ‚ÄÚHONESTY, SUPPOSING THAT THIS IS OUR VIRTUE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ AND DAWN, SECTION 556 (QUOTED IN FULL): ‚ÄÚTHE GOOD FOUR.‚ÄÎHONEST WITH OURSELVES AND WHOEVER ELSE IS OUR FRIEND; COURAGEOUS WITH THE ENEMY; MAGNANIMOUS WITH THE VANQUISHED; COURTEOUS‚ÄÎALWAYS: THUS THE FOUR CARDINAL VIRTUES WANT US.‚ÄÙ PLATO‚ÄÔS FOUR CARDINAL VIRTUES HAD BEEN WISDOM, COURAGE, TEMPERANCE, AND JUSTICE (REPUBLIC 427FF.). IN GERMAN, THE FOUR TERMS IN THE DAWN ARE: REDLICH, TAPFER, GROSSM√ºTIG, H√∂FLICH; THE FOUR ABOVE: MUT, EINSICHT, MITGEF√ºHL, EINSAMKEIT. MUT AND TAPFERKEIT ARE SYNONYMS AND MEAN COURAGE. HONESTY AND INSIGHT ARE CLEARLY RELATED BUT NOT SYNONYMOUS, AND THIS IS ALSO TRUE OF MAGNANIMITY AND SYMPATHY. (THE LITERAL MEANING OF SYMPATHY AND MITGEF√ºHL IS THE SAME AND NEITHER IS RESTRICTED TO SUFFERING; BOTH MEAN FEELING WITH OTHERS WHAT THEY FEEL.) THE INCLUSION OF SYMPATHY AMONG THE FOUR VIRTUES IS NOTEWORTHY, PARTICULARLY AS IT OCCURS IN ‚ÄÚWHAT IS NOBLE‚ÄÙ IN BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL.

33 CF. ZARATHUSTRA, PART II: ‚ÄÚTHE GREATEST EVENTS‚ÄÎTHEY ARE NOT OUR LOUDEST BUT OUR STILLEST HOURS. NOT AROUND THE INVENTORS OF NEW NOISE, BUT AROUND THE INVENTORS OF NEW VALUES DOES THE WORLD REVOLVE; IT REVOLVES INAUDIBLY‚ÄÙ (‚ÄÚON GREAT EVENTS,‚ÄÙ); AND ‚ÄÚTHOUGHTS THAT COME ON DOVES‚ÄÔ FEET GUIDE THE WORLD‚ÄÙ (‚ÄÚTHE STILLEST HOUR,‚ÄÙ). THE IMPLICATIONS FOR NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS ALLEGED BIFURCATION OF HUMANITY SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED: WE ARE IN NO POSITION TO TELL WHO AMONG OUR CONTEMPORARIES IS GREAT.

34 GOETHE‚ÄÔS FAUST, LINES 11989F. THIS APHORISM MAKES LITTLE SENSE UNLESS ONE RECOGNIZES THE QUOTATION AND KNOWS THAT DOCTOR MARIANUS THUS LEADS UP TO HIS APOSTROPHE TO THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN.‚ÄÎONE MAY WONDER WHETHER IT COULD POSSIBLY BE NOBLE TO INSIST SO OFTEN THAT ONE IS LOOKING DOWN; BUT AT LEAST NIETZSCHE DOES NOT PURPORT TO SPEAK OF HIMSELF.

41 TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH FROM NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS GERMAN. THOUGH THE WORDS APPEAR IN QUOTATION MARKS, THERE SEEM TO BE ONLY FIVE PASSAGES IN WHICH HOBBES DISCUSSES LAUGHTER‚ÄÎNEVER IN QUITE THESE WORDS. (TWO OF THESE ARE FOUND IN THE LATIN WORKS AND ADD NOTHING TO THE QUOTATIONS THAT FOLLOW.) HOBBES EXPLAINED LAUGHTER BY INVOKING THE WILL TO POWER, ALBEIT WITHOUT USING THAT TERM.

THE FIRST AND LONGEST DISCUSSION IS FOUND IN HUMAN NATURE (1640), CHAPTER IX. 13: ‚ÄÚTHERE IS A PASSION THAT HATH NO NAME; BUT THE SIGN OF IT IS THAT DISTORTION OF THE COUNTENANCE WHICH WE CALL LAUGHTER, WHICH IS ALWAYS JOY‚Ä¶. WHATSOEVER IT BE THAT MOVETH TO LAUGHTER, IT MUST BE NEW AND UNEXPECTED. MEN LAUGH OFTEN, ESPECIALLY SUCH AS ARE GREEDY OF APPLAUSE FROM EVERY THING THEY DO WELL, AT THEIR OWN ACTIONS PERFORMED NEVER SO LITTLE BEYOND THEIR OWN EXPECTATIONS; AS ALSO AT THEIR OWN JESTS: AND IN THIS CASE IT IS MANIFEST, THAT THE PASSION OF LAUGHTER PROCEEDETH FROM A SUDDEN CONCEPTION OF SOME ABILITY IN HIMSELF THAT LAUGHETH. ALSO MEN LAUGH AT THE INFIRMITIES OF OTHERS, BY COMPARISON WHEREWITH THEIR OWN ABILITIES ARE SET OFF AND ILLUSTRATED. ALSO MEN LAUGH AT JESTS, THE WIT WHEREOF ALWAYS CONSISTETH IN THE ELEGANT DISCOVERING AND CONVEYING TO OUR MINDS SOME ABSURDITY OF ANOTHER: AND IN THIS CASE ALSO THE PASSION OF LAUGHTER PROCEEDETH FROM THE SUDDEN IMAGINATION OF OUR OWN ODDS AND EMINENCY‚Ä¶. FOR WHEN A JEST IS BROKEN UPON OURSELVES, OR FRIENDS OF WHOSE DISHONOUR WE PARTICIPATE, WE NEVER LAUGH THEREAT. I MAY THEREFORE CONCLUDE, THAT THE PASSION OF LAUGHTER IS NOTHING ELSE BUT SUDDEN GLORY ARISING FROM SOME SUDDEN CONCEPTION OF SOME EMINENCY IN OURSELVES, BY COMPARISON WITH THE INFIRMITY OF OTHERS, OR WITH OUR OWN FORMERLY: FOR MEN LAUGH AT THE FOLLIES OF THEMSELVES PAST‚Ä¶BESIDES, IT IS VAIN GLORY, AND AN ARGUMENT OF LITTLE WORTH, TO THINK THE INFIRMITY OF ANOTHER, SUFFICIENT MATTER FOR HIS TRIUMPH.‚ÄÙ

THE PARALLEL PASSAGE IN THE LEVIATHAN (1651), PART I, CHAPTER 6, WHICH IS MUCH SHORTER, ENDS: ‚ÄÚAND IT IS INCIDENT MOST TO THEM, THAT ARE CONSCIOUS OF THE FEWEST ABILITIES IN THEMSELVES; WHO ARE FORCED TO KEEP THEMSELVES IN THEIR OWN FAVOUR, BY OBSERVING THE IMPERFECTIONS OF OTHER MEN. AND THEREFORE MUCH LAUGHTER AT THE DEFECTS OF OTHERS IS A SIGNE OF PUSILLANIMITY. FOR OF GREAT MINDS, ONE OF THE PROPER WORKES IS, TO HELP AND FREE OTHERS FROM SCORN; AND COMPARE THEMSELVES ONELY WITH THE MOST ABLE.‚ÄÙ

FINALLY, IN ‚ÄÚTHE ANSWER OF MR. HOBBES TO SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT‚ÄÔS PREFACE BEFORE GONDIBERT‚ÄÙ (PARIS, JAN. 10, 1650; REPRINTED IN THE ENGLISH WORKS OF THOMAS HOBBES, VOL. IV, 1840) HOBBES SAYS (PP. 454F.): ‚ÄÚGREAT PERSONS, THAT HAVE THEIR MINDS EMPLOYED ON GREAT DESIGNS, HAVE NOT LEISURE ENOUGH TO LAUGH, AND ARE PLEASED WITH THE CONTEMPLATION OF THEIR OWN POWER AND VIRTUES, SO AS THEY NEED NOT THE INFIRMITIES AND VICES OF OTHER MEN TO RECOMMEND THEMSELVES TO THEIR OWN FAVOUR BY COMPARISON, AS ALL MEN DO WHEN THEY LAUGH.‚ÄÙ

HOBBES IS EVIDENTLY THINKING QUITE LITERALLY OF LAUGHTER WHILE FOR NIETZSCHE LAUGHTER REPRESENTS AN ATTITUDE TOWARD THE WORLD, TOWARD LIFE, AND TOWARD ONESELF. IN THE GAY SCIENCE (1882) HE HAD WRITTEN: ‚ÄÚLAUGHTER MEANS: TO REJOICE AT ANOTHER‚ÄÔS EXPENSE [SCHADENFROH SEIN], BUT WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE‚ÄÙ (SECTION 200). AND STILL EARLIER, IN HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN (1878): ‚ÄÚDESCENDING BELOW THE ANIMALS.‚ÄÎWHEN MAN NEIGHS WITH LAUGHTER, HE SURPASSES ALL ANIMALS BY HIS VULGARITY‚ÄÙ (SECTION 553). BUT IN THE SECOND VOLUME OF THE SAME WORK (1879) WE FIND AN APHORISM (SECTION 173): ‚ÄÚLAUGHING AND SMILING.‚ÄÎTHE MORE JOYOUS AND CERTAIN HIS SPIRIT BECOMES, THE MORE MAN UNLEARNS LOUD LAUGHTER; INSTEAD A MORE SPIRITUAL SMILE CONSTANTLY WELLS UP IN HIM‚Ä¶.‚ÄÙ AND IN A NOTE OF THAT PERIOD (MUSARION EDITION, IX, 413): ‚ÄÚEVERYTHING SUDDEN PLEASES IF IT DOES NO HARM; HENCE WIT‚Ä¶. FOR A TENSION IS THUS RELEASED‚Ä¶.‚ÄÙ AND ANOTHER NOTE (SAME PAGE): ‚ÄÚCARICATURE IS THE BEGINNING OF ART. THAT SOMETHING SIGNIFIES, DELIGHTS. THAT WHATEVER SIGNIFIES, SHOULD MOCK AND BE LAUGHED AT, DELIGHTS STILL MORE. LAUGHING AT SOMETHING IS THE FIRST SIGN OF A HIGHER PSYCHIC LIFE (AS IN THE FINE ARTS).‚ÄÙ

IN SPITE OF THE TITLE THE GAY SCIENCE, NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CELEBRATION OF LAUGHTER IS ENCOUNTERED FIRST AND FOREMOST IN ZARATHUSTRA. TO CITE ALL THE RELEVANT PASSAGES (PORTABLE NIETZSCHE) WOULD BE POINTLESS, BUT THE THREE MOST SIGNIFICANT SHOULD BE MENTIONED.

‚ÄÚNOT BY WRATH DOES ONE KILL BUT BY LAUGHTER. COME, LET US KILL THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY!‚ÄÙ (‚ÄÚON READING AND WRITING,‚ÄÙ).

‚ÄÚAS YET HE HAS NOT LEARNED LAUGHTER OR BEAUTY. GLOOMY THIS HUNTER RETURNED FROM THE WOODS OF KNOWLEDGE‚Ä¶. BUT I DO NOT LIKE THESE TENSE SOULS‚Ä¶. AS YET HIS KNOWLEDGE HAS NOT LEARNED TO SMILE‚Ä¶. GRACEFULNESS IS PART OF THE GRACIOUSNESS OF THE GREAT-SOULED‚Ä¶. VERILY, I HAVE OFTEN LAUGHED AT THE WEAKLINGS WHO THOUGHT THEMSELVES GOOD BECAUSE THEY HAD NO CLAWS‚ÄÙ (‚ÄÚON THOSE WHO ARE SUBLIME,‚ÄÙ, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHAPTERS IN NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS WRITINGS).

‚ÄÚWHAT HAS SO FAR BEEN THE GREATEST SIN HERE ON EARTH? WAS IT NOT THE WORD OF HIM WHO SAID, ‚ÄÒWOE UNTO THOSE WHO LAUGH HERE‚ÄÔ?‚Ä¶HE DID NOT LOVE ENOUGH: ELSE HE WOULD ALSO HAVE LOVED US WHO LAUGH. BUT HE HATED AND MOCKED US: HOWLING AND GNASHING OF TEETH HE PROMISED US‚Ä¶. LAUGHTER I HAVE PRONOUNCED HOLY; YOU HIGHER MEN, LEARN TO LAUGH!‚ÄÙ (‚ÄÚON THE HIGHER MAN,‚ÄÙ SECTIONS 16 AND 20).

FOR NIETZSCHE LAUGHTER BECOMES LESS A PHYSICAL PHENOMENON THAN A SYMBOL OF JOYOUS AFFIRMATION OF LIFE AND OF THE REFUSAL TO BOW BEFORE THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY.

42 CF. SECTION 42, NOTE: VERSUCHER-GOTT COULD ALSO MEAN ‚ÄÚGOD OF EXPERIMENTERS.‚ÄÙ

43 SOME OF THE FEATURES OF THIS PORTRAIT BRING TO MIND SOCRATES. IN THIS CONNECTION SECTION 212 MIGHT BE REREAD; ALSO THE BEGINNING OF SECTION 340 OF THE GAY SCIENCE: ‚ÄÚTHE DYING SOCRATES.‚ÄÎI ADMIRE THE COURAGE AND WISDOM OF SOCRATES IN EVERYTHING HE DID, SAID‚ÄÎAND DID NOT SAY. THIS MOCKING AND ENAMORED MONSTER AND PIED PIPER OF ATHENS, WHO MADE THE MOST ARROGANT YOUTHS TREMBLE AND SOB, WAS NOT ONLY THE WISEST TALKER WHO EVER LIVED: HE WAS JUST AS GREAT IN HIS SILENCE‚Ä¶.‚ÄÙ

THE IMAGE OF THE PIED PIPER RECURS IN THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PRESENT SECTION‚ÄÎAND THE PREFACE TO TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS WHERE NIETZSCHE CALLS HIMSELF ‚ÄÚAN OLD PSYCHOLOGIST AND PIED PIPER‚ÄÙ (PORTABLE NIETZSCHE). WITH THE PRAISE OF SOCRATES‚ÄÔ GREATNESS ‚ÄÚIN HIS SILENCE‚ÄÙ COMPARE NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS COMMENT ON BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL IN ECCE HOMO, WHERE HE PRAISES THE BOOK FOR ‚ÄÚTHE SUBTLETY OF ITS FORM, OF ITS INTENT, OF ITS ART OF SILENCE,‚ÄÙ ALL OF WHICH HE CONTRASTS WITH ZARATHUSTRA.

FINALLY, THE SECTION ON THE GENIUS OF THE HEART SHOULD BE COMPARED WITH THE WORDS OF THE PLATONIC SOCRATES, ON THE LAST PAGE OF THE THEAETETUS: ‚ÄÚSUPPOSING YOU SHOULD EVER HENCEFORTH TRY TO CONCEIVE AFRESH, THEAETETUS, IF YOU SUCCEED YOUR EMBRYO THOUGHTS WILL BE THE BETTER AS A CONSEQUENCE OF TODAY‚ÄÔS SCRUTINY; AND IF YOU REMAIN BARREN, YOU WILL BE GENTLER‚Ä¶HAVING THE GOOD SENSE NOT TO FANCY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO NOT KNOW. FOR THAT, AND NO MORE, IS ALL THAT MY ART CAN EFFECT; NOR HAVE I ANY OF THAT KNOWLEDGE POSSESSED BY ALL THE GREAT AND ADMIRABLE MEN OF OUR OWN DAY OR OF THE PAST. BUT THIS MIDWIFE‚ÄÔS ART IS A GIFT FROM HEAVEN; MY MOTHER HAD IT FOR WOMEN, AND I FOR YOUNG MEN OF A GENEROUS SPIRIT AND FOR ALL IN WHOM BEAUTY DWELLS‚ÄÙ (F. M. CORNFORD TRANSLATION).

44 ALTHOUGH ‚ÄÚFIRST-BORN‚ÄÙ IS PLURAL IN THE ORIGINAL (ERSTLINGE), THE PRIMARY REFERENCE IS CERTAINLY TO THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY. FROM THE PREFACE ADDED TO THE NEW EDITION OF 1886 (THE SAME YEAR THAT SAW THE PUBLICATION OF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL) IT IS PLAIN THAT BY NOW NIETZSCHE FELT THAT HE HIMSELF HAD NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD IN 1872 WHAT HE WAS DOING.

MORE IMPORTANT: THE DIONYSUS OF HIS LATER WORKS IS NO LONGER THE DIONYSUS OF THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY. IN THE EARLY WORK, DIONYSUS STANDS FOR UNCONTROLLED, FRENZIED, INTOXICATED PASSION AND IS CONTRASTED WITH APOLLO; IN THE LATER WORKS, DIONYSUS STANDS FOR CONTROLLED AND CREATIVELY EMPLOYED PASSION‚ÄÎTHE MATURE GOETHE IS NOW CALLED DIONYSIAN (TWILIGHT, SECTION 49, PORTABLE NIETZSCHE.)‚ÄÎAND IS CONTRASTED WITH ‚ÄÚTHE CRUCIFIED‚ÄÙ (END OF ECCE HOMO) AND THE EXTIRPATION OF THE PASSIONS AND THE DENIAL OF THIS WORLD.

45 THERE IS A LARGE LITERATURE, MUCH OF IT INORDINATELY PRETENTIOUS AND SILLY, ABOUT NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CONCEPTION OF ARIADNE. FOR A VERY BRIEF EXPLANATION, SEE KAUFMANN‚ÄÔS NIETZSCHE, CHAPTER 1, SECTION II.

TRANSLATOR‚ÄÔS NOTE

‚ÄÚAUS HOHEN BERGEN. NACHGESANG.‚ÄÙ IN THE ORIGINAL EDITION THIS TITLE OCCUPIES A RIGHT-HAND PAGE BY ITSELF, FACING SECTION 296, AND THE POEM BEGINS ON THE NEXT RIGHT-HAND PAGE. THE ASTERISKS AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE POEM ARE FOUND IN THE ORIGINAL EDITION.

MY TRANSLATION, THOUGH RELATIVELY FAITHFUL, IS NOT ENTIRELY LITERAL; AND THIS IS ONE REASON FOR FURNISHING THE ORIGINAL TEXT, TOO‚ÄÎIN FAIRNESS TO BOTH AUTHOR AND READER. THERE IS ANOTHER REASON: FAIRNESS TO THE TRANSLATOR; FOR THE POEM IS NOT ONE OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS BEST. (THE FIVE DOTS OCCURRING FOUR TIMES IN THE GERMAN TEXT DO NOT MARK AN OMISSION BUT ARE AMONG NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CHARACTERISTIC PUNCTUATION DEVICES: SOMETIMES THEY ARE USED TO INDICATE THAT A THOUGHT BREAKS OFF OR THAT SOMETHING REMAINS UNSAID; HERE THEY PLAINLY SUGGEST A LONG PAUSE.)

MORE OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS VERSE, ALSO WITH THE ORIGINAL AND TRANSLATION ON FACING PAGES, IS INCLUDED IN TWENTY GERMAN POETS: A BILINGUAL COLLECTION.1 ONE OF THOSE POEMS, ‚ÄÚTO THE MISTRAL: A DANCING SONG,‚ÄÙ HAS A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR RHYME SCHEME BUT STRIKES ME AS A MUCH BETTER POEM THAN ‚ÄÚFROM HIGH MOUNTAINS.‚ÄÙ

I CONFESS THAT I DO NOT ADMIRE THE PRESENT POEM‚ÄÎEXCEPT FOR ONE MAGNIFICENT LINE WHICH DEFIES TRANSLATION:

NUR WER SICH WANDELT, BLEIBT MIT MIR VERWANDT.

MY VERSION DOES NOT CAPTURE THE PLAY ON WORDS BUT TRIES TO COMMUNICATE THE MEANING: ‚ÄÚONE HAS TO CHANGE TO STAY AKIN TO ME.‚ÄÙ OR: ‚ÄÚONLY THOSE WHO CHANGE REMAIN RELATED TO ME.‚ÄÙ THIS RENDERING IS FAR FROM PERFECT BUT IT AT LEAST RECTIFIES THE MISREADING OF THE LINE IN L. A. MAGNUS‚ÄÔ TRANSLATION OF THE POEM APPENDED TO HELEN ZIMMERN‚ÄÔS VERSION OF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL: ‚ÄÚNONE BUT NEW KITH ARE NATIVE OF MY LAND!‚ÄÙ

NIETZSCHE HAD SENT AN EARLIER VERSION2 OF THIS POEM TO HEINRICH VON STEIN, WITH THE COMMENT: ‚ÄÚTHIS IS FOR YOU, MY DEAR FRIEND, TO REMEMBER SILS MARIA AND IN GRATITUDE FOR YOUR LETTER, SUCH A LETTER.‚ÄÙ3 IN HIS REPLY THE ‚ÄÚDEAR FRIEND‚ÄÙ GAVE EXPRESSION TO HIS WAGNER WORSHIP AND ASKED NIETZSCHE TO PARTICIPATE BY LETTER IN HIS WEEKLY DISCUSSIONS WITH TWO FRIENDS ABOUT ARTICLES IN THE WAGNER-LEXICON.4 THE POEM SEEMS SENTIMENTAL TO ME, BUT NIETZSCHE DID KNOW LONELINESS AS FEW MEN HAVE EVER KNOWN IT.

EDITOR‚ÄÔS INTRODUCTION





1


OF ALL OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS BOOKS, THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS COMES CLOSEST, AT LEAST IN FORM, TO ANGLO-AMERICAN PHILOSOPHY: IT CONSISTS OF THREE INQUIRIES, EACH SELF-CONTAINED AND YET RELATED TO THE OTHER TWO. EVEN THOSE WHO SUPPOSE, ERRONEOUSLY, THAT BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL IS A BOOK FOR BROWSING, A COLLECTION OF APHORISMS THAT MAY BE READ IN ANY ORDER WHATEVER, GENERALLY RECOGNIZE THAT THE GENEALOGY COMPRISES THREE ESSAYS. MOREOVER, ALL THREE ESSAYS DEAL WITH MORALITY, A SUBJECT CLOSE TO THE HEART OF BRITISH AND AMERICAN PHILOSOPHY; AND NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS MANNER IS MUCH MORE SOBER AND SINGLE-MINDED THAN USUAL.

YET IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE TITLE PAGE IS FOLLOWED BY THESE WORDS: ‚ÄÚA SEQUEL TO MY LAST BOOK, BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, WHICH IT IS MEANT TO SUPPLEMENT AND CLARIFY.‚ÄÙ1 IN OTHER WORDS, NIETZSCHE DID NOT SUPPOSE THAT THE GENEALOGY COULD BE READILY UNDERSTOOD BY ITSELF, AND IN THE FINAL SECTION OF THE PREFACE HE EXPLAINED EMPHATICALLY AT SOME LENGTH THAT HE PRESUPPOSED NOT ONLY A PASSING ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIS EARLIER BOOKS BUT ACTUALLY A RATHER CLOSE STUDY OF THEM.

MOREOVER, NIETZSCHE REFERS THE READER, ESPECIALLY (BUT NOT ONLY) IN THE PREFACE, TO A LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIFIC PASSAGES IN HIS EARLIER WORKS. IT IS EASY TO RESENT ALL THIS AS TEDIOUS AND SELF-IMPORTANT‚ÄÎAND TO MISUNDERSTAND THE BOOK AND NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS PHILOSOPHY GENERALLY. IT IS FASHIONABLE TO READ HASTILY, AS IF, FOR EXAMPLE, ONE KNEW ALL ABOUT NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CONTRAST OF MASTER AND SLAVE MORALITY BEFORE ONE HAD EVEN BEGUN TO READ HIM. BUT IF ONE READS SNIPPETS HERE AND THERE, PROJECTING ILL-FOUNDED PRECONCEPTIONS INTO THE GAPS, ONE IS APT TO MISCONSTRUE NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS MORAL PHILOSOPHY COMPLETELY‚ÄÎAS LOEB AND LEOPOLD DID WHEN, AS YOUNGSTERS, THEY SUPPOSED THAT A BRUTAL AND SENSELESS MURDER WOULD PROVE THEM MASTERS. SIMILAR MISUNDERSTANDINGS MAR MANY ACADEMIC INTERPRETATIONS; BUT PROFESSORS NATURALLY REACT DIFFERENTLY: THEY FEEL OUTRAGED BY NIETZSCHE AND DO VIOLENCE, ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL, TO HIM.

TO UNDERSTAND NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CONCEPTIONS OF MASTER AND SLAVE MORALITY, ONE SHOULD READ BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, SECTION 260, AND HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN, SECTION 45‚ÄÎAND KEEP IN MIND THE TITLE OF OUR BOOK, WHICH DEALS WITH THE ORIGINS OF MORALITY. NIETZSCHE DISTINGUISHES MORALITIES THAT ORIGINATED IN RULING CLASSES FROM MORALITIES THAT ORIGINATED AMONG THE OPPRESSED.

UNFORTUNATELY, SOME OF THE APHORISTIC MATERIAL IN HIS EARLIER WORKS TO WHICH NIETZSCHE REFERS US IS NOT EASY TO COME BY, AND THE LARGER PART OF IT HAS NEVER BEEN TRANSLATED ADEQUATELY. MOST OF THESE APHORISMS HAVE THEREFORE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE PRESENT VOLUME, IN NEW TRANSLATIONS. AND SOME COMMENTARY, IN THE FORM OF FOOTNOTES, MAY NOT BE SUPEREROGATORY.

THE EXTENT OF SUCH A COMMENTARY POSES INSOLUBLE PROBLEMS: IF THERE IS TOO LITTLE OF IT, STUDENTS MAY FEEL THAT THEY GET NO HELP WHERE THEY NEED IT; IF THERE IS TOO MUCH, IT BECOMES AN AFFRONT TO THE READER‚ÄÔS KNOWLEDGE AND INTELLIGENCE AND A MONUMENT OF PEDANTRY. NO MEAN CAN POSSIBLY BE RIGHT FOR ALL.

AT THE END OF HIS PREFACE NIETZSCHE SAYS THAT IT WON‚ÄÔT DO SIMPLY TO READ AN APHORISM, ONE MUST ALSO DECIPHER IT; AND HE CLAIMS THAT HIS WHOLE THIRD INQUIRY IS A PARADIGM CASE OF A COMMENTARY ON A SINGLE APHORISM. TAKING MY CUE FROM THIS SUGGESTION, I HAVE SELECTED ONE EXCEPTIONALLY INTERESTING SECTION IN THE THIRD ESSAY AND GIVEN IT A MUCH MORE, DETAILED COMMENTARY THAN THE REST OF THE BOOK: SECTION 24, WHICH DEALS WITH THE INTELLECTUAL CONSCIENCE AND WITH TRUTH. BUT THIS IS NOT TO SUGGEST THAT THIS SECTION IS SELF-CONTAINED; ON THE CONTRARY, THE ARGUMENT IS CONTINUED IN THE FOLLOWING SECTION‚ÄÎAND SO IS THE COMMENTARY.

THE TITLE OF OUR BOOK IS AMBIGUOUS, BUT IT IS CLEAR WHICH MEANING NIETZSCHE INTENDED. ZUR GENEALOGIE DER MORAL COULD MEAN ‚ÄÚTOWARD A (LITERALLY, ‚ÄÚTOWARD THE‚ÄÙ) GENEALOGY OF MORALS‚ÄÙ (OR MORALITY); IT COULD ALSO MEAN‚ÄÎAND DOES MEAN‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚON THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS.‚ÄÙ HOW CAN ONE TELL?

THERE IS ONE, AND ONLY ONE, SURE WAY. IN MANY OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS BOOKS, THE APHORISMS OR SECTIONS HAVE BRIEF TITLES; AND SEVERAL OF THESE (ABOUT TWO DOZEN) BEGIN WITH THE WORD ZUR, SO DO A GREAT MANY OF HIS NOTES, INCLUDING MORE THAN TWO DOZEN OF THOSE INCLUDED IN THE POSTHUMOUS COLLECTION, THE WILL TO POWER. IN THE CASE OF THE NOTES, TO BE SURE, THE TITLES WERE SOMETIMES ADDED BY PETER GAST, NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS WORSHIPFUL FRIEND AND EDITOR; BUT EVEN TITLES CONTRIBUTED BY GAST HAVE SOME EVIDENTIAL VALUE, AS HE HAD PRESUMABLY ACQUIRED SOME FEELING FOR NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS USAGE.

THE UPSHOT: IN NO TITLE DOES NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS ZUR OR ZUM CLEARLY MEAN ‚ÄÚTOWARD,‚ÄÙ AND HE USED ZUR AGAIN AND AGAIN IN CONTEXTS IN WHICH ‚ÄÚTOWARD‚ÄÙ MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL, AND ‚ÄÚON‚ÄÙ IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE MEANING; FOR EXAMPLE, THE HEADING OF SECTION 381, IN THE FIFTH BOOK OF THE GAY SCIENCE‚ÄÎPUBLISHED IN 1887 AS WAS THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS‚ÄÎREADS: ZUR FRAGE DER VERST√§NDLICHKEIT, ‚ÄÚON THE QUESTION OF BEING UNDERSTANDABLE.‚ÄÙ TO BE SURE, IF THAT SAME PHRASE WERE FOUND IN HEIDEGGER, ONE WOULD NOT HESITATE TO TRANSLATE IT, ‚ÄÚTOWARD THE QUESTION OF UNDERSTANDABILITY‚ÄÙ: HEIDEGGER IS ALWAYS ON THE WAY TOWARD THE POINT FROM WHICH IT MAY BE POSSIBLE SOME DAY TO ASK A QUESTION. BUT NOT NIETZSCHE. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO KNOW THE LANGUAGE; ONE MUST ALSO ACQUIRE SOME FEELING FOR AN AUTHOR. TOWARD THE LATTER END, AN EXCELLENT PRESCRIPTION WOULD BE TO READ NIETZSCHE ‚ÄÚON THE QUESTION OF BEING UNDERSTANDABLE;‚ÄÙ AND THIS APHORISM IS INCLUDED IN THE PRESENT VOLUME.

SPEAKING OF INTELLIGIBILITY: WHY DOES NIETZSCHE USE THE FRENCH WORD RESSENTIMENT? FIRST OF ALL, THE GERMAN LANGUAGE LACKS ANY CLOSE EQUIVALENT TO THE FRENCH TERM. THAT ALONE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT EXCUSE FOR NIETZSCHE, THOUGH PERHAPS NOT FOR A TRANSLATOR, WHO COULD USE ‚ÄÚRESENTMENT.‚ÄÙ

SECONDLY, NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS EMERGENCE FROM THE INFLUENCE OF WAGNER, WHO EXTOLLED EVERYTHING GERMANIC AND EXCORIATED THE FRENCH, WAS MARKED BY AN ATTITUDE MORE FRANCOPHILE THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER MAJOR GERMAN WRITER‚ÄÎAT LEAST SINCE LEIBNIZ (1646‚ÄÌ1716), WHO PREFERRED TO WRITE IN FRENCH. NIETZSCHE SAW HIMSELF AS THE HEIR OF THE FRENCH MORALISTES AND AS A ‚ÄÚGOOD EUROPEAN.‚ÄÙ

IN 1805 HEGEL WROTE TO JOHANN HEINRICH VOSS, WHO HAD TRANSLATED HOMER INTO GERMAN DACTYLIC HEXAMETERS: ‚ÄÚI SHOULD LIKE TO SAY OF MY ASPIRATIONS THAT I SHALL TRY TO TEACH PHILOSOPHY TO SPEAK GERMAN.‚ÄÙ2 AVOIDING GREEK, LATIN, AND FRENCH TERMS, HEGEL CREATED AN INVOLVED GERMAN TERMINOLOGY, DEVISING ELABORATE LOCUTIONS THAT MAKE HIS PROSE UTTERLY FORBIDDING. AND A LITTLE OVER A CENTURY LATER, HEIDEGGER TRIED TO DO MUCH THE SAME THING. YET HEGEL WAS ASSUREDLY WRONG WHEN HE WENT ON TO SAY, IN THE NEXT SENTENCE OF HIS LETTER: ‚ÄÚONCE THAT IS ACCOMPLISHED, IT WILL BE INFINITELY MORE DIFFICULT TO GIVE SHALLOWNESS THE APPEARANCE OF PROFOUND SPEECH.‚ÄÙ ON THE CONTRARY. NOTHING SERVES AS WELL AS OBSCURITY TO MAKE SHALLOWNESS LOOK PROFOUND.

MODERN READERS WHO DO NOT KNOW FOREIGN LANGUAGES MAY WONDER WHETHER NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS ABUNDANT USE OF FRENCH PHRASES, AND OCCASIONALLY ALSO OF LATIN, GREEK, AND ITALIAN (SOMETIMES HE USES ENGLISH WORDS, TOO) DOES NOT MAKE FOR OBSCURITY. IF IT DOES, THIS IS OBSCURITY OF AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT KIND AND EASILY REMOVED‚ÄÎBY A BRIEF FOOTNOTE, FOR EXAMPLE. NIETZSCHE LIKES BREVITY AS MUCH AS HE LIKES BEING A GOOD EUROPEAN; AND HE HATES NATIONALISM AS MUCH AS HE HATES SAYING APPROXIMATELY, AT GREAT LENGTH, WHAT CAN BE SAID PRECISELY, IN ONE WORD.

ONE IS TEMPTED TO ADD THAT THE KIND OF OBSCURANTISM HE ABOMINATED INVOLVES IRREMEDIABLE AMBIGUITIES WHICH LEAD TO ENDLESS DISCUSSION, WHILE HIS TERMS, WHETHER GERMAN OR FOREIGN, ARE UNEQUIVOCAL. THAT IS TRUE UP TO A POINT‚ÄÎBUT NOT QUITE. NIETZSCHE HAD AN ALMOST PATHOLOGICAL WEAKNESS FOR ONE PARTICULAR KIND OF AMBIGUITY, WHICH, TO BE SURE, IS NOT IRREMEDIABLE: HE LOVED WORDS AND PHRASES THAT MEAN ONE THING OUT OF CONTEXT AND ALMOST THE OPPOSITE IN THE CONTEXT HE GIVES THEM. HE LOVED LANGUAGE AS POETS DO AND RELISHED THESE ‚ÄÚREVALUATIONS.‚ÄÙ ALL OF THEM INVOLVE A DOUBLE MEANING, ONE EXOTERIC AND ONE ESOTERIC, ONE‚ÄÎTO PUT IT CRUDELY‚ÄÎWRONG, AND THE OTHER RIGHT. THE FORMER IS BOUND TO LEAD ASTRAY HASTY READERS, BROWSERS, AND THAT RAPIDLY GROWING CURSE OF OUR TIME‚ÄÎTHE NON-READERS WHO DO NOT REALIZE THAT GALLOPING CONSUMPTION IS A DISEASE.

THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE KEEPS INCREASING AT INCREDIBLE SPEED, BUT THE LITERATURE OF NONKNOWLEDGE GROWS EVEN FASTER. BOOKS MULTIPLY LIKE MUSHROOMS, OR RATHER LIKE TOADSTOOLS‚ÄÎMILDEW WOULD BE STILL MORE PRECISE‚ÄÎAND EVEN THOSE WHO READ BOOKS COME PERFORCE TO DEPEND MORE AND MORE ON KNOWLEDGE ABOUT BOOKS, WRITERS, AND, IF AT ALL POSSIBLE‚ÄÎFOR THIS IS THE INTELLECTUAL, OR RATHER THE NONINTELLECTUAL, EQUIVALENT OF A BARGAIN‚ÄÎMOVEMENTS. AS LONG AS ONE KNOWS ABOUT EXISTENTIALISM, ONE CAN TALK ABOUT A LARGE NUMBER OF AUTHORS WITHOUT HAVING ACTUALLY READ THEIR BOOKS.

NIETZSCHE DIAGNOSED THIS DISEASE IN ITS EARLY STAGES, LONG BEFORE IT HAD REACHED ITS PRESENT PROPORTIONS‚ÄÎYET WROTE IN A MANNER THAT INSURED HIS BEING MISUNDERSTOOD BY THE KIND OF READER AND NONREADER HE DESPISED. WHY? HE GAVE REASONS MORE THAN ONCE; FOR EXAMPLE, IN BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, SECTIONS 30, 40, 230, 270, 278, 289, AND 290, AND IN THE AFOREMENTIONED SECTION 381 OF THE GAY SCIENCE. AND I HAVE ATTEMPTED A DIFFERENT SORT OF EXPLANATION IN AN ESSAY ON ‚ÄÚPHILOSOPHY VERSUS POETRY.‚ÄÙ3

THE GENEALOGY CONTAINS SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF MISLEADING SLOGANS, BUT RESSENTIMENT IS ACTUALLY NOT ONE OF THEM. THAT TERM IS UNIVOCAL, BUT‚ÄÎTO ASK THIS ONCE MORE‚ÄÎWHY COULDN‚ÄÔT WE SUBSTITUTE ‚ÄÚRESENTMENT‚ÄÙ FOR IT IN AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION? APART FROM THE FACT THAT SOMETHING OF THE FLAVOR OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS STYLE AND THOUGHT WOULD BE LOST, THIS IS A POINT AT WHICH NIETZSCHE SUCCEEDED IN TEACHING PSYCHOLOGY TO SPEAK‚ÄÎNIETZSCHEAN. HIS CONCEPTION OF RESSENTIMENT CONSTITUTES ONE OF HIS MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO PSYCHOLOGY‚ÄÎAND HELPS TO ILLUMINATE THE WIDESPREAD MISUNDERSTANDING OF NIETZSCHE.

TO BEGIN WITH THE FIRST POINT: AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS OWN LENGTHY ESSAY ON ‚ÄÚ[THE ROLE OF] RESSENTIMENT IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF MORALITIES,‚ÄÙ4 MAX SCHELER SAYS: ‚ÄÚAMONG THE EXCEEDINGLY FEW DISCOVERIES MADE IN RECENT TIMES CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF MORAL VALUE JUDGMENTS, FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS DISCOVERY OF RESSENTIMENT AS THE SOURCE OF SUCH VALUE JUDGMENTS IS THE MOST PROFOUND, EVEN IF HIS MORE SPECIFIC CLAIM THAT CHRISTIAN MORALITY AND IN PARTICULAR CHRISTIAN LOVE ARE THE FINEST ‚ÄÒFLOWER OF RESSSENTIMENT‚ÄÔ SHOULD TURN OUT TO BE FALSE.‚ÄÙ5

SCHELER, ONE OF THE OUTSTANDING GERMAN PHILOSOPHERS OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, CONVERTED TO ROMAN CATHOLICISM AND PERSUADED SOME OF HIS DISCIPLES TO FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE‚ÄÎBUT LATER ABANDONED CHRISTIANITY AS WELL AS ALL THEISM. IN THE ESSAY ON RESSENTIMENT HE ARGUED: ‚ÄÚWE BELIEVE THAT CHRISTIAN VALUES ARE PARTICULARLY PRONE TO BEING REINTERPRETED INTO VALUES OF RESSENTIMENT AND HAVE ALSO BEEN UNDERSTOOD THAT WAY PARTICULARLY OFTEN, BUT THAT THE CORE OF CHRISTIAN ETHICS DID NOT GROW ON THE SOIL OF RESSENTIMENT. YET WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE CORE OF BOURGEOIS MORALITY, WHICH SINCE THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY HAS BEGUN MORE AND MORE TO SUPERSEDE CHRISTIAN MORALITY UNTIL IT ATTAINED ITS SUPREME ACHIEVEMENT IN THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, DOES HAVE ITS ROOTS IN RESSENTIMENT‚ÄÙ EVEN WHERE HE DISAGREED WITH NIETZSCHE, SCHELER EMPHASIZED THAT HE CONSIDERED NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS ACCOUNT SINGULARLY PROFOUND AND WORTHY OF THE MOST SERIOUS CONSIDERATION.6

READERS READY TO JUMP TO THE CONCLUSION THAT NIETZSCHE CONFOUNDED TRUE CHRISTIANITY WITH ITS BOURGEOIS MISINTERPRETATION WHILE SCHELER OBVIOUSLY UNDERSTOOD CHRISTIANITY FAR BETTER SHOULD PONDER SCHELER‚ÄÔS FOOTNOTE: ‚ÄÚTHE POSSIBLE UNITY OF STYLE OF WARLIKE AND CHRISTIAN MORALITY IS DEMONSTRATED IN DETAIL IN MY BOOK DER GENIUS DES KRIEGES UND DER DEUTSCHE KRIEG (THE GENIUS OF WAR AND THE GERMAN WAR), 1915.‚ÄÙ7 TO BE SURE, MOST CHRISTIANS IN ENGLAND, FRANCE, AND THE UNITED STATES FELT THE SAME WAY IN 1915, BUT THE QUESTION REMAINS WHETHER SCHELER‚ÄÔS READING OF CHRISTIANITY WAS NOT DESIGNED TO BE HEARD GLADLY IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, AROUND 1915, WHEN THE ESSAY ON RESSENTIMENT, TOO, APPEARED. IN ANY CASE, THIS ESSAY DOES NOT COMPARE IN ORIGINALITY AND IMPORTANCE WITH NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS GENEALOGY, BUT IT DESERVES MENTION AS AN ATTEMPT TO DEVELOP NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS IDEAS, AND IT SHOWS HOW THE TERM RESSENTIMENT HAS BECOME ESTABLISHED.

NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CONCEPTION OF RESSENTIMENT ALSO THROWS LIGHT ON THE RECEPTION OF HIS IDEAS. BY WAY OF CONTRAST, CONSIDER MAX WEBER, PERHAPS THE GREATEST SOCIOLOGIST OF THE CENTURY, AND CERTAINLY ONE OF THE GREATEST. WEBER‚ÄÔS SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION OWES A GREAT DEAL TO NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS GENEALOGY. BUT WHY IS IT GENERALLY RECOGNIZED THAT WEBER WAS BY NO MEANS AN ANTI-SEMITE, ALTHOUGH HE FOUND THE CLUE TO THE JEWISH RELIGION IN THE ALLEGED FACT THAT THE JEWS WERE A PARIAH PEOPLE, WHILE NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS COMMENTS ON SLAVE MORALITY AND THE SLAVE REBELLION IN MORALS HAVE SO OFTEN BEEN CONSIDERED HIGHLY OFFENSIVE AND TINGED BY ANTI-SEMITISM? (NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS MANY REFERENCES TO ANTI-SEMITISM ARE INVARIABLY SCATHING: SEE THE INDICES IN THIS VOLUME.) COULD IT BE THAT A SCHOLAR IS GIVEN THE BENEFIT OF EVERY DOUBT SO LONG AS HE DOES NOT HAVE THE PRESUMPTION TO WRITE WELL?

TO WRITE ABOUT NIETZSCHE ‚ÄÚSCHOLARS‚ÄÙ WITH THE LACK OF INHIBITION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT NIETZSCHE, MIXING MORALISTIC DENUNCIATIONS WITH ATTEMPTS AT PSYCHIATRIC EXPLANATIONS, WOULD BE UTTERLY UNTHINKABLE. WHY? THE ANSWER IS CLEARLY NOT THAT NIETZSCHE REALLY WAS AN INFERIOR SCHOLAR AND DID EVENTUALLY BECOME INSANE. MOST NIETZSCHE ‚ÄÚSCHOLARS‚ÄÙ CANNOT HOLD A CANDLE TO HIS LEARNING OR ORIGINALITY, AND THE CLOSER THEY ARE TO MERITING PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPLANATIONS, THE WORSE IT WOULD BE TO OFFER ANY.

COULD THE REASON FOR THE DISPARITY IN TREATMENT BE THAT NIETZSCHE IS DEAD? WE ARE IN NO DANGER OF HURTING HIS FEELINGS OR HIS CAREER; AND HE CANNOT HIT BACK. HE IS NO LONGER A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY; HE HAS LEFT US AND IS FAIR GAME. BUT MAX WEBER IS DEAD, TOO; YET HE IS STILL TREATED AS A MEMBER OF THE GUILD. CLEARLY, THERE MUST BE ANOTHER REASON. NIETZSCHE WROTE TOO WELL AND WAS TOO SUPERIOR. THAT REMOVED HIM FROM THE IMMUNITY OF OUR COMMUNITY, QUITE AS MUCH AS THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME. BUT WHERE THE TRANSGRESSION HAS BEEN SPIRITUAL OR INTELLECTUAL, AND THOSE OFFENDED ARE THE INTELLECTUAL COMMUNITY, THE REVENGE, TOO, IS INTELLECTUAL. THE PENT-UP RESENTMENT AGAINST FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY‚ÄÎSLOPPY SCHOLARS AND WRITERS AS WELL AS THOSE WHO EXCITE ENVY‚ÄÎALL THIS RANCOR THAT CANNOT BE VENTED AGAINST LIVING COLLEAGUES, AT LEAST NOT IN PRINT, MAY BE POURED OUT AGAINST A FEW GREAT SCAPEGOATS.

THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS BEING ONE OF THE GREAT SCAPEGOATS OF ALL TIME. DURING WORLD WAR I BRITISH INTELLECTUALS FOUND IT CONVENIENT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE WAR EFFORT BY DENOUNCING A GERMAN INTELLECTUAL OF STATURE WHOM ONE COULD DISCUSS IN PRINT WITHOUT LOSING A LOT OF TIME READING HIM‚ÄÎAND NIETZSCHE HAD SAID MANY NASTY THINGS ABOUT THE BRITISH.8 HENCEFORTH NIETZSCHE WAS A MARKED MAN, AND WORLD WAR II CONTRIBUTED ITS SHARE TO THIS TYPE OF DISGRACEFUL LITERATURE. BUT THERE ARE EVEN MORE SUCH STUDIES IN GERMAN‚ÄÎWHICH IS SCARCELY SURPRISING. AFTER ALL, NIETZSCHE SAID FAR MORE WICKED THINGS‚ÄÎINCOMPARABLY MORE AND WORSE‚ÄÎABOUT THE GERMANS THAN HE EVER DID ABOUT THE BRITISH. AND AS THE LITERATURE SHOWS US BEYOND A DOUBT: CHRISTIAN SCHOLARS ALSO NEEDED OUTLETS FOR THEIR RANCOR. FOR ALL THAT, IT WOULD BE WRONG TO THINK IN TERMS OF ANY STRICT TIT-FOR-TAT, AS IF EACH GROUP THE DEAD MAN HAD OFFENDED THEN FELT JUSTIFIED IN HITTING BACK ONCE HE WAS DEAD. ONCE IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT THIS WRITER WAS A SCAPEGOAT, ANYBODY WAS ALLOWED TO PLAY AND VENT HIS OWN RESSENTIMENT ON HIM, NO MATTER WHAT ITS SOURCE.

APART FROM THESE CONSIDERATIONS, NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS RECEPTION CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD. TO BE SURE, REACTIONS OF THAT SORT DO NOT EXHAUST THIS STORY. THERE IS ALSO NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS INFLUENCE ON RILKE AND GERMAN POETRY, ON THOMAS MANN AND THE GERMAN NOVEL, ON KARL JASPERS AND GERMAN PHILOSOPHY, ON GIDE AND MALRAUX, SARTRE AND CAMUS, FREUD AND BUBER, SHAW AND YEATS. BUT TO UNDERSTAND THAT, ONE ONLY HAS TO READ THEM‚ÄÎAND HIM.

ONE FINAL WORD ABOUT THE CONTENTS AND SPIRIT OF THE GENEALOGY. ALL THREE INQUIRIES DEAL WITH THE ORIGINS OF MORAL PHENOMENA, AS THE TITLE OF THE BOOK INDICATES. THE FIRST ESSAY, WHICH CONTRASTS ‚ÄÚGOOD AND EVIL‚ÄÙ WITH ‚ÄÚGOOD AND BAD,‚ÄÙ JUXTAPOSES MASTER AND SLAVE MORALITY; THE SECOND ESSAY CONSIDERS ‚ÄÚGUILT,‚ÄÙ THE ‚ÄÚBAD CONSCIENCE,‚ÄÙ AND RELATED MATTERS; AND THE THIRD, ASCETIC IDEALS. THE MOST COMMON MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE BOOK IS SURELY TO SUPPOSE THAT NIETZSCHE CONSIDERS SLAVE MORALITY, THE BAD CONSCIENCE, AND ASCETIC IDEALS EVIL; THAT HE SUGGESTS THAT MANKIND WOULD BE BETTER OFF IF ONLY THESE THINGS HAD NEVER APPEARED; AND THAT IN EFFECT HE GLORIFIES UNCONSCIONABLE BRUTES.

ANY SUCH VIEW IS WRONG IN DETAIL AND CAN BE REFUTED BOTH BY CONSIDERING IN CONTEXT THE TRUNCATED QUOTATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDUCED TO BUTTRESS IT AND BY CITING A LARGE NUMBER OF OTHER PASSAGES. I HAVE TRIED TO DO THIS IN MY BOOK ON NIETZSCHE,9 AND THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO REPEAT THE DEMONSTRATION. BUT THIS SORT OF MISINTERPRETATION INVOLVES NOT ONLY HUNDREDS OF PARTICULAR MISREADINGS, IT ALSO INVOLVES A MISREADING OF THE GENEALOGY AND, EVEN MORE GENERALLY, OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS ATTITUDE TOWARD HISTORY AND THE WORLD. IN CONCLUSION, SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE SAID ABOUT THAT.

THE GENEALOGY IS INTENDED AS A SUPPLEMENT AND CLARIFICATION OF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL. AND WHILE THAT TITLE SUGGESTS AN ATTEMPT TO RISE ABOVE THE SLAVE MORALITY THAT CONTRASTS GOOD AND EVIL, IT ALSO SIGNIFIES A VERY BROAD ATTACK ON ‚ÄÚTHE FAITH IN OPPOSITE VALUES‚ÄÙ10 DECIDEDLY, IT IS NOT NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CONCERN IN THE GENEALOGY TO TELL US THAT MASTER MORALITY IS GOOD, WHILE SLAVE MORALITY IS EVIL; OR TO PERSUADE US THAT THE BAD CONSCIENCE AND ASCETIC IDEALS ARE BAD, WHILE A BRUTISH STATE ANTEDATING BOTH PHENOMENA IS GOOD. OF COURSE, IT IS HIS PLAN TO OPEN NEW PERSPECTIVES AND TO MAKE US SEE WHAT HE DISCUSSES IN UNWONTED, DIFFERENT WAYS. IF YOU ARE BENT ON USING TERMS LIKE GOOD AND BAD, YOU MIGHT SAY THAT HE TRIES TO SHOW US, AMONG OTHER THINGS, HOW MORAL VALUATIONS, PHENOMENA, AND IDEALS THAT ARE USUALLY NOT QUESTIONED HAVE THEIR BAD OR DARK SIDE. ORDINARILY, WE SEE THE FOREGROUND ONLY; NIETZSCHE SEEKS TO SHOW US THE BACKGROUND.

IN A NUTSHELL: WHEN NIETZSCHE HAS SHOWN US THE DARK SIDE OF THE BAD CONSCIENCE, HE SAYS, ‚ÄÚTHE BAD CONSCIENCE IS AN ILLNESS, THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT, BUT AN ILLNESS AS PREGNANCY IS AN ILLNESS‚ÄÙ (II, SECTION 19). HIS LOVE OF FATE, HIS AMOR FATI, SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN. THE SECOND CHAPTER OF ECCE HOMO ENDS: ‚ÄÚMY FORMULA FOR GREATNESS IN A HUMAN BEING IS AMOR FATI: THAT ONE WANTS NOTHING TO BE DIFFERENT, NOT FORWARD, NOT BACKWARD, NOT IN ALL ETERNITY. NOT MERELY TO BEAR WHAT IS NECESSARY, STILL LESS CONCEAL IT‚ÄÎALL IDEALISM IS MENDACIOUSNESS IN THE FACE OF WHAT IS NECESSARY‚ÄÎBUT LOVE IT.‚ÄÙ

IN THE IMAGERY OF THE FIRST CHAPTER OF ZARATHUSTRA, IT IS NOT NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS INTENTION TO MALIGN OR TO GLORIFY EITHER THE CAMEL OR THE LION‚ÄÎEITHER THE ASCETIC ‚ÄÚSPIRIT THAT WOULD BEAR MUCH, AND KNEELS DOWN LIKE A CAMEL‚ÄÙ OR THE BLOND BEAST. INDEED, ZARATHUSTRA IS ELOQUENT IN HIS PRAISE OF THE CAMEL, AND IT IS PLAIN THAT MUCH OF HIS DESCRIPTION FITS NIETZSCHE HIMSELF, WHO WAS CERTAINLY NO STRANGER TO ASCETIC IDEALS. BUT THE POINT IS THAT BOTH CAMEL AND LION REPRESENT MERE STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPIRIT; AND INSOFAR AS NIETZSCHE FEELS DISSATISFIED WITH BOTH, IT IS BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT HAVE US SETTLE FOR EITHER: HE WANTS US TO CLIMB HIGHER‚ÄÎWHICH, HOWEVER, CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT PASSING THROUGH THESE STAGES. AND WHAT LIES BEYOND? WHAT IS THE GOAL? HERE WE RETURN TO THE IMAGE OF PREGNANCY: THE THIRD STAGE IS REPRESENTED BY THE CHILD. ‚ÄÚTHE CHILD IS INNOCENCE AND FORGETTING, A NEW BEGINNING, A GAME, A SELF-PROPELLED WHEEL, A FIRST MOVEMENT, A SACRED ‚ÄÒYES.‚ÄÔ FOR THE GAME OF CREATION, MY BROTHERS, A SACRED ‚ÄÒYES‚ÄÔ IS NEEDED.‚ÄÙ

WITHOUT ACQUIRING A BAD CONSCIENCE, WITHOUT LEARNING TO BE PROFOUNDLY DISSATISFIED WITH OURSELVES, WE CANNOT ENVISAGE HIGHER NORMS, A NEW STATE OF BEING, SELF-PERFECTION. WITHOUT ASCETIC IDEALS, WITHOUT SELF-CONTROL AND CRUEL SELF-DISCIPLINE, WE CANNOT ATTAIN THAT SELF-MASTERY WHICH NIETZSCHE EVER PRAISES AND ADMIRES. BUT TO SETTLE DOWN WITH A NAGGING BAD CONSCIENCE, TO REMAIN AN ASCETIC AND MORTIFY ONESELF, IS TO FALL SHORT OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚDIONYSIAN‚ÄÙ VISION. WHAT HE CELEBRATES IS NEITHER THE CAMEL NOR THE LION BUT THE CREATOR.

‚ÄÚGOETHE‚Ä¶FOUGHT THE MUTUAL EXTRANEOUSNESS OF REASON, SENSES, FEELING, AND WILL‚Ä¶HE DISCIPLINED HIMSELF INTO WHOLENESS, HE CREATED HIMSELF‚Ä¶. SUCH A SPIRIT WHO HAS BECOME FREE STANDS AMID THE COSMOS WITH A JOYOUS AND TRUSTING FATALISM, IN THE FAITH‚Ä¶ THAT ALL IS REDEEMED AND AFFIRMED IN THE WHOLE‚ÄÎHE DOES NOT NEGATE ANY MORE. SUCH A FAITH, HOWEVER, IS THE HIGHEST OF ALL POSSIBLE FAITHS: I HAVE BAPTIZED IT WITH THE NAME OF DIONYSUS.‚ÄÙ11

WE ARE UNKNOWN TO OURSELVES, WE MEN OF KNOWLEDGE‚ÄÎAND WITH GOOD REASON. WE HAVE NEVER SOUGHT OURSELVES‚ÄÎHOW COULD IT HAPPEN THAT WE SHOULD EVER FIND OURSELVES? IT HAS RIGHTLY BEEN SAID: ‚ÄÚWHERE YOUR TREASURE IS, THERE WILL YOUR HEART BE ALSO‚ÄÙ;1 OUR TREASURE IS WHERE THE BEEHIVES OF OUR KNOWLEDGE ARE. WE ARE CONSTANTLY MAKING FOR THEM, BEING BY NATURE WINGED CREATURES AND HONEY-GATHERERS OF THE SPIRIT; THERE IS ONE THING ALONE WE REALLY CARE ABOUT FROM THE HEART‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚBRINGING SOMETHING HOME.‚ÄÙ WHATEVER ELSE THERE IS IN LIFE, SO-CALLED ‚ÄÚEXPERIENCES‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWHICH OF US HAS SUFFICIENT EARNESTNESS FOR THEM? OR SUFFICIENT TIME? PRESENT EXPERIENCE HAS, I AM AFRAID, ALWAYS FOUND US ‚ÄÚABSENT-MINDED‚ÄÙ: WE CANNOT GIVE OUR HEARTS TO IT‚ÄÎNOT EVEN OUR EARS! RATHER, AS ONE DIVINELY PREOCCUPIED AND IMMERSED IN HIMSELF INTO WHOSE EAR THE BELL HAS JUST BOOMED WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH THE TWELVE BEATS OF NOON SUDDENLY STARTS UP AND ASKS HIMSELF: ‚ÄÚWHAT REALLY WAS THAT WHICH JUST STRUCK?‚ÄÙ SO WE SOMETIMES RUB OUR EARS AFTERWARD AND ASK, UTTERLY SURPRISED AND DISCONCERTED, ‚ÄÚWHAT REALLY WAS THAT WHICH WE HAVE JUST EXPERIENCED?‚ÄÙ AND MOREOVER: ‚ÄÚWHO ARE WE REALLY?‚ÄÙ AND, AFTERWARD AS AFORESAID, COUNT THE TWELVE TREMBLING BELL-STROKES OF OUR EXPERIENCE, OUR LIFE, OUR BEING‚ÄÎAND ALAS! MISCOUNT THEM.‚ÄÎSO WE ARE NECESSARILY STRANGERS TO OURSELVES, WE DO NOT COMPREHEND OURSELVES, WE HAVE TO MISUNDERSTAND OURSELVES, FOR US THE LAW ‚ÄÚEACH IS FURTHEST FROM HIMSELF‚ÄÙ APPLIES TO ALL ETERNITY‚ÄÎWE ARE NOT ‚ÄÚMEN OF KNOWLEDGE‚ÄÙ WITH RESPECT TO OURSELVES.

MY IDEAS ON THE ORIGIN OF OUR MORAL PREJUDICES‚ÄÎFOR THIS IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS POLEMIC‚ÄÎRECEIVED THEIR FIRST, BRIEF, AND PROVISIONAL EXPRESSION IN THE COLLECTION OF APHORISMS THAT BEARS THE TITLE HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN. A BOOK FOR FREE SPIRITS. THIS BOOK WAS BEGUN IN SORRENTO DURING A WINTER WHEN IT WAS GIVEN TO ME TO PAUSE AS A WANDERER PAUSES AND LOOK BACK ACROSS THE BROAD AND DANGEROUS COUNTRY MY SPIRIT HAD TRAVERSED UP TO THAT TIME. THIS WAS IN THE WINTER OF 1876-77; THE IDEAS THEMSELVES ARE OLDER. THEY WERE ALREADY IN ESSENTIALS THE SAME IDEAS THAT I TAKE UP AGAIN IN THE PRESENT TREATISES‚ÄÎLET US HOPE THE LONG INTERVAL HAS DONE THEM GOOD, THAT THEY HAVE BECOME RIPER, CLEARER, STRONGER, MORE PERFECT! THAT I STILL CLEAVE TO THEM TODAY, HOWEVER, THAT THEY HAVE BECOME IN THE MEANTIME MORE AND MORE FIRMLY ATTACHED TO ONE ANOTHER, INDEED ENTWINED AND INTERLACED WITH ONE ANOTHER, STRENGTHENS MY JOYFUL ASSURANCE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE ARISEN IN ME FROM THE FIRST NOT AS ISOLATED, CAPRICIOUS, OR SPORADIC THINGS BUT FROM A COMMON ROOT, FROM A FUNDAMENTAL WILL OF KNOWLEDGE, POINTING IMPERIOUSLY INTO THE DEPTHS, SPEAKING MORE AND MORE PRECISELY, DEMANDING GREATER AND GREATER PRECISION. FOR THIS ALONE IS FITTING FOR A PHILOSOPHER. WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO ISOLATED ACTS OF ANY KIND: WE MAY NOT MAKE ISOLATED ERRORS OR HIT UPON ISOLATED TRUTHS. RATHER DO OUR IDEAS, OUR VALUES, OUR YEAS AND NAYS, OUR IFS AND BUTS, GROW OUT OF US WITH THE NECESSITY WITH WHICH A TREE BEARS FRUIT‚ÄÎRELATED AND EACH WITH AN AFFINITY TO EACH, AND EVIDENCE OF ONE WILL, ONE HEALTH, ONE SOIL, ONE SUN.‚ÄÎWHETHER YOU LIKE THEM, THESE FRUITS OF OURS?‚ÄÎBUT WHAT IS THAT TO THE TREES! WHAT IS THAT TO US, TO US PHILOSOPHERS!

BECAUSE OF A SCRUPLE PECULIAR TO ME THAT I AM LOTH TO ADMIT TO‚ÄÎFOR IT IS CONCERNED WITH MORALITY, WITH ALL THAT HAS HITHERTO BEEN CELEBRATED ON EARTH AS MORALITY‚ÄÎA SCRUPLE THAT ENTERED MY LIFE SO EARLY, SO UNINVITED, SO IRRESISTIBLY, SO MUCH IN CONFLICT WITH MY ENVIRONMENT, AGE, PRECEDENTS, AND DESCENT THAT I MIGHT ALMOST HAVE THE RIGHT TO CALL IT MY ‚ÄÚA PRIORI‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎMY CURIOSITY AS WELL AS MY SUSPICIONS WERE BOUND TO HALT QUITE SOON AT THE QUESTION OF WHERE OUR GOOD AND EVIL REALLY ORIGINATED. IN FACT, THE PROBLEM OF THE ORIGIN OF EVIL PURSUED ME EVEN AS A BOY OF THIRTEEN: AT AN AGE IN WHICH YOU HAVE ‚ÄÚHALF CHILDISH TRIFLES, HALF GOD IN YOUR HEART,‚ÄÙ2 I DEVOTED TO IT MY FIRST CHILDISH LITERARY TRIFLE, MY FIRST PHILOSOPHICAL EFFORT‚ÄÎAND AS FOR THE ‚ÄÚSOLUTION‚ÄÙ OF THE PROBLEM I POSED AT THAT TIME, WELL, I GAVE THE HONOR TO GOD, AS WAS ONLY FAIR, AND MADE HIM THE FATHER OF EVIL. WAS THAT WHAT MY ‚ÄÚA PRIORI‚ÄÙ DEMANDED OF ME? THAT NEW IMMORAL, OR AT LEAST UNMORALISTIC ‚ÄÚA PRIORI‚ÄÙ AND THE ALAS! SO ANTI-KANTIAN, ENIGMATIC ‚ÄÚCATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE‚ÄÙ WHICH SPOKE THROUGH IT AND TO WHICH I HAVE SINCE LISTENED MORE AND MORE CLOSELY, AND NOT MERELY LISTENED?

FORTUNATELY I LEARNED EARLY TO SEPARATE THEOLOGICAL PREJUDICE FROM MORAL PREJUDICE AND CEASED TO LOOK FOR THE ORIGIN OF EVIL BEHIND THE WORLD. A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HISTORICAL AND PHILOLOGICAL SCHOOLING, TOGETHER WITH AN INBORN FASTIDIOUSNESS OF TASTE IN RESPECT TO PSYCHOLOGICAL QUESTIONS IN GENERAL, SOON TRANSFORMED MY PROBLEM INTO ANOTHER ONE: UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS DID MAN DEVISE THESE VALUE JUDGMENTS GOOD AND EVIL? AND WHAT VALUE DO THEY THEMSELVES POSSESS? HAVE THEY HITHERTO HINDERED OR FURTHERED HUMAN PROSPERITY? ARE THEY A SIGN OF DISTRESS, OF IMPOVERISHMENT, OF THE DEGENERATION OF LIFE? OR IS THERE REVEALED IN THEM, ON THE CONTRARY, THE PLENITUDE, FORCE, AND WILL OF LIFE, ITS COURAGE, CERTAINTY, FUTURE?

THEREUPON I DISCOVERED AND VENTURED DIVERS ANSWERS; I DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN AGES, PEOPLES, DEGREES OF RANK AMONG INDIVIDUALS; I DEPARTMENTALIZED MY PROBLEM; OUT OF MY ANSWERS THERE GREW NEW QUESTIONS, INQUIRIES, CONJECTURES, PROBABILITIES‚ÄÎUNTIL AT LENGTH I HAD A COUNTRY OF MY OWN, A SOIL OF MY OWN, AN ENTIRE DISCRETE, THRIVING, FLOURISHING WORLD, LIKE A SECRET GARDEN THE EXISTENCE OF WHICH NO ONE SUSPECTED.‚ÄÎOH HOW FORTUNATE WE ARE, WE MEN OF KNOWLEDGE, PROVIDED ONLY THAT WE KNOW HOW TO KEEP SILENT LONG ENOUGH!

THE FIRST IMPULSE TO PUBLISH SOMETHING OF MY HYPOTHESES CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF MORALITY WAS GIVEN ME BY A CLEAR, TIDY, AND SHREWD‚ÄÎALSO PRECOCIOUS‚ÄÎLITTLE BOOK IN WHICH I ENCOUNTERED DISTINCTLY FOR THE FIRST TIME AN UPSIDE-DOWN AND PERVERSE SPECIES OF GENEALOGICAL HYPOTHESIS, THE GENUINELY ENGLISH TYPE, THAT ATTRACTED ME‚ÄÎWITH THAT POWER OF ATTRACTION WHICH EVERYTHING CONTRARY, EVERYTHING ANTIPODAL POSSESSES. THE TITLE OF THE LITTLE BOOK WAS THE ORIGIN OF THE MORAL SENSATIONS; ITS AUTHOR DR. PAUL R√©E; THE YEAR IN WHICH IT APPEARED 1877. PERHAPS I HAVE NEVER READ ANYTHING TO WHICH I WOULD HAVE SAID TO MYSELF NO, PROPOSITION BY PROPOSITION, CONCLUSION BY CONCLUSION, TO THE EXTENT THAT I DID TO THIS BOOK: YET QUITE WITHOUT ILL-HUMOR OR IMPATIENCE. IN THE ABOVE-MENTIONED WORK, ON WHICH I WAS THEN ENGAGED, I MADE OPPORTUNE AND INOPPORTUNE REFERENCE TO THE PROPOSITIONS OF THAT BOOK, NOT IN ORDER TO REFUTE THEM‚ÄÎWHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH REFUTATIONS!‚ÄÎBUT, AS BECOMES A POSITIVE SPIRIT, TO REPLACE THE IMPROBABLE WITH THE MORE PROBABLE, POSSIBLY ONE ERROR WITH ANOTHER. IT WAS THEN, AS I HAVE SAID, THAT I ADVANCED FOR THE FIRST TIME THOSE GENEALOGICAL HYPOTHESES TO WHICH THIS TREATISE IS DEVOTED‚ÄÎINEPTLY, AS I SHOULD BE THE LAST TO DENY, STILL CONSTRAINED, STILL LACKING MY OWN LANGUAGE FOR MY OWN THINGS AND WITH MUCH BACKSLIDING AND VACILLATION. ONE SHOULD COMPARE IN PARTICULAR WHAT I SAY IN HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN, SECTION 45, ON THE TWOFOLD PREHISTORY OF GOOD AND EVIL (NAMELY, IN THE SPHERE OF THE NOBLE AND IN THAT OF THE SLAVES); LIKEWISE, SECTION 136, ON THE VALUE AND ORIGIN OF THE MORALITY OF ASCETICISM; LIKEWISE, SECTIONS 96 AND 99 AND VOLUME II, SECTION 89, ON THE ‚ÄÚMORALITY OF MORES,‚ÄÙ THAT MUCH OLDER AND MORE PRIMITIVE SPECIES OF MORALITY WHICH DIFFERS TOTO CAELO3 FROM THE ALTRUISTIC MODE OF EVALUATION (IN WHICH DR. R√©E, LIKE ALL ENGLISH MORAL GENEALOGISTS, SEES MORAL EVALUATION AS SUCH); LIKEWISE, SECTION 92, THE WANDERER, SECTION 26, AND DAWN, SECTION 112, ON THE ORIGIN OF JUSTICE AS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN TWO APPROXIMATELY EQUAL POWERS (EQUALITY AS THE PRESUPPOSITION OF ALL COMPACTS, CONSEQUENTLY OF ALL LAW); LIKEWISE THE WANDERER, SECTIONS 22 AND 33, ON THE ORIGIN OF PUNISHMENT, OF WHICH THE AIM OF INTIMIDATION IS NEITHER THE ESSENCE NOR THE SOURCE (AS DR. R√©E THINKS‚ÄÎIT IS RATHER ONLY INTRODUCED, UNDER CERTAIN DEFINITE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND ALWAYS AS AN INCIDENTAL, AS SOMETHING ADDED).4

EVEN THEN MY REAL CONCERN WAS SOMETHING MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN HYPOTHESIS-MONGERING, WHETHER MY OWN OR OTHER PEOPLE‚ÄÔS, ON THE ORIGIN OF MORALITY (OR MORE PRECISELY: THE LATTER CONCERNED ME SOLELY FOR THE SAKE OF A GOAL TO WHICH IT WAS ONLY ONE MEANS AMONG MANY). WHAT WAS AT STAKE WAS THE VALUE OF MORALITY‚ÄÎAND OVER THIS I HAD TO COME TO TERMS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY WITH MY GREAT TEACHER SCHOPENHAUER, TO WHOM THAT BOOK OF MINE, THE PASSION AND THE CONCEALED CONTRADICTION OF THAT BOOK, ADDRESSED ITSELF AS IF TO A CONTEMPORARY (‚ÄÎFOR THAT BOOK, TOO, WAS A ‚ÄÚPOLEMIC‚ÄÙ). WHAT WAS ESPECIALLY AT STAKE WAS THE VALUE OF THE ‚ÄÚUNEGOISTIC,‚ÄÙ THE INSTINCTS OF PITY, SELF-ABNEGATION, SELF-SACRIFICE, WHICH SCHOPENHAUER HAD GILDED, DEIFIED, AND PROJECTED INTO A BEYOND FOR SO LONG THAT AT LAST THEY BECAME FOR HIM ‚ÄÚVALUE-IN-ITSELF,‚ÄÙ ON THE BASIS OF WHICH HE SAID NO TO LIFE AND TO HIMSELF. BUT IT WAS AGAINST PRECISELY THESE INSTINCTS THAT THERE SPOKE FROM ME AN EVER MORE FUNDAMENTAL MISTRUST, AN EVER MORE CORROSIVE SKEPTICISM! IT WAS PRECISELY HERE THAT I SAW THE GREAT DANGER TO MANKIND, ITS SUBLIMEST ENTICEMENT AND SEDUCTION‚ÄÎBUT TO WHAT? TO NOTHINGNESS?‚ÄÎIT WAS PRECISELY HERE THAT I SAW THE BEGINNING OF THE END, THE DEAD STOP, A RETROSPECTIVE WEARINESS, THE WILL TURNING AGAINST LIFE, THE TENDER AND SORROWFUL SIGNS OF THE ULTIMATE ILLNESS: I UNDERSTOOD THE EVER SPREADING MORALITY OF PITY THAT HAD SEIZED EVEN ON PHILOSOPHERS AND MADE THEM ILL, AS THE MOST SINISTER SYMPTOM OF A EUROPEAN CULTURE THAT HAD ITSELF BECOME SINISTER, PERHAPS AS ITS BY-PASS TO A NEW BUDDHISM? TO A BUDDHISM FOR EUROPEANS? TO‚ÄÎNIHILISM?

FOR THIS OVERESTIMATION OF AND PREDILECTION FOR PITY ON THE PART OF MODERN PHILOSOPHERS IS SOMETHING NEW: HITHERTO PHILOSOPHERS HAVE BEEN AT ONE AS TO THE WORTHLESSNESS OF PITY. I NAME ONLY PLATO, SPINOZA, LA ROCHEFOUCAULD AND KANT‚ÄÎFOUR SPIRITS AS DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER AS POSSIBLE, BUT UNITED IN ONE THING: IN THEIR LOW ESTIMATION OF PITY.





6


THIS PROBLEM OF THE VALUE OF PITY AND OF THE MORALITY OF PITY (‚ÄÎI AM OPPOSED TO THE PERNICIOUS MODERN EFFEMINACY OF FEELING‚ÄÎ) SEEMS AT FIRST TO BE MERELY SOMETHING DETACHED, AN ISOLATED QUESTION MARK; BUT WHOEVER STICKS WITH IT AND LEARNS HOW TO ASK QUESTIONS HERE WILL EXPERIENCE WHAT I EXPERIENCED‚ÄÎA TREMENDOUS NEW PROSPECT OPENS UP FOR HIM, A NEW POSSIBILITY COMES OVER HIM LIKE A VERTIGO, EVERY KIND OF MISTRUST, SUSPICION, FEAR LEAPS UP, HIS BELIEF IN MORALITY, IN ALL MORALITY, FALTERS‚ÄÎFINALLY A NEW DEMAND BECOMES AUDIBLE. LET US ARTICULATE THIS NEW DEMAND: WE NEED A CRITIQUE OF MORAL VALUES, THE VALUE OF THESE VALUES THEMSELVES MUST FIRST BE CALLED IN QUESTION‚ÄÎAND FOR THAT THERE IS NEEDED A KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONDITIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THEY GREW, UNDER WHICH THEY EVOLVED AND CHANGED (MORALITY AS CONSEQUENCE, AS SYMPTOM, AS MASK, AS TARTUFFERIE, AS ILLNESS, AS MISUNDERSTANDING; BUT ALSO MORALITY AS CAUSE, AS REMEDY, AS STIMULANT, AS RESTRAINT, AS POISON), A KNOWLEDGE OF A KIND THAT HAS NEVER YET EXISTED OR EVEN BEEN DESIRED. ONE HAS TAKEN THE VALUE OF THESE ‚ÄÚVALUES‚ÄÙ AS GIVEN, AS FACTUAL, AS BEYOND ALL QUESTION; ONE HAS HITHERTO NEVER DOUBTED OR HESITATED IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE IN SUPPOSING ‚ÄÚTHE GOOD MAN‚ÄÙ TO BE OF GREATER VALUE THAN ‚ÄÚTHE EVIL MAN,‚ÄÙ OF GREATER VALUE IN THE SENSE OF FURTHERING THE ADVANCEMENT AND PROSPERITY OF MAN IN GENERAL (THE FUTURE OF MAN INCLUDED). BUT WHAT IF THE REVERSE WERE TRUE? WHAT IF A SYMPTOM OF REGRESSION WERE INHERENT IN THE ‚ÄÚGOOD,‚ÄÙ LIKEWISE A DANGER, A SEDUCTION, A POISON, A NARCOTIC, THROUGH WHICH THE PRESENT WAS POSSIBLY LIVING AT THE EXPENSE OF THE FUTURE? PERHAPS MORE COMFORTABLY, LESS DANGEROUSLY, BUT AT THE SAME TIME IN A MEANER STYLE, MORE BASELY?‚ÄÎSO THAT PRECISELY MORALITY WOULD BE TO BLAME IF THE HIGHEST POWER AND SPLENDOR ACTUALLY POSSIBLE TO THE TYPE MAN WAS NEVER IN FACT ATTAINED? SO THAT PRECISELY MORALITY WAS THE DANGER OF DANGERS?

LET IT SUFFICE THAT, AFTER THIS PROSPECT HAD OPENED UP BEFORE ME, I HAD REASONS TO LOOK ABOUT ME FOR SCHOLARLY, BOLD, AND INDUSTRIOUS COMRADES (I AM STILL LOOKING). THE PROJECT IS TO TRAVERSE WITH QUITE NOVEL QUESTIONS, AND AS THOUGH WITH NEW EYES, THE ENORMOUS, DISTANT, AND SO WELL HIDDEN LAND OF MORALITY‚ÄÎOF MORALITY THAT HAS ACTUALLY EXISTED, ACTUALLY BEEN LIVED; AND DOES THIS NOT MEAN VIRTUALLY TO DISCOVER THIS LAND FOR THE FIRST TIME?

IF I CONSIDERED IN THIS CONNECTION THE ABOVE-MENTIONED DR. R√©E, AMONG OTHERS, IT WAS BECAUSE I HAD NO DOUBT THAT THE VERY NATURE OF HIS INQUIRIES WOULD COMPEL HIM TO ADOPT A BETTER METHOD FOR REACHING ANSWERS. HAVE I DECEIVED MYSELF IN THIS? MY DESIRE, AT ANY RATE, WAS TO POINT OUT TO SO SHARP AND DISINTERESTED AN EYE AS HIS A BETTER DIRECTION IN WHICH TO LOOK, IN THE DIRECTION OF AN ACTUAL HISTORY OF MORALITY, AND TO WARN HIM IN TIME AGAINST GAZING AROUND HAPHAZARDLY IN THE BLUE AFTER THE ENGLISH FASHION. FOR IT MUST BE OBVIOUS WHICH COLOR IS A HUNDRED TIMES MORE VITAL FOR A GENEALOGIST OF MORALS THAN BLUE: NAMELY GRAY, THAT IS, WHAT IS DOCUMENTED, WHAT CAN ACTUALLY BE CONFIRMED AND HAS ACTUALLY EXISTED, IN SHORT THE ENTIRE LONG HIEROGLYPHIC RECORD, SO HARD TO DECIPHER, OF THE MORAL PAST OF MANKIND!

THIS WAS UNKNOWN TO DR. R√©E; BUT HE HAD READ DARWIN‚ÄÎSO THAT IN HIS HYPOTHESES, AND AFTER A FASHION THAT IS AT LEAST ENTERTAINING, THE DARWINIAN BEAST AND THE ULTRAMODERN UNASSUMING MORAL MILKSOP WHO ‚ÄÚNO LONGER BITES‚ÄÙ POLITELY LINK HANDS, THE LATTER WEARING AN EXPRESSION OF A CERTAIN GOOD-NATURED AND REFINED INDOLENCE, WITH WHICH IS MINGLED EVEN A GRAIN OF PESSIMISM AND WEARINESS, AS IF ALL THESE THINGS‚ÄÎTHE PROBLEMS OF MORALITY‚ÄÎWERE REALLY NOT WORTH TAKING QUITE SO SERIOUSLY. BUT TO ME, ON THE CONTRARY, THERE SEEMS TO BE NOTHING MORE WORTH TAKING SERIOUSLY, AMONG THE REWARDS FOR IT BEING THAT SOME DAY ONE WILL PERHAPS BE ALLOWED TO TAKE THEM CHEERFULLY. FOR CHEERFULNESS‚ÄÎOR IN MY OWN LANGUAGE GAY SCIENCE-‚ÄÎIS A REWARD: THE REWARD OF A LONG, BRAVE, INDUSTRIOUS, AND SUBTERRANEAN SERIOUSNESS, OF WHICH, TO BE SURE, NOT EVERYONE IS CAPABLE. BUT ON THE DAY WE CAN SAY WITH ALL OUR HEARTS, ‚ÄÚONWARDS! OUR OLD MORALITY TOO IS PART OF THE COMEDY!‚ÄÙ WE SHALL HAVE DISCOVERED A NEW COMPLICATION AND POSSIBILITY FOR THE DIONYSIAN DRAMA OF ‚ÄÚTHE DESTINY OF THE SOUL‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND ONE CAN WAGER THAT THE GRAND OLD ETERNAL COMIC POET OF OUR EXISTENCE WILL BE QUICK TO MAKE USE OF IT!

IF THIS BOOK IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ANYONE AND JARS ON HIS EARS, THE FAULT, IT SEEMS TO ME, IS NOT NECESSARILY MINE. IT IS CLEAR ENOUGH, ASSUMING, AS I DO ASSUME, THAT ONE HAS FIRST READ MY EARLIER WRITINGS AND HAS NOT SPARED SOME TROUBLE IN DOING SO: FOR THEY ARE, INDEED, NOT EASY TO PENETRATE.5 REGARDING MY ZARATHUSTRA, FOR EXAMPLE, I DO NOT ALLOW THAT ANYONE KNOWS THAT BOOK WHO HAS NOT AT SOME TIME BEEN PROFOUNDLY WOUNDED AND AT SOME TIME PROFOUNDLY DELIGHTED BY EVERY WORD IN IT; FOR ONLY THEN MAY HE ENJOY THE PRIVILEGE OF REVERENTIALLY SHARING IN THE HALCYON ELEMENT OUT OF WHICH THAT BOOK WAS BORN AND IN ITS SUNLIGHT CLARITY, REMOTENESS, BREADTH, AND CERTAINTY. IN OTHER CASES, PEOPLE FIND DIFFICULTY WITH THE APHORISTIC FORM: THIS ARISES FROM THE FACT THAT TODAY THIS FORM IS NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY ENOUGH. AN APHORISM, PROPERLY STAMPED AND MOLDED, HAS NOT BEEN ‚ÄÚDECIPHERED‚ÄÙ WHEN IT HAS SIMPLY BEEN READ; RATHER, ONE HAS THEN TO BEGIN ITS EXEGESIS, FOR WHICH IS REQUIRED AN ART OF EXEGESIS. I HAVE OFFERED IN THE THIRD ESSAY OF THE PRESENT BOOK AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT I REGARD AS ‚ÄÚEXEGESIS‚ÄÙ IN SUCH A CASE‚ÄÎAN APHORISM IS PREFIXED TO THIS ESSAY, THE ESSAY ITSELF IS A COMMENTARY ON IT. TO BE SURE, ONE THING IS NECESSARY ABOVE ALL IF ONE IS TO PRACTICE READING AS AN ART IN THIS WAY, SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN UNLEARNED MOST THOROUGHLY NOWADAYS‚ÄÎAND THEREFORE IT WILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE MY WRITINGS ARE ‚ÄÚREADABLE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎSOMETHING FOR WHICH ONE HAS ALMOST TO BE A COW AND IN ANY CASE NOT A ‚ÄÚMODERN MAN‚ÄÙ: RUMINATION.

CF. BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, MY NOTE ON SECTION 250.

YET ARTHUR DANTO VOICES A VERY COMMON ASSUMPTION WHEN HE SAYS ON THE FIRST PAGE OF THE FIRST CHAPTER OF HIS NIETZSCHE AS PHILOSOPHER (NEW YORK, MACMILLAN, 1965): ‚ÄÚNO ONE OF THEM [I.E., NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS BOOKS] PRESUPPOSES AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH ANY OTHER‚Ä¶HIS WRITINGS MAY BE READ IN PRETTY MUCH ANY ORDER, WITHOUT THIS GREATLY IMPEDING THE COMPREHENSION OF HIS IDEAS.‚ÄÙ THIS IS AS WRONG AS DANTO‚ÄÔS CLAIM ON THE SAME PAGE THAT ‚ÄÚIT WOULD BE DIFFICULT EVEN FOR A CLOSE READER TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE WORKS HE [NIETZSCHE] SAW THROUGH THE PRESS [E.G., THE GENEALOGY] AND THOSE [SIC] PIECED TOGETHER BY HIS EDITORS [I.E., THE WILL TO POWER].‚ÄÙ INDEED, DANTO, LIKE MOST READERS, APPROACHES NIETZSCHE AS IF ‚ÄÚANY GIVEN APHORISM OR ESSAY MIGHT AS EASILY HAVE BEEN PLACED IN ONE VOLUME AS IN ANOTHER;‚ÄÙ HE BASES HIS DISCUSSIONS ON SHORT SNIPPETS, TORN FROM THEIR CONTEXT, AND FREQUENTLY OMITS PHRASES WITHOUT INDICATING THAT HE HAS DONE SO; AND HE DOES NOT BOTHER TO CONSIDER ALL OR MOST OF THE PASSAGES THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THE TOPICS HE DISCUSSES.

THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW BOOKS IN ENGLISH THAT DEAL WITH NIETZSCHE AS A PHILOSOPHER, AND DANTO‚ÄÔS STANDING AS A PHILOSOPHER INSPIRES CONFIDENCE; BUT HIS ACCOUNT OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS MORAL AND EPISTEMOLOGICAL IDEAS UNFORTUNATELY DEPENDS ON THIS UNTENABLE APPROACH.

THESE ENGLISH PSYCHOLOGISTS, WHOM ONE HAS ALSO TO THANK FOR THE ONLY ATTEMPTS HITHERTO TO ARRIVE AT A HISTORY OF THE ORIGIN OF MORALITY‚ÄÎTHEY THEMSELVES ARE NO EASY RIDDLE; I CONFESS THAT, AS LIVING RIDDLES, THEY EVEN POSSESS ONE ESSENTIAL ADVANTAGE OVER THEIR BOOKS‚ÄÎTHEY ARE INTERESTING! THESE ENGLISH PSYCHOLOGISTS‚ÄÎWHAT DO THEY REALLY WANT? ONE ALWAYS DISCOVERS THEM VOLUNTARILY OR INVOLUNTARILY AT THE SAME TASK, NAMELY AT DRAGGING THE PARTIE HONTEUSE1 OF OUR INNER WORLD INTO THE FOREGROUND AND SEEKING THE TRULY EFFECTIVE AND DIRECTING AGENT, THAT WHICH HAS BEEN DECISIVE IN ITS EVOLUTION, IN JUST THAT PLACE WHERE THE INTELLECTUAL PRIDE OF MAN WOULD LEAST DESIRE TO FIND IT (IN THE VIS INERTIAE2 OF HABIT, FOR EXAMPLE, OR IN FORGETFULNESS, OR IN A BLIND AND CHANCE MECHANISTIC HOOKING-TOGETHER OF IDEAS, OR IN SOMETHING PURELY PASSIVE, AUTOMATIC, REFLEXIVE, MOLECULAR, AND THOROUGHLY STUPID)‚ÄÎWHAT IS IT REALLY THAT ALWAYS DRIVES THESE PSYCHOLOGISTS IN JUST THIS DIRECTION? IS IT A SECRET, MALICIOUS, VULGAR, PERHAPS SELF-DECEIVING INSTINCT FOR BELITTLING MAN? OR POSSIBLY A PESSIMISTIC SUSPICION, THE MISTRUSTFULNESS OF DISAPPOINTED IDEALISTS GROWN SPITEFUL AND GLOOMY? OR A PETTY SUBTERRANEAN HOSTILITY AND RANCOR TOWARD CHRISTIANITY (AND PLATO) THAT HAS PERHAPS NOT EVEN CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF CONSCIOUSNESS? OR EVEN A LASCIVIOUS TASTE FOR THE GROTESQUE, THE PAINFULLY PARADOXICAL, THE QUESTIONABLE AND ABSURD IN EXISTENCE? OR FINALLY‚ÄÎSOMETHING OF EACH OF THEM, A LITTLE VULGARITY, A LITTLE GLOOMINESS, A LITTLE ANTI-CHRISTIANITY, A LITTLE ITCHING AND NEED FOR SPICE?

BUT I AM TOLD THEY ARE SIMPLY OLD, COLD, AND TEDIOUS FROGS, CREEPING AROUND MEN AND INTO MEN AS IF IN THEIR OWN PROPER ELEMENT, THAT IS, IN A SWAMP. I REBEL AT THAT IDEA; MORE, I DO NOT BELIEVE IT; AND IF ONE MAY BE ALLOWED TO HOPE WHERE ONE DOES NOT KNOW, THEN I HOPE FROM MY HEART THEY MAY BE THE REVERSE OF THIS‚ÄÎTHAT THESE INVESTIGATORS AND MICROSCOPISTS OF THE SOUL MAY BE FUNDAMENTALLY BRAVE, PROUD, AND MAGNANIMOUS ANIMALS, WHO KNOW HOW TO KEEP THEIR HEARTS AS WELL AS THEIR SUFFERINGS IN BOUNDS AND HAVE TRAINED THEMSELVES TO SACRIFICE ALL DESIRABILITY TO TRUTH, EVERY TRUTH, EVEN PLAIN, HARSH, UGLY, REPELLENT, UNCHRISTIAN, IMMORAL TRUTH.‚ÄÎFOR SUCH TRUTHS DO EXIST.‚ÄÎ

ALL RESPECT THEN FOR THE GOOD SPIRITS THAT MAY RULE IN THESE HISTORIANS OF MORALITY! BUT IT IS, UNHAPPILY, CERTAIN THAT THE HISTORICAL SPIRIT ITSELF IS LACKING IN THEM, THAT PRECISELY ALL THE GOOD SPIRITS OF HISTORY ITSELF HAVE LEFT THEM IN THE LURCH! AS IS THE HALLOWED CUSTOM WITH PHILOSOPHERS, THE THINKING OF ALL OF THEM IS BY NATURE UNHISTORICAL; THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. THE WAY THEY HAVE BUNGLED THEIR MORAL GENEALOGY COMES TO LIGHT AT THE VERY BEGINNING, WHERE THE TASK IS TO INVESTIGATE THE ORIGIN OF THE CONCEPT AND JUDGMENT ‚ÄÚGOOD.‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚORIGINALLY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎSO THEY DECREE‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚONE APPROVED UN-EGOISTIC ACTIONS AND CALLED THEM GOOD FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THOSE TO WHOM THEY WERE DONE, THAT IS TO SAY, THOSE TO WHOM THEY WERE USEFUL; LATER ONE FORGOT HOW THIS APPROVAL ORIGINATED AND, SIMPLY BECAUSE UNEGOISTIC ACTIONS WERE ALWAYS HABITUALLY PRAISED AS GOOD, ONE ALSO FELT THEM TO BE GOOD‚ÄÎAS IF THEY WERE SOMETHING GOOD IN THEMSELVES.‚ÄÙ ONE SEES STRAIGHTAWAY THAT THIS PRIMARY DERIVATION ALREADY CONTAINS ALL THE TYPICAL TRAITS OF THE IDIOSYNCRASY OF THE ENGLISH PSYCHOLOGISTS‚ÄÎWE HAVE ‚ÄÚUTILITY,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚFORGETTING,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚHABIT,‚ÄÙ AND FINALLY ‚ÄÚERROR,‚ÄÙ ALL AS THE BASIS OF AN EVALUATION OF WHICH THE HIGHER MAN HAS HITHERTO BEEN PROUD AS THOUGH IT WERE A KIND OF PREROGATIVE OF MAN AS SUCH. THIS PRIDE HAS TO BE HUMBLED, THIS EVALUATION DISVALUED: HAS THAT END BEEN ACHIEVED?

NOW IT IS PLAIN TO ME, FIRST OF ALL, THAT IN THIS THEORY THE SOURCE OF THE CONCEPT ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ HAS BEEN SOUGHT AND ESTABLISHED IN THE WRONG PLACE: THE JUDGMENT ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ DID NOT ORIGINATE WITH THOSE TO WHOM ‚ÄÚGOODNESS‚ÄÙ WAS SHOWN! RATHER IT WAS ‚ÄÚTHE GOOD‚ÄÙ THEMSELVES, SELVES, THAT IS TO SAY, THE NOBLE, POWERFUL, HIGH-STATIONED AND HIGH-MINDED, WHO FELT AND ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES AND THEIR ACTIONS AS GOOD, THAT IS, OF THE FIRST RANK, IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO ALL THE LOW, LOW-MINDED, COMMON AND PLEBEIAN. IT WAS OUT OF THIS PATHOS OF DISTANCE1 THAT THEY FIRST SEIZED THE RIGHT TO CREATE VALUES AND TO COIN NAMES FOR VALUES: WHAT HAD THEY TO DO WITH UTILITY! THE VIEWPOINT OF UTILITY IS AS REMOTE AND INAPPROPRIATE AS IT POSSIBLY COULD BE IN FACE OF SUCH A BURNING ERUPTION OF THE HIGHEST RANK-ORDERING, RANK-DEFINING VALUE JUDGMENTS: FOR HERE FEELING HAS ATTAINED THE ANTITHESIS OF THAT LOW DEGREE OF WARMTH WHICH ANY CALCULATING PRUDENCE, ANY CALCULUS OF UTILITY, PRESUPPOSES‚ÄÎAND NOT FOR ONCE ONLY, NOT FOR AN EXCEPTIONAL HOUR, BUT FOR GOOD. THE PATHOS OF NOBILITY AND DISTANCE, AS AFORESAID, THE PROTRACTED AND DOMINEERING FUNDAMENTAL TOTAL FEELING ON THE PART OF A HIGHER RULING ORDER IN RELATION TO A LOWER ORDER, TO A ‚ÄÚBELOW‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THE ANTITHESIS ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚBAD.‚ÄÙ (THE LORDLY RIGHT OF GIVING NAMES EXTENDS SO FAR THAT ONE SHOULD ALLOW ONESELF TO CONCEIVE THE ORIGIN OF LANGUAGE ITSELF AS AN EXPRESSION OF POWER ON THE PART OF THE RULERS: THEY SAY ‚ÄÚTHIS IS THIS AND THIS,‚ÄÙ THEY SEAL EVERY THING AND EVENT WITH A SOUND AND, AS IT WERE, TAKE POSSESSION OF IT.) IT FOLLOWS FROM THIS ORIGIN THAT THE WORD ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ WAS DEFINITELY NOT LINKED FROM THE FIRST AND BY NECESSITY TO ‚ÄÚUNEGOISTIC‚ÄÙ ACTIONS, AS THE SUPERSTITION OF THESE GENEALOGISTS OF MORALITY WOULD HAVE IT. RATHER IT WAS ONLY WHEN ARISTOCRATIC VALUE JUDGMENTS DECLINED THAT THE WHOLE ANTITHESIS ‚ÄÚEGOISTIC‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚUNEGOISTIC‚ÄÙ OBTRUDED ITSELF MORE AND MORE ON THE HUMAN CONSCIENCE‚ÄÎIT IS, TO SPEAK IN MY OWN LANGUAGE, THE HERD INSTINCT THAT THROUGH THIS ANTITHESIS AT LAST GETS ITS WORD (AND ITS WORDS) IN. AND EVEN THEN IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE THAT INSTINCT ATTAINED SUCH DOMINION THAT MORAL EVALUATION WAS ACTUALLY STUCK AND HALTED AT THIS ANTITHESIS (AS, FOR EXAMPLE, IS THE CASE IN CONTEMPORARY EUROPE: THE PREJUDICE THAT TAKES ‚ÄÚMORAL,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚUNEGOISTIC,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚD√©SINT√©RESS√©‚ÄÙ AS CONCEPTS OF EQUIVALENT VALUE ALREADY RULES TODAY WITH THE FORCE OF A ‚ÄÚFIXED IDEA‚ÄÙ AND BRAIN-SICKNESS).

IN THE SECOND PLACE, HOWEVER: QUITE APART FROM THE HISTORICAL UNTENABILITY OF THIS HYPOTHESIS REGARDING THE ORIGIN OF THE VALUE JUDGMENT ‚ÄÚGOOD,‚ÄÙ IT SUFFERS FROM AN INHERENT PSYCHOLOGICAL ABSURDITY. THE UTILITY OF THE UNEGOISTIC ACTION IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE APPROVAL ACCORDED IT, AND THIS SOURCE IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN‚ÄÎBUT HOW IS THIS FORGETTING POSSIBLE? HAS THE UTILITY OF SUCH ACTIONS COME TO AN END AT SOME TIME OR OTHER? THE OPPOSITE IS THE CASE: THIS UTILITY HAS RATHER BEEN AN EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE AT ALL TIMES, THEREFORE SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN UNDERLINED AGAIN AND AGAIN: CONSEQUENTLY, INSTEAD OF FADING FROM CONSCIOUSNESS, INSTEAD OF BECOMING EASILY FORGOTTEN, IT MUST HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED ON THE CONSCIOUSNESS MORE AND MORE CLEARLY. HOW MUCH MORE REASONABLE IS THAT OPPOSING THEORY (IT IS NOT FOR THAT REASON MORE TRUE‚ÄÎ) WHICH HERBERT SPENCER,1 FOR EXAMPLE, ESPOUSED: THAT THE CONCEPT ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ IS ESSENTIALLY IDENTICAL WITH THE CONCEPT ‚ÄÚUSEFUL,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚPRACTICAL,‚ÄÙ SO THAT IN THE JUDGMENTS ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚBAD‚ÄÙ MANKIND HAS SUMMED UP AND SANCTIONED PRECISELY ITS UNFORGOTTEN AND UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCES REGARDING WHAT IS USEFUL-PRACTICAL AND WHAT IS HARMFUL-IMPRACTICAL. ACCORDING TO THIS THEORY, THAT WHICH HAS ALWAYS PROVED ITSELF USEFUL IS GOOD: THEREFORE IT MAY CLAIM TO BE ‚ÄÚVALUABLE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚVALUABLE IN ITSELF.‚ÄÙ THIS ROAD TO AN EXPLANATION IS, AS AFORESAID, ALSO A WRONG ONE, BUT AT LEAST THE EXPLANATION IS IN ITSELF REASONABLE AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY TENABLE.

THE SIGNPOST TO THE RIGHT ROAD WAS FOR ME THE QUESTION: WHAT WAS THE REAL ETYMOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DESIGNATIONS FOR ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ COINED IN THE VARIOUS LANGUAGES? I FOUND THEY ALL LED BACK TO THE SAME CONCEPTUAL TRANSFORMATION‚ÄÎTHAT EVERYWHERE ‚ÄÚNOBLE,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚARISTOCRATIC‚ÄÙ IN THE SOCIAL SENSE, IS THE BASIC CONCEPT FROM WHICH ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ IN THE SENSE OF ‚ÄÚWITH ARISTOCRATIC SOUL,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚNOBLE,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚWITH A SOUL OF A HIGH ORDER,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚWITH A PRIVILEGED SOUL‚ÄÙ NECESSARILY DEVELOPED: A DEVELOPMENT WHICH ALWAYS RUNS PARALLEL WITH THAT OTHER IN WHICH ‚ÄÚCOMMON,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚPLEBEIAN,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚLOW‚ÄÙ ARE FINALLY TRANSFORMED INTO THE CONCEPT ‚ÄÚBAD.‚ÄÙ THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THE LATTER IS THE GERMAN WORD SCHLECHT [BAD] ITSELF: WHICH IS IDENTICAL WITH SCHLICHT [PLAIN, SIMPLE]‚ÄÎCOMPARE SCHLECHTWEG [PLAINLY], SCHLECHTERDINGS [SIMPLY]‚ÄÎAND ORGINALLY DESIGNATED THE PLAIN, THE COMMON MAN, AS YET WITH NO INCULPATORY IMPLICATION AND SIMPLY IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO THE NOBILITY. ABOUT THE TIME OF THE THIRTY YEARS‚ÄÔ WAR, LATE ENOUGH THEREFORE, THIS MEANING CHANGED INTO THE ONE NOW CUSTOMARY.1

WITH REGARD TO A MORAL GENEALOGY THIS SEEMS TO ME A FUNDAMENTAL INSIGHT; THAT IT HAS BEEN ARRIVED AT SO LATE IS THE FAULT OF THE RETARDING INFLUENCE EXERCISED BY THE DEMOCRATIC PREJUDICE IN THE MODERN WORLD TOWARD ALL QUESTIONS OF ORIGIN. AND THIS IS SO EVEN IN THE APPARENTLY QUITE OBJECTIVE DOMAIN OF NATURAL SCIENCE AND PHYSIOLOGY, AS I SHALL MERELY HINT HERE. BUT WHAT MISCHIEF THIS PREJUDICE IS CAPABLE OF DOING, ESPECIALLY TO MORALITY AND HISTORY, ONCE IT HAS BEEN UNBRIDLED TO THE POINT OF HATRED IS SHOWN BY THE NOTORIOUS CASE OF BUCKLE;2 HERE THE PLEBEIANISM OF THE MODERN SPIRIT, WHICH IS OF ENGLISH ORIGIN, ERUPTED ONCE AGAIN ON ITS NATIVE SOIL, AS VIOLENTLY AS A MUD VOLCANO AND WITH THAT SALTY, NOISY, VULGAR ELOQUENCE WITH WHICH ALL VOLCANOS HAVE SPOKEN HITHERTO.‚ÄÎ

WITH REGARD TO OUR PROBLEM, WHICH MAY ON GOOD GROUNDS BE CALLED A QUIET PROBLEM AND ONE WHICH FASTIDIOUSLY DIRECTS ITSELF TO FEW EARS, IT IS OF NO SMALL INTEREST TO ASCERTAIN THAT THROUGH THOSE WORDS AND ROOTS WHICH DESIGNATE ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ THERE FREQUENTLY STILL SHINES THE MOST IMPORTANT NUANCE BY VIRTUE OF WHICH THE NOBLE FELT THEMSELVES TO BE MEN OF A HIGHER RANK. GRANTED THAT, IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES, THEY DESIGNATE THEMSELVES SIMPLY BY THEIR SUPERIORITY IN POWER (AS ‚ÄÚTHE POWERFUL,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚTHE MASTERS,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚTHE COMMANDERS‚ÄÙ) OR BY THE MOST CLEARLY VISIBLE SIGNS OF THIS SUPERIORITY, FOR EXAMPLE, AS ‚ÄÚTHE RICH,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚTHE POSSESSORS‚ÄÙ (THIS IS THE MEANING OF ARYA; AND OF CORRESPONDING WORDS IN IRANIAN AND SLAVIC). BUT THEY ALSO DO IT BY A TYPICAL CHARACTER TRAIT: AND THIS IS THE CASE THAT CONCERNS US HERE. THEY CALL THEMSELVES, FOR INSTANCE, ‚ÄÚTHE TRUTHFUL;‚ÄÙ THIS IS SO ABOVE ALL OF THE GREEK NOBILITY, WHOSE MOUTHPIECE IS THE MEGARIAN POET THEOGNIS.1 THE ROOT OF THE WORD COINED FOR THIS, ESTHLOS,2 SIGNIFIES ONE WHO IS, WHO POSSESSES REALITY, WHO IS ACTUAL, WHO IS TRUE; THEN, WITH A SUBJECTIVE TURN, THE TRUE AS THE TRUTHFUL: IN THIS PHASE OF CONCEPTUAL TRANSFORMATION IT BECOMES A SLOGAN AND CATCHWORD OF THE NOBILITY AND PASSES OVER ENTIRELY INTO THE SENSE OF ‚ÄÚNOBLE,‚ÄÙ AS DISTINCT FROM THE LYING COMMON MAN, WHICH IS WHAT THEOGNIS TAKES HIM TO BE AND HOW HE DESCRIBES HIM‚ÄÎUNTIL FINALLY, AFTER THE DECLINE OF THE NOBILITY, THE WORD IS LEFT TO DESIGNATE NOBILITY OF SOUL AND BECOMES AS IT WERE RIPE AND SWEET. IN THE WORD KAKOS,3 AS IN DEILOS4 (THE PLEBEIAN IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO THE AGA-THOS5), COWARDICE IS EMPHASIZED: THIS PERHAPS GIVES AN INDICATION IN WHICH DIRECTION ONE SHOULD SEEK THE ETYMOLOGICAL ORIGIN OF AGATHOS, WHICH IS SUSCEPTIBLE OF SEVERAL INTERPRETATIONS. THE LATIN MALUS6 (BESIDE WHICH I SET MELAS7) MAY DESIGNATE THE COMMON MAN AS THE DARK-COLORED, ABOVE ALL AS THE BLACK-HAIRED MAN (‚ÄÚHIC NIGER EST8‚ÄÎ‚ÄÙ), AS THE PRE-ARYAN OCCUPANT OF THE SOIL OF ITALY WHO WAS DISTINGUISHED MOST OBVIOUSLY FROM THE BLOND, THAT IS ARYAN, CONQUEROR RACE BY HIS COLOR; GAELIC, AT ANY RATE, OFFERS US A PRECISELY SIMILAR CASE‚ÄÎFIN (FOR EXAMPLE IN THE NAME FIN-GAL), THE DISTINGUISHING WORD FOR NOBILITY, FINALLY FOR THE GOOD, NOBLE, PURE, ORGINALLY MEANT THE BLOND-HEADED, IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO THE DARK, BLACK-HAIRED ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS.

THE CELTS, BY THE WAY, WERE DEFINITELY A BLOND RACE; IT IS WRONG TO ASSOCIATE TRACES OF AN ESSENTIALLY DARK-HAIRED PEOPLE WHICH APPEAR ON THE MORE CAREFUL ETHNOGRAPHICAL MAPS OF GERMANY WITH ANY SORT OF CELTIC ORIGIN OR BLOOD-MIXTURE, AS VIRCHOW9 STILL DOES: IT IS RATHER THE PRE-ARYAN PEOPLE OF GERMANY WHO EMERGE IN THESE PLACES. (THE SAME IS TRUE OF VIRTUALLY ALL EUROPE: THE SUPPRESSED RACE HAS GRADUALLY RECOVERED THE UPPER HAND AGAIN, IN COLORING, SHORTNESS OF SKULL, PERHAPS EVEN IN THE INTELLECTUAL AND SOCIAL INSTINCTS: STINCTS: WHO CAN SAY WHETHER MODERN DEMOCRACY, EVEN MORE MODERN ANARCHISM AND ESPECIALLY THAT INCLINATION FOR ‚ÄÚCOMMUNE‚ÄÙ FOR THE MOST PRIMITIVE FORM OF SOCIETY, WHICH IS NOW SHARED BY ALL THE SOCIALISTS OF EUROPE, DOES NOT SIGNIFY IN THE MAIN A TREMENDOUS COUNTERATTACK‚ÄÎAND THAT THE CONQUEROR AND MASTER RACE,10 THE ARYAN, IS NOT SUCCUMBING PHYSIOLOGICALLY, TOO?

I BELIEVE I MAY VENTURE TO INTERPRET THE LATIN BONUS11 AS ‚ÄÚTHE WARRIOR,‚ÄÙ PROVIDED I AM RIGHT IN TRACING BONUS BACK TO AN EARLIER DUONUS12 (COMPARE BELLUM = DUELLUM = DUEN-LUM, WHICH SEEMS TO ME TO CONTAIN DUONUS). THEREFORE BONUS AS THE MAN OF STRIFE, OF DISSENTION (DUO), AS THE MAN OF WAR: ONE SEES WHAT CONSTITUTED THE ‚ÄÚGOODNESS‚ÄÙ OF A MAN IN ANCIENT ROME. OUR GERMAN GUT [GOOD] EVEN: DOES IT NOT SIGNIFY ‚ÄÚTHE GODLIKE,‚ÄÙ THE MAN OF ‚ÄÚGODLIKE RACE‚ÄÙ? AND IS IT NOT IDENTICAL WITH THE POPULAR (ORIGINALLY NOBLE) NAME OF THE GOTHS? THE GROUNDS FOR THIS CONJECTURE CANNOT BE DEALT WITH HERE.‚ÄÎ

TO THIS RULE THAT A CONCEPT DENOTING POLITICAL SUPERIORITY ALWAYS RESOLVES ITSELF INTO A CONCEPT DENOTING SUPERIORITY OF SOUL IT IS NOT NECESSARILY AN EXCEPTION (ALTHOUGH IT PROVIDES OCCASIONS FOR EXCEPTIONS) WHEN THE HIGHEST CASTE IS AT THE SAME TIME THE PRIESTLY CASTE ARID THEREFORE EMPHASIZES IN ITS TOTAL DESCRIPTION OF ITSELF A PREDICATE THAT CALLS TO MIND ITS PRIESTLY FUNCTION. IT IS THEN, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT ‚ÄÚPURE‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚIMPURE‚ÄÙ CONFRONT ONE ANOTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME AS DESIGNATIONS OF STATION; AND HERE TOO THERE EVOLVES A ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ AND A ‚ÄÚBAD‚ÄÙ IN A SENSE NO LONGER REFERRING TO STATION. ONE SHOULD BE WARNED, MOREOVER, AGAINST TAKING THESE CONCEPTS ‚ÄÚPURE‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚIMPURE‚ÄÙ TOO PONDEROUSLY OR BROADLY, NOT TO SAY SYMBOLICALLY: ALL THE CONCEPTS OF ANCIENT MAN WERE RATHER AT FIRST INCREDIBLY UNCOUTH, COARSE, EXTERNAL, NARROW, STRAIGHTFORWARD, AND ALTOGETHER UNSYMBOLICAL IN MEANING TO A DEGREE THAT WE CAN SCARCELY CONCEIVE. THE ‚ÄÚPURE ONE‚ÄÙ IS FROM THE BEGINNING MERELY A MAN WHO WASHES HIMSELF, WHO FORBIDS HIMSELF CERTAIN FOODS THAT PRODUCE SKIN AILMENTS, WHO DOES NOT SLEEP WITH THE DIRTY WOMEN OF THE LOWER STRATA, WHO HAS AN AVERSION TO BLOOD‚ÄÎNO MORE, HARDLY MORE! ON THE OTHER HAND, TO BE SURE, IT IS CLEAR FROM THE WHOLE NATURE OF AN ESSENTIALLY PRIESTLY ARISTOCRACY WHY ANTITHETICAL VALUATIONS COULD IN PRECISELY THIS INSTANCE SOON BECOME DANGEROUSLY DEEPENED, SHARPENED, AND INTERNALIZED; AND INDEED THEY FINALLY TORE CHASMS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN THAT A VERY ACHILLES OF A FREE SPIRIT WOULD NOT VENTURE TO LEAP WITHOUT A SHUDDER. THERE IS FROM THE FIRST SOMETHING UNHEALTHY IN SUCH PRIESTLY ARISTOCRACIES AND IN THE HABITS RULING IN THEM WHICH TURN THEM AWAY FROM ACTION AND ALTERNATE BETWEEN BROODING AND EMOTIONAL EXPLOSIONS, HABITS WHICH SEEM TO HAVE AS THEIR ALMOST INVARIABLE CONSEQUENCE THAT INTESTINAL MORBIDITY AND NEURASTHENIA WHICH HAS AFFLICTED PRIESTS AT ALL TIMES; BUT AS TO THAT WHICH THEY THEMSELVES DEVISED AS A REMEDY FOR THIS MORBIDITY‚ÄÎMUST ONE NOT ASSERT THAT IT HAS ULTIMATELY PROVED ITSELF A HUNDRED TIMES MORE DANGEROUS IN ITS EFFECTS THAN THE SICKNESS IT WAS SUPPOSED TO CURE? MANKIND ITSELF IS STILL ILL WITH THE EFFECTS OF THIS PRIESTLY NA√ØVET√© IN MEDICINE! THINK, FOR EXAMPLE, OF CERTAIN FORMS OF DIET (ABSTINENCE FROM MEAT), OF FASTING, OF SEXUAL CONTINENCE, OF FLIGHT ‚ÄÚINTO THE WILDERNESS‚ÄÙ (THE WEIR MITCHELL ISOLATION CURE1‚ÄÎWITHOUT, TO BE SURE, THE SUBSEQUENT FATTENING AND OVERFEEDING WHICH CONSTITUTE THE MOST EFFECTIVE REMEDY FOR THE HYSTERIA INDUCED BY THE ASCETIC IDEAL): ADD TO THESE THE ENTIRE ANTISENSUALIS-TIC METAPHYSIC OF THE PRIESTS THAT MAKES MEN INDOLENT AND OVERRE-FINED, THEIR AUTOHYPNOSIS IN THE MANNER OF FAKIRS AND BRAHMINS‚ÄÎBRAHMA USED IN THE SHAPE OF A GLASS KNOB AND A FIXED IDEA‚ÄÎAND FINALLY THE ONLY-TOO-COMPREHENSIBLE SATIETY WITH ALL THIS, TOGETHER WITH THE RADICAL CURE FOR IT, NOTHINGNESS (OR GOD‚ÄÎTHE DESIRE FOR A UNIO MYSTICA WITH GOD IS THE DESIRE OF THE BUDDHIST FOR NOTHINGNESS, NIRVANA‚ÄÎAND NO MORE!). FOR WITH THE PRIESTS EVERYTHING BECOMES MORE DANGEROUS, NOT ONLY CURES AND REMEDIES, BUT ALSO ARROGANCE, REVENGE, ACUTENESS, PROFLIGACY, LOVE, LUST TO RULE, VIRTUE, DISEASE‚ÄÎBUT IT IS ONLY FAIR TO ADD THAT IT WAS ON THE SOIL OF THIS ESSENTIALLY DANGEROUS FORM OF HUMAN EXISTENCE, THE PRIESTLY FORM, THAT MAN FIRST BECAME AN INTERESTING ANIMAL, THAT ONLY HERE DID THE HUMAN SOUL IN A HIGHER SENSE ACQUIRE DEPTH AND BECOME EVIL‚ÄÎAND THESE ARE THE TWO BASIC RESPECTS IN WHICH MAN HAS HITHERTO BEEN SUPERIOR TO OTHER BEASTS!

ONE WILL HAVE DIVINED ALREADY HOW EASILY THE PRIESTLY MODE OF VALUATION CAN BRANCH OFF FROM THE KNIGHTLY-ARISTOCRATIC AND THEN DEVELOP INTO ITS OPPOSITE; THIS IS PARTICULARLY LIKELY WHEN THE PRIESTLY CASTE AND THE WARRIOR CASTE ARE IN JEALOUS OPPOSITION TO ONE ANOTHER AND ARE UNWILLING TO COME TO TERMS. THE KNIGHTLY-ARISTOCRATIC VALUE JUDGMENTS PRESUPPOSED A POWERFUL PHYSICALITY, A FLOURISHING, ABUNDANT, EVEN OVERFLOWING HEALTH, TOGETHER WITH THAT WHICH SERVES TO PRESERVE IT: WAR, ADVENTURE, HUNTING, DANCING, WAR GAMES, AND IN GENERAL ALL THAT INVOLVES VIGOROUS, FREE, JOYFUL ACTIVITY. THE PRIESTLY-NOBLE MODE OF VALUATION PRESUPPOSES, AS WE HAVE SEEN, OTHER THINGS: IT IS DISADVANTAGEOUS FOR IT WHEN IT COMES TO WAR! AS IS WELL KNOWN, THE PRIESTS ARE THE MOST EVIL ENEMIES‚ÄÎBUT WHY? BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST IMPOTENT. IT IS BECAUSE OF THEIR IMPOTENCE THAT IN THEM HATRED GROWS TO MONSTROUS AND UNCANNY PROPORTIONS, TO THE MOST SPIRITUAL AND POISONOUS KIND OF HATRED. THE TRULY GREAT HATERS IN WORLD HISTORY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PRIESTS; LIKEWISE THE MOST INGENIOUS1 HATERS: OTHER KINDS OF SPIRIT2 HARDLY COME INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN COMPARED WITH THE SPIRIT OF PRIESTLY VENGEFULNESS. HUMAN HISTORY WOULD BE ALTOGETHER TOO STUPID A THING WITHOUT THE SPIRIT THAT THE IMPOTENT HAVE INTRODUCED INTO IT‚ÄÎLET US TAKE AT ONCE THE MOST NOTABLE EXAMPLE. ALL THAT HAS BEEN DONE ON EARTH AGAINST ‚ÄÚTHE NOBLE,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚTHE POWERFUL,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚTHE MASTERS,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚTHE RULERS,‚ÄÙ FADES INTO NOTHING COMPARED WITH WHAT THE JEWS HAVE DONE AGAINST THEM; THE JEWS, THAT PRIESTLY PEOPLE, WHO IN OPPOSING THEIR ENEMIES AND CONQUERORS WERE ULTIMATELY SATISFIED WITH NOTHING LESS THAN A RADICAL REVALUATION OF THEIR ENEMIES‚ÄÔ VALUES, THAT IS TO SAY, AN ACT OF THE MOST SPIRITUAL REVENGE. FOR THIS ALONE WAS APPROPRIATE TO A PRIESTLY PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE EMBODYING THE MOST DEEPLY REPRESSED3 PRIESTLY VENGEFULNESS. IT WAS THE JEWS WHO, WITH AWE-INSPIRING CONSISTENCY, DARED TO INVERT THE ARISTOCRATIC VALUE-EQUATION (GOOD = NOBLE = POWERFUL = BEAUTIFUL = HAPPY = BELOVED OF GOD) AND TO HANG ON TO THIS INVERSION WITH THEIR TEETH, THE TEETH OF THE MOST ABYSMAL HATRED (THE HATRED OF IMPOTENCE), SAYING ‚ÄÚTHE WRETCHED ALONE ARE THE GOOD; THE POOR, IMPOTENT, LOWLY ALONE ARE THE GOOD; THE SUFFERING, DEPRIVED, SICK, UGLY ALONE ARE PIOUS, ALONE ARE BLESSED BY GOD, BLESSEDNESS IS FOR THEM ALONE‚ÄÎAND YOU, THE POWERFUL AND NOBLE, ARE ON THE CONTRARY THE EVIL, THE CRUEL, THE LUSTFUL, THE INSATIABLE, THE GODLESS TO ALL ETERNITY; AND YOU SHALL BE IN ALL ETERNITY THE UNBLESSED, ACCURSED, AND DAMNED!‚ÄÙ ‚Ä¶ONE KNOWS WHO INHERITED THIS JEWISH REVALUATION‚Ä¶IN CONNECTION WITH THE TREMENDOUS AND IMMEASURABLY FATEFUL INITIATIVE PROVIDED BY THE JEWS THROUGH THIS MOST FUNDAMENTAL OF ALL DECLARATIONS OF WAR, I RECALL THE PROPOSITION I ARRIVED AT ON A PREVIOUS OCCASION (BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, SECTION 195)4‚ÄÎTHAT WITH THE JEWS THERE BEGINS THE SLAVE REVOLT IN MORALITY: THAT REVOLT WHICH HAS A HISTORY OF TWO THOUSAND YEARS BEHIND IT AND WHICH WE NO LONGER SEE BECAUSE IT‚ÄÎHAS BEEN VICTORIOUS.

BUT YOU DO NOT COMPREHEND THIS? YOU ARE INCAPABLE OF SEEING SOMETHING THAT REQUIRED TWO THOUSAND YEARS TO ACHIEVE VICTORY?‚ÄÎTHERE IS NOTHING TO WONDER AT IN THAT: ALL PROTRACTED THINGS ARE HARD TO SEE, TO SEE WHOLE. THAT, HOWEVER, IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED: FROM THE TRUNK OF THAT TREE OF VENGEFULNESS AND HATRED, JEWISH HATRED‚ÄÎTHE PROFOUNDEST AND SUBLIMEST KIND OF HATRED, CAPABLE OF CREATING IDEALS AND REVERSING VALUES, THE LIKE OF WHICH HAS NEVER EXISTED ON EARTH BEFORE‚ÄÎTHERE GREW SOMETHING EQUALLY INCOMPARABLE, A NEW LOVE, THE PROFOUNDEST AND SUBLIMEST KIND OF LOVE‚ÄÎAND FROM WHAT OTHER TRUNK COULD IT HAVE GROWN?

ONE SHOULD NOT IMAGINE IT GREW UP AS THE DENIAL OF THAT THIRST FOR REVENGE, AS THE OPPOSITE OF JEWISH HATRED! NO, THE REVERSE IS TRUE! THAT LOVE GREW OUT OF IT AS ITS CROWN, AS ITS TRIUMPHANT CROWN SPREADING ITSELF FARTHER AND FARTHER INTO THE PUREST BRIGHTNESS AND SUNLIGHT, DRIVEN AS IT WERE INTO THE DOMAIN OF LIGHT AND THE HEIGHTS IN PURSUIT OF THE GOALS OF THAT HATRED‚ÄÎVICTORY, SPOIL, AND SEDUCTION‚ÄÎBY THE SAME IMPULSE THAT DROVE THE ROOTS OF THAT HATRED DEEPER AND DEEPER AND MORE AND MORE COVETOUSLY INTO ALL THAT WAS PROFOUND AND EVIL. THIS JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE INCARNATE GOSPEL OF LOVE, THIS ‚ÄÚREDEEMER‚ÄÙ WHO BROUGHT BLESSEDNESS AND VICTORY TO THE POOR, THE SICK, AND THE SINNERS‚ÄÎWAS HE NOT THIS SEDUCTION IN ITS MOST UNCANNY AND IRRESISTIBLE FORM, A SEDUCTION AND BYPATH TO PRECISELY THOSE JEWISH VALUES AND NEW IDEALS? DID ISRAEL NOT ATTAIN THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF ITS SUBLIME VENGEFULNESS PRECISELY THROUGH THE BYPATH OF THIS ‚ÄÚREDEEMER,‚ÄÙ THIS OSTENSIBLE OPPONENT AND DISINTEGRATOR OF ISRAEL? WAS IT NOT PART OF THE SECRET BLACK ART OF TRULY GRAND POLITICS OF REVENGE, OF A FARSEEING, SUBTERRANEAN, SLOWLY ADVANCING, AND PREMEDITATED REVENGE, THAT ISRAEL MUST ITSELF DENY THE REAL INSTRUMENT OF ITS REVENGE BEFORE ALL THE WORLD AS A MORTAL ENEMY AND NAIL IT TO THE CROSS, SO THAT ‚ÄÚALL THE WORLD,‚ÄÙ NAMELY ALL THE OPPONENTS OF ISRAEL, COULD UNHESITATINGLY SWALLOW JUST THIS BAIT? AND COULD SPIRITUAL SUBTLETY IMAGINE ANY MORE DANGEROUS BAIT THAN THIS? ANYTHING TO EQUAL THE ENTICING, INTOXICATING, OVERWHELMING, AND UNDERMINING POWER OF THAT SYMBOL OF THE ‚ÄÚHOLY CROSS,‚ÄÙ THAT GHASTLY PARADOX OF A ‚ÄÚGOD ON THE CROSS,‚ÄÙ THAT MYSTERY OF AN UNIMAGINABLE ULTIMATE CRUELTY AND SELF-CRUCIFIXION OF GOD FOR THE SALVATION OF MAN?

WHAT IS CERTAIN, AT LEAST, IS THAT SUB HOC SIGNO1 ISRAEL, WITH ITS VENGEFULNESS AND REVALUATION OF ALL VALUES, HAS HITHERTO TRIUMPHED AGAIN AND AGAIN OVER ALL OTHER IDEALS, OVER ALL NOBLER IDEALS.‚ÄÎ‚ÄÎ

‚ÄÚBUT WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT NOBLER IDEALS! LET US STICK TO THE FACTS: THE PEOPLE HAVE WON‚ÄÎOR ‚ÄÒTHE SLAVES‚ÄÔ OR ‚ÄÒTHE MOB‚ÄÔ OR ‚ÄÒTHE HERD‚ÄÔ OR WHATEVER YOU LIKE TO CALL THEM‚ÄÎIF THIS HAS HAPPENED THROUGH THE JEWS, VERY WELL! IN THAT CASE NO PEOPLE EVER HAD A MORE WORLD-HISTORIC MISSION. ‚ÄÒTHE MASTERS‚ÄÔ HAVE BEEN DISPOSED OF; THE MORALITY OF THE COMMON MAN HAS WON. ONE MAY CONCEIVE OF THIS VICTORY AS AT THE SAME TIME A BLOOD-POISONING (IT HAS MIXED THE RACES TOGETHER)‚ÄÎI SHAN‚ÄÔT CONTRADICT; BUT THIS IN-TOXICATION HAS UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN SUCCESSFUL. THE ‚ÄÒREDEMPTION‚ÄÔ OF THE HUMAN RACE (FROM ‚ÄÒTHE MASTERS,‚ÄÔ THAT IS) IS GOING FORWARD; EVERYTHING IS VISIBLY BECOMING JUDAIZED, CHRISTIANIZED, MOB-IZED (WHAT DO THE WORDS MATTER!). THE PROGRESS OF THIS POISON THROUGH THE ENTIRE BODY OF MANKIND SEEMS IRRESISTIBLE, ITS PACE AND TEMPO MAY FROM NOW ON EVEN GROW SLOWER, SUBTLER, LESS AUDIBLE, MORE CAUTIOUS‚ÄÎTHERE IS PLENTY OF TIME.‚ÄÎTO THIS END, DOES THE CHURCH TODAY STILL HAVE ANY NECESSARY ROLE TO PLAY? DOES IT STILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXIST? OR COULD ONE DO WITHOUT IT? QUAERITUR.2 IT SEEMS TO HINDER RATHER THAN HASTEN THIS PROGRESS. BUT PERHAPS THAT IS ITS USEFULNESS.‚ÄÎCERTAINLY IT HAS, OVER THE YEARS, BECOME SOMETHING CRUDE AND BOORISH, SOMETHING REPELLENT TO A MORE DELICATE INTELLECT, TO A TRULY MODERN TASTE. OUGHT IT NOT TO BECOME AT LEAST A LITTLE MORE REFINED?‚ÄÎTODAY IT ALIENATES RATHER THAN SEDUCES.‚ÄÎWHICH OF US WOULD BE A FREE SPIRIT IF THE CHURCH DID NOT EXIST? IT IS THE CHURCH, AND NOT ITS POISON, THAT REPELS US.‚ÄÎAPART FROM THE CHURCH, WE, TOO, LOVE THE POISON.‚ÄÎ‚ÄÙ

THIS IS THE EPILOGUE OF A ‚ÄÚFREE SPIRIT‚ÄÙ TO MY SPEECH; AN HONEST ANIMAL, AS HE HAS ABUNDANTLY REVEALED, AND A DEMOCRAT, MOREOVER; HE HAD BEEN LISTENING TO ME TILL THEN AND COULD NOT ENDURE TO LISTEN TO MY SILENCE. FOR AT THIS POINT I HAVE MUCH TO BE SILENT ABOUT.

THE SLAVE REVOLT IN MORALITY BEGINS WHEN RESSENTIMENT1 ITSELF BECOMES CREATIVE AND GIVES BIRTH TO VALUES: THE RESSENTIMENT OF NATURES THAT ARE DENIED THE TRUE REACTION, THAT OF DEEDS, AND COMPENSATE THEMSELVES WITH AN IMAGINARY REVENGE. WHILE EVERY NOBLE MORALITY DEVELOPS FROM A TRIUMPHANT AFFIRMATION OF ITSELF, SLAVE MORALITY FROM THE OUTSET SAYS NO TO WHAT IS ‚ÄÚOUTSIDE,‚ÄÙ WHAT IS ‚ÄÚDIFFERENT,‚ÄÙ WHAT IS ‚ÄÚNOT ITSELF;‚ÄÙ AND THIS NO IS ITS CREATIVE DEED. THIS INVERSION OF THE VALUE-POSITING EYE‚ÄÎTHIS NEED TO DIRECT ONE‚ÄÔS VIEW OUTWARD INSTEAD OF BACK TO ONESELF‚ÄÎIS OF THE ESSENCE OF RESSENTIMENT: IN ORDER TO EXIST, SLAVE MORALITY ALWAYS FIRST NEEDS A HOSTILE EXTERNAL WORLD; IT NEEDS, PHYSIOLOGICALLY SPEAKING, EXTERNAL STIMULI IN ORDER TO ACT AT ALL‚ÄÎITS ACTION IS FUNDAMENTALLY REACTION.

THE REVERSE IS THE CASE WITH THE NOBLE MODE OF VALUATION: IT ACTS AND GROWS SPONTANEOUSLY, IT SEEKS ITS OPPOSITE ONLY SO AS TO AFFIRM ITSELF MORE GRATEFULLY AND TRIUMPHANTLY‚ÄÎITS NEGATIVE CONCEPT ‚ÄÚLOW,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚCOMMON,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚBAD‚ÄÙ IS ONLY A SUBSEQUENTLY-INVENTED PALE, CONTRASTING IMAGE IN RELATION TO ITS POSITIVE BASIC CONCEPT‚ÄÎFILLED WITH LIFE AND PASSION THROUGH AND THROUGH‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚWE NOBLE ONES, WE GOOD, BEAUTIFUL, HAPPY ONES!‚ÄÙ WHEN THE NOBLE MODE OF VALUATION BLUNDERS AND SINS AGAINST REALITY, IT DOES SO IN RESPECT TO THE SPHERE WITH WHICH IT IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY FAMILIAR, AGAINST A REAL KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH IT HAS INDEED INFLEXIBLY GUARDED ITSELF: IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES IT MISUNDERSTANDS THE SPHERE IT DESPISES, THAT OF THE COMMON MAN, OF THE LOWER ORDERS; ON THE OTHER HAND, ONE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT, EVEN SUPPOSING THAT THE AFFECT OF CONTEMPT, OF LOOKING DOWN FROM A SUPERIOR HEIGHT, FALSIFIES THE IMAGE OF THAT WHICH IT DESPISES, IT WILL AT ANY RATE STILL BE A MUCH LESS SERIOUS FALSIFICATION THAN THAT PERPETRATED ON ITS OPPONENT‚ÄÎIN EFFIGIE OF COURSE‚ÄÎBY THE SUBMERGED HATRED, THE VENGEFULNESS OF THE IMPOTENT. THERE IS INDEED TOO MUCH CARELESSNESS, TOO MUCH TAKING LIGHTLY, TOO MUCH LOOKING AWAY AND IMPATIENCE INVOLVED IN CONTEMPT, EVEN TOO MUCH JOYFULNESS, FOR IT TO BE ABLE TO TRANSFORM ITS OBJECT INTO A REAL CARICATURE AND MONSTER.

ONE SHOULD NOT OVERLOOK THE ALMOST BENEVOLENT NUANCES THAT THE GREEK NOBILITY, FOR EXAMPLE, BESTOWS ON ALL THE WORDS IT EMPLOYS TO DISTINGUISH THE LOWER ORDERS FROM ITSELF; HOW THEY ARE CONTINUOUSLY MINGLED AND SWEETENED WITH A KIND OF PITY, CONSIDERATION, AND FORBEARANCE, SO THAT FINALLY ALMOST ALL THE WORDS REFERRING TO THE COMMON MAN HAVE REMAINED AS EXPRESSIONS SIGNIFYING ‚ÄÚUNHAPPY,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚPITIABLE‚ÄÙ (COMPARE DEILOS,2 DEILAIOS,3 PONƑÌROS4 MOCHTHƑÌROS,5 THE LAST TWO OF WHICH PROPERLY DESIGNATE THE COMMON MAN AS WORK-SLAVE AND BEAST OF BURDEN)‚ÄÎAND HOW ON THE OTHER HAND ‚ÄÚBAD,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚLOW,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚUNHAPPY‚ÄÙ HAVE NEVER CEASED TO SOUND TO THE GREEK EAR AS ONE NOTE WITH A TONE-COLOR IN WHICH ‚ÄÚUNHAPPY‚ÄÙ PREPONDERATES: THIS AS AN INHERITANCE FROM THE ANCIENT NOBLER ARISTOCRATIC MODE OF EVALUATION, WHICH DOES NOT BELIE ITSELF EVEN IN ITS CONTEMPT (‚ÄÎPHILOLOGISTS SHOULD RECALL THE SENSE IN WHICH O√ØZYROS,6 ANOLBOS,7 TLƑÌMƑÌN,8 DYSTYCHEIN9 XYMPHORA10 ARE EMPLOYED). THE ‚ÄÚWELL-BORN‚ÄÙ FELT THEMSELVES TO BE THE ‚ÄÚHAPPY;‚ÄÙ THEY DID NOT HAVE TO ESTABLISH THEIR HAPPINESS ARTIFICIALLY BY EXAMINING THEIR ENEMIES, OR TO PERSUADE THEMSELVES, DECEIVE THEMSELVES, THAT THEY WERE HAPPY (AS ALL MEN OF RESSENTIMENT ARE IN THE HABIT OF DOING); AND THEY LIKEWISE KNEW, AS ROUNDED MEN REPLETE WITH ENERGY AND THEREFORE NECESSARILY ACTIVE, THAT HAPPINESS SHOULD NOT BE SUNDERED FROM ACTION‚ÄÎBEING ACTIVE WAS WITH THEM NECESSARILY A PART OF HAPPINESS (WHENCE EU PRATTEIN11 TAKES ITS ORIGIN)‚ÄÎALL VERY MUCH THE OPPOSITE OF ‚ÄÚHAPPINESS‚ÄÙ AT THE LEVEL OF THE IMPOTENT, THE OPPRESSED, AND THOSE IN WHOM POISONOUS AND INIMICAL FEELINGS ARE FESTERING, WITH WHOM IT APPEARS AS ESSENTIALLY NARCOTIC, DRUG, REST, PEACE, ‚ÄÚSABBATH,‚ÄÙ SLACKENING OF TENSION AND RELAXING OF LIMBS, IN SHORT PASSIVELY.

WHILE THE NOBLE MAN LIVES IN TRUST AND OPENNESS WITH HIMSELF (GENNAIOS12 ‚ÄÚOF NOBLE DESCENT‚ÄÙ UNDERLINES THE NUANCE ‚ÄÚUPRIGHT‚ÄÙ AND PROBABLY ALSO ‚ÄÚNA√ØVE‚ÄÙ), THE MAN OF RESSENTIMENT IS NEITHER UPRIGHT NOR NA√ØVE NOR HONEST AND STRAIGHTFORWARD WITH HIMSELF. HIS SOUL SQUINTS; HIS SPIRIT LOVES HIDING PLACES, SECRET PATHS AND BACK DOORS, EVERYTHING COVERT ENTICES HIM AS HIS WORLD, HIS SECURITY, HIS REFRESHMENT; HE UNDERSTANDS HOW TO KEEP SILENT, HOW NOT TO FORGET, HOW TO WAIT, HOW TO BE PROVISIONALLY SELF-DEPRECATING AND HUMBLE. A RACE OF SUCH MEN OF RESSENTIMENT IS BOUND TO BECOME EVENTUALLY CLEVERER THAN ANY NOBLE RACE; IT WILL ALSO HONOR CLEVERNESS TO A FAR GREATER DEGREE: NAMELY, AS A CONDITION OF EXISTENCE OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE; WHILE WITH NOBLE MEN CLEVERNESS CAN EASILY ACQUIRE A SUBTLE FLAVOR OF LUXURY AND SUBTLETY‚ÄÎFOR HERE IT IS FAR LESS ESSENTIAL THAN THE PERFECT FUNCTIONING OF THE REGULATING UNCONSCIOUS INSTINCTS OR EVEN THAN A CERTAIN IMPRUDENCE, PERHAPS A BOLD RECKLESSNESS WHETHER IN THE FACE OF DANGER OR OF THE ENEMY, OR THAT ENTHUSIASTIC IMPULSIVENESS IN ANGER, LOVE, REVERENCE, GRATITUDE, AND REVENGE BY WHICH NOBLE SOULS HAVE AT ALL TIMES RECOGNIZED ONE ANOTHER. RESSENTIMENT ITSELF, IF IT SHOULD APPEAR IN THE NOBLE MAN, CONSUMMATES AND EXHAUSTS ITSELF IN AN IMMEDIATE REACTION, AND THEREFORE DOES NOT POISON: ON THE OTHER HAND, IT FAILS TO APPEAR AT ALL ON COUNTLESS OCCASIONS ON WHICH IT INEVITABLY APPEARS IN THE WEAK AND IMPOTENT.

TO BE INCAPABLE OF TAKING ONE‚ÄÔS ENEMIES, ONE‚ÄÔS ACCIDENTS, EVEN ONE‚ÄÔS MISDEEDS SERIOUSLY FOR VERY LONG‚ÄÎTHAT IS THE SIGN OF STRONG, FULL NATURES IN WHOM THERE IS AN EXCESS OF THE POWER TO FORM, TO MOLD, TO RECUPERATE AND TO FORGET (A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IN MODERN TIMES IS MIRABEAU,13 WHO HAD NO MEMORY FOR INSULTS AND VILE ACTIONS DONE HIM AND WAS UNABLE TO FORGIVE SIMPLY BECAUSE HE‚ÄÎFORGOT). SUCH A MAN SHAKES OFF WITH A SINGLE SHRUG MANY VERMIN THAT EAT DEEP INTO OTHERS; HERE ALONE GENUINE ‚ÄÚLOVE OF ONE‚ÄÔS ENEMIES‚ÄÙ IS POSSIBLE‚ÄÎSUPPOSING IT TO BE POSSIBLE AT ALL ON EARTH. HOW MUCH REVERENCE HAS A NOBLE MAN FOR HIS ENEMIES!‚ÄÎAND SUCH REVERENCE IS A BRIDGE TO LOVE.‚ÄÎFOR HE DESIRES HIS ENEMY FOR HIMSELF, AS HIS MARK OF DISTINCTION; HE CAN ENDURE NO OTHER ENEMY THAN ONE IN WHOM THERE IS NOTHING TO DESPISE AND VERY MUCH TO HONOR! IN CONTRAST TO THIS, PICTURE ‚ÄÚTHE ENEMY‚ÄÙ AS THE MAN OF RESSENTIMENT CONCEIVES HIM‚ÄÎAND HERE PRECISELY IS HIS DEED, HIS CREATION: HE HAS CONCEIVED ‚ÄÚTHE EVIL ENEMY,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚTHE EVIL ONE,‚ÄÙ AND THIS IN FACT IS HIS BASIC CONCEPT, FROM WHICH HE THEN EVOLVES, AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT AND PENDANT, A ‚ÄÚGOOD ONE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHIMSELF!





11


THIS, THEN, IS QUITE THE CONTRARY OF WHAT THE NOBLE MAN DOES, WHO CONCEIVES THE BASIC CONCEPT ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ IN ADVANCE AND SPONTANEOUSLY OUT OF HIMSELF AND ONLY THEN CREATES FOR HIMSELF AN IDEA OF ‚ÄÚBAD‚ÄÙ! THIS ‚ÄÚBAD‚ÄÙ OF NOBLE ORIGIN AND THAT ‚ÄÚEVIL‚ÄÙ OUT OF THE CAULDRON OF UNSATISFIED HATRED‚ÄÎTHE FORMER AN AFTER-PRODUCTION, A SIDE ISSUE, A CONTRASTING SHADE, THE LATTER ON THE CONTRARY THE ORIGINAL THING, THE BEGINNING, THE DISTINCTIVE DEED IN THE CONCEPTION OF A SLAVE MORALITY‚ÄÎHOW DIFFERENT THESE WORDS ‚ÄÚBAD‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚEVIL‚ÄÙ ARE, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE BOTH APPARENTLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE SAME CONCEPT ‚ÄÚGOOD.‚ÄÙ BUT IT IS NOT THE SAME CONCEPT ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ: ONE SHOULD ASK RATHER PRECISELY WHO IS ‚ÄÚEVIL‚ÄÙ IN THE SENSE OF THE MORALITY OF RES-SENTIMENT. THE ANSWER, IN ALL STRICTNESS, IS: PRECISELY THE ‚ÄÚGOOD MAN‚ÄÙ OF THE OTHER MORALITY, PRECISELY THE NOBLE, POWERFUL MAN, THE RULER, BUT DYED IN ANOTHER COLOR, INTERPRETED IN ANOTHER FASHION, SEEN IN ANOTHER WAY BY THE VENOMOUS EYE OF RESSENTIMENT.

HERE THERE IS ONE THING WE SHALL BE THE LAST TO DENY: HE WHO KNOWS THESE ‚ÄÚGOOD MEN‚ÄÙ ONLY AS ENEMIES KNOWS ONLY EVIL ENEMIES, AND THE SAME MEN WHO ARE HELD SO STERNLY IN CHECK INTER PARES1 BY CUSTOM, RESPECT, USAGE, GRATITUDE, AND EVEN MORE BY MUTUAL SUSPICION AND JEALOUSY, AND WHO ON THE OTHER HAND IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH ONE ANOTHER SHOW THEMSELVES SO RESOURCEFUL IN CONSIDERATION, SELF-CONTROL DELICACY, LOYALTY, PRIDE, AND FRIENDSHIP‚ÄÎONCE THEY GO OUTSIDE, WHERE THE STRANGE, THE STRANGER IS FOUND, THEY ARE NOT MUCH BETTER THAN UNCAGED BEASTS OF PREY. THERE THEY SAVOR A FREEDOM FROM ALL SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS, THEY COMPENSATE THEMSELVES IN THE WILDERNESS FOR THE TENSION ENGENDERED BY PROTRACTED CONFINEMENT AND ENCLOSURE WITHIN THE PEACE OF SOCIETY, THEY GO BACK TO THE INNOCENT CONSCIENCE OF THE BEAST OF PREY, AS TRIUMPHANT MONSTERS WHO PERHAPS EMERGE FROM A DISGUSTING2 PROCESSION OF MURDER, ARSON, RAPE, AND TORTURE, EXHILARATED AND UNDISTURBED OF SOUL, AS IF IT WERE NO MORE THAN A STUDENTS‚ÄÔ PRANK, CONVINCED THEY HAVE PROVIDED THE POETS WITH A LOT MORE MATERIAL FOR SONG AND PRAISE. ONE CANNOT FAIL TO SEE AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL THESE NOBLE RACES THE BEAST OF PREY, THE SPLENDID BLOND BEAST3 PROWLING ABOUT AVIDLY IN SEARCH OF SPOIL AND VICTORY; THIS HIDDEN CORE NEEDS TO ERUPT FROM TIME TO TIME, THE ANIMAL HAS TO GET OUT AGAIN AND GO BACK TO THE WILDERNESS: THE ROMAN, ARABIAN, GERMANIC, JAPANESE NOBILITY, THE HOMERIC HEROES, THE SCANDINAVIAN VIKINGS‚ÄÎTHEY ALL SHARED THIS NEED.

IT IS THE NOBLE RACES THAT HAVE LEFT BEHIND THEM THE CONCEPT ‚ÄÚBARBARIAN‚ÄÙ WHEREVER THEY HAVE GONE; EVEN THEIR HIGHEST CULTURE BETRAYS A CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT AND EVEN A PRIDE IN IT (FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN PERICLES SAYS TO HIS ATHENIANS IN HIS FAMOUS FUNERAL ORATION ‚ÄÚOUR BOLDNESS HAS GAINED ACCESS TO EVERY LAND AND SEA, EVERYWHERE RAISING IMPERISHABLE MONUMENTS TO ITS GOODNESS AND WICKEDNESS‚ÄÙ). THIS ‚ÄÚBOLDNESS‚ÄÙ OF NOBLE RACES, MAD, ABSURD, AND SUDDEN IN ITS EXPRESSION, THE INCALCULABLY, EVEN INCREDIBILITY OF THEIR UNDERTAKINGS‚ÄÎPERICLES SPECIALLY COMMENDS THE RHATHYMIA4 OF THE ATHENIANS‚ÄÎTHEIR INDIFFERENCE TO AND CONTEMPT FOR SECURITY, BODY, LIFE, COMFORT, THEIR HAIR-RAISING5 CHEERFULNESS AND PROFOUND JOY IN ALL DESTRUCTION, IN ALL THE VOLUPTUOUSNESS OF VICTORY AND CRUELTY‚ÄÎALL THIS CAME TOGETHER, IN THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO SUFFERED FROM IT, IN THE IMAGE OF THE ‚ÄÚBARBARIAN,‚ÄÙ THE ‚ÄÚEVIL ENEMY,‚ÄÙ PERHAPS AS THE ‚ÄÚGOTHS,‚ÄÙ THE ‚ÄÚVANDALS.‚ÄÙ THE DEEP AND ICY MISTRUST THE GERMAN STILL AROUSES TODAY WHENEVER HE GETS INTO A POSITION OF POWER IS AN ECHO OF THAT INEXTINGUISHABLE HORROR WITH WHICH EUROPE OBSERVED FOR CENTURIES THAT RAGING OF THE BLOND GERMANIC BEAST (ALTHOUGH BETWEEN THE OLD GERMANIC TRIBES AND US GERMANS THERE EXISTS HARDLY A CONCEPTUAL RELATIONSHIP, LET ALONE ONE OF BLOOD).

I ONCE DREW ATTENTION TO THE DILEMMA IN WHICH HESIOD FOUND HIMSELF WHEN HE CONCOCTED HIS SUCCESSION OF CULTURAL EPOCHS AND SOUGHT TO EXPRESS THEM IN TERMS OF GOLD, SILVER, AND BRONZE: HE KNEW NO WAY OF HANDLING THE CONTRADICTION PRESENTED BY THE GLORIOUS BUT AT THE SAME TIME TERRIBLE AND VIOLENT WORLD OF HOMER EXCEPT BY DIVIDING ONE EPOCH INTO TWO EPOCHS, WHICH HE THEN PLACED ONE BEHIND THE OTHER‚ÄÎFIRST THE EPOCH OF THE HEROES AND DEMIGODS OF TROY AND THEBES, THE FORM IN WHICH THAT WORLD HAD SURVIVED IN THE MEMORY OF THE NOBLE RACES WHO WERE THOSE HEROES‚ÄÔ TRUE DESCENDANTS; THEN THE BRONZE EPOCH, THE FORM IN WHICH THAT SAME WORLD APPEARED TO THE DESCENDANTS OF THE DOWNTRODDEN, PILLAGED, MISTREATED, ABDUCTED, ENSLAVED: AN EPOCH OF BRONZE, AS AFORESAID, HARD, COLD, CRUEL, DEVOID OF FEELING OR CONSCIENCE, DESTRUCTIVE AND BLOODY.

SUPPOSING THAT WHAT IS AT ANY RATE BELIEVED TO BE THE ‚ÄÚTRUTH‚ÄÙ REALLY IS TRUE, AND THE MEANING OF ALL CULTURE IS THE REDUCTION OF THE BEAST OF PREY ‚ÄÚMAN‚ÄÙ TO A TAME AND CIVILIZED ANIMAL, A DOMESTIC ANIMAL, THEN ONE WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE TO REGARD ALL THOSE INSTINCTS OF REACTION AND RESSENTIMENT THROUGH WHOSE AID THE NOBLE RACES AND THEIR IDEALS WERE FINALLY CONFOUNDED AND OVERTHROWN AS THE ACTUAL INSTRUMENTS OF CULTURE; WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE BEARERS OF THESE INSTINCTS THEMSELVES REPRESENT CULTURE. RATHER IS THE REVERSE NOT MERELY PROBABLE‚ÄÎNO! TODAY IT IS PALPABLE! THESE BEARERS OF THE OPPRESSIVE INSTINCTS THAT THIRST FOR REPRISAL, THE DESCENDANTS OF EVERY KIND OF EUROPEAN AND NON-EUROPEAN SLAVERY, AND ESPECIALLY OF THE ENTIRE PRE-ARYAN POPULACE‚ÄÎTHEY REPRESENT THE REGRESSION OF MANKIND! THESE ‚ÄÚINSTRUMENTS OF CULTURE‚ÄÙ ARE A DISGRACE TO MAN AND RATHER AN ACCUSATION AND COUNTERARGUMENT AGAINST ‚ÄÚCULTURE‚ÄÙ IN GENERAL! ONE MAY BE QUITE JUSTIFIED IN CONTINUING TO FEAR THE BLOND BEAST AT THE CORE OF ALL NOBLE RACES AND IN BEING ON ONE‚ÄÔS GUARD AGAINST IT: BUT WHO WOULD NOT A HUNDRED TIMES SOONER FEAR WHERE ONE CAN ALSO ADMIRE THAN NOT FEAR BUT BE PERMANENTLY CONDEMNED TO THE REPELLENT SIGHT OF THE ILL-CONSTITUTED, DWARFED, ATROPHIED, AND POISONED?6 AND IS THAT NOT OUR FATE? WHAT TODAY CONSTITUTES OUR ANTIPATHY TO ‚ÄÚMAN‚ÄÙ?‚ÄÎFOR WE SUFFER FROM MAN, BEYOND DOUBT.

NOT FEAR; RATHER THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE ANYTHING LEFT TO FEAR IN MAN; THAT THE MAGGOT7 ‚ÄÚMAN‚ÄÙ IS SWARMING IN THE FOREGROUND; THAT THE ‚ÄÚTAME MAN,‚ÄÙ THE HOPELESSLY MEDIOCRE AND INSIPID8 MAN, HAS ALREADY LEARNED TO FEEL HIMSELF AS THE GOAL AND ZENITH, AS THE MEANING OF HISTORY, AS ‚ÄÚHIGHER MAN‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT HE HAS INDEED A CERTAIN RIGHT TO FEEL THUS, INSOFAR AS HE FEELS HIMSELF ELEVATED ABOVE THE SURFEIT OF ILL-CONSTITUTED, SICKLY, WEARY AND EXHAUSTED PEOPLE OF WHICH EUROPE IS BEGINNING TO STINK TODAY, AS SOMETHING AT LEAST RELATIVELY WELL-CONSTITUTED, AT LEAST STILL CAPABLE OF LIVING, AT LEAST AFFIRMING LIFE.





12


AT THIS POINT I CANNOT SUPPRESS A SIGH AND A LAST HOPE. WHAT IS IT THAT I ESPECIALLY FIND UTTERLY UNENDURABLE? THAT I CANNOT COPE WITH, THAT MAKES ME CHOKE AND FAINT? BAD AIR! BAD AIR! THE APPROACH OF SOME ILL-CONSTITUTED THING; THAT I HAVE TO SMELL THE ENTRAILS OF SOME ILL-CONSTITUTED SOUL!

HOW MUCH ONE IS ABLE TO ENDURE: DISTRESS, WANT, BAD WEATHER, SICKNESS, TOIL, SOLITUDE. FUNDAMENTALLY ONE CAN COPE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE, BORN AS ONE IS TO A SUBTERRANEAN LIFE OF STRUGGLE; ONE EMERGES AGAIN AND AGAIN INTO THE LIGHT, ONE EXPERIENCES AGAIN AND AGAIN ONE‚ÄÔS GOLDEN HOUR OF VICTORY‚ÄÎAND THEN ONE STANDS FORTH AS ONE WAS BORN, UNBREAKABLE, TENSED, READY FOR NEW, EVEN HARDER, REMOTER THINGS, LIKE A BOW THAT DISTRESS ONLY SERVES TO DRAW TAUTER.

BUT GRANT ME FROM TIME TO TIME‚ÄÎIF THERE ARE DIVINE GODDESSES IN THE REALM BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL‚ÄÎGRANT ME THE SIGHT, BUT ONE GLANCE OF SOMETHING PERFECT, WHOLLY ACHIEVED, HAPPY, MIGHTY, TRIUMPHANT, SOMETHING STILL CAPABLE OF AROUSING FEAR! OF A MAN WHO JUSTIFIES MAN, OF A COMPLEMENTARY AND REDEEMING LUCKY HIT ON THE PART OF MAN FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH ONE MAY STILL BELIEVE IN MAN!

FOR THIS IS HOW THINGS ARE: THE DIMINUTION AND LEVELING OF EUROPEAN MAN CONSTITUTES OUR GREATEST DANGER, FOR THE SIGHT OF HIM MAKES US WEARY.‚ÄÎWE CAN SEE NOTHING TODAY THAT WANTS TO GROW GREATER, WE SUSPECT THAT THINGS WILL CONTINUE TO GO DOWN, DOWN, TO BECOME THINNER, MORE GOOD-NATURED, MORE PRUDENT, MORE COMFORTABLE, MORE MEDIOCRE, MORE INDIFFERENT, MORE CHINESE, MORE CHRISTIAN‚ÄÎTHERE IS NO DOUBT THAT MAN IS GETTING ‚ÄÚBETTER‚ÄÙ ALL THE TIME.

HERE PRECISELY IS WHAT HAS BECOME A FATALITY FOR EUROPE‚ÄÎTOGETHER WITH THE FEAR OF MAN WE HAVE ALSO LOST OUR LOVE OF HIM, OUR REVERENCE FOR HIM, OUR HOPES FOR HIM, EVEN THE WILL TO HIM. THE SIGHT OF MAN NOW MAKES US WEARY‚ÄÎWHAT IS NIHILISM TODAY IF IT IS NOT THAT?‚ÄÎWE ARE WEARY OF MAN.





13


BUT LET US RETURN: THE PROBLEM OF THE OTHER ORIGIN OF THE ‚ÄÚGOOD,‚ÄÙ OF THE GOOD AS CONCEIVED BY THE MAN OF RESSENTIMENT, DEMANDS ITS SOLUTION.

THAT LAMBS DISLIKE GREAT BIRDS OF PREY DOES NOT SEEM STRANGE: ONLY IT GIVES NO GROUND FOR REPROACHING THESE BIRDS OF PREY FOR BEARING OFF LITTLE LAMBS. AND IF THE LAMBS SAY AMONG THEMSELVES: ‚ÄÚTHESE BIRDS OF PREY ARE EVIL; AND WHOEVER IS LEAST LIKE A BIRD OF PREY, BUT RATHER ITS OPPOSITE, A LAMB‚ÄÎWOULD HE NOT BE GOOD?‚ÄÙ THERE IS NO REASON TO FIND FAULT WITH THIS INSTITUTION OF AN IDEAL, EXCEPT PERHAPS THAT THE BIRDS OF PREY MIGHT VIEW IT A LITTLE IRONICALLY AND SAY: ‚ÄÚWE DON‚ÄÔT DISLIKE THEM AT ALL, THESE GOOD LITTLE LAMBS; WE EVEN LOVE THEM: NOTHING IS MORE TASTY THAN A TENDER LAMB.‚ÄÙ

TO DEMAND OF STRENGTH THAT IT SHOULD NOT EXPRESS ITSELF AS STRENGTH, THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE A DESIRE TO OVERCOME, A DESIRE TO THROW DOWN, A DESIRE TO BECOME MASTER, A THIRST FOR ENEMIES AND RESISTANCES AND TRIUMPHS, IS JUST AS ABSURD AS TO DEMAND OF WEAKNESS THAT IT SHOULD EXPRESS ITSELF AS STRENGTH. A QUANTUM OF FORCE IS EQUIVALENT TO A QUANTUM OF DRIVE, WILL, EFFECT‚ÄÎMORE, IT IS NOTHING OTHER THAN PRECISELY THIS VERY DRIVING, WILLING, EFFECTING, AND ONLY OWING TO THE SEDUCTION OF LANGUAGE (AND OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ERRORS OF REASON THAT ARE PETRIFIED IN IT) WHICH CONCEIVES AND MISCONCEIVES ALL EFFECTS AS CONDITIONED BY SOMETHING THAT CAUSES EFFECTS, BY A ‚ÄÚSUBJECT,‚ÄÙ CAN IT APPEAR OTHERWISE. FOR JUST AS THE POPULAR MIND SEPARATES THE LIGHTNING FROM ITS FLASH AND TAKES THE LATTER FOR AN ACTION, FOR THE OPERATION OF A SUBJECT CALLED LIGHTNING, SO POPULAR MORALITY ALSO SEPARATES STRENGTH FROM EXPRESSIONS OF STRENGTH, AS IF THERE WERE A NEUTRAL SUBSTRATUM BEHIND THE STRONG MAN, WHICH WAS FREE TO EXPRESS STRENGTH OR NOT TO DO SO. BUT THERE IS NO SUCH SUBSTRATUM; THERE IS NO ‚ÄÚBEING‚ÄÙ BEHIND DOING, EFFECTING, BECOMING; ‚ÄÚTHE DOER‚ÄÙ IS MERELY A FICTION ADDED TO THE DEED‚ÄÎTHE DEED IS EVERYTHING. THE POPULAR MIND IN FACT DOUBLES THE DEED; WHEN IT SEES THE LIGHTNING FLASH, IT IS THE DEED OF A DEED: IT POSITS THE SAME EVENT FIRST AS CAUSE AND THEN A SECOND TIME AS ITS EFFECT. SCIENTISTS DO NO BETTER WHEN THEY SAY ‚ÄÚFORCE MOVES,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚFORCE CAUSES,‚ÄÙ AND THE LIKE‚ÄÎALL ITS COOLNESS, ITS FREEDOM FROM EMOTION NOTWITHSTANDING, OUR ENTIRE SCIENCE STILL LIES UNDER THE MISLEADING INFLUENCE OF LANGUAGE AND HAS NOT DISPOSED OF THAT LITTLE CHANGELING, THE ‚ÄÚSUBJECT‚ÄÙ (THE ATOM, FOR EXAMPLE, IS SUCH A CHANGELING, AS IS THE KANTIAN ‚ÄÚTHING-IN-ITSELF‚ÄÙ); NO WONDER IF THE SUBMERGED, DARKLY GLOWERING EMOTIONS OF VENGEFULNESS AND HATRED EXPLOIT THIS BELIEF FOR THEIR OWN ENDS AND IN FACT MAINTAIN NO BELIEF MORE ARDENTLY THAN THE BELIEF THAT THE STRONG MAN IS FREE TO BE WEAK AND THE BIRD OF PREY TO BE A LAMB‚ÄÎFOR THUS THEY GAIN THE RIGHT TO MAKE THE BIRD OF PREY ACCOUNTABLE FOR BEING A BIRD OF PREY.

WHEN THE OPPRESSED, DOWNTRODDEN, OUTRAGED EXHORT ONE ANOTHER WITH THE VENGEFUL CUNNING OF IMPOTENCE: ‚ÄÚLET US BE DIFFERENT FROM THE EVIL, NAMELY GOOD! AND HE IS GOOD WHO DOES NOT OUTRAGE, WHO HARMS NOBODY, WHO DOES NOT ATTACK, WHO DOES NOT REQUITE, WHO LEAVES REVENGE TO GOD, WHO KEEPS HIMSELF HIDDEN AS WE DO, WHO AVOIDS EVIL AND DESIRES LITTLE FROM LIFE, LIKE US, THE PATIENT, HUMBLE, AND JUST‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHIS, LISTENED TO CALMLY AND WITHOUT PREVIOUS BIAS, REALLY AMOUNTS TO NO MORE THAN: ‚ÄÚWE WEAK ONES ARE, AFTER ALL, WEAK; IT WOULD BE GOOD IF WE DID NOTHING FOR WHICH WE ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH‚ÄÙ; BUT THIS DRY MATTER OF FACT, THIS PRUDENCE OF THE LOWEST ORDER WHICH EVEN INSECTS POSSESS (POSING AS DEAD, WHEN IN GREAT DANGER, SO AS NOT TO DO ‚ÄÚTOO MUCH‚ÄÙ), HAS, THANKS TO THE COUNTERFEIT AND SELF-DECEPTION OF IMPOTENCE, CLAD ITSELF IN THE OSTENTATIOUS GARB OF THE VIRTUE OF QUIET, CALM RESIGNATION, JUST AS IF THE WEAKNESS OF THE WEAK‚ÄÎTHAT IS TO SAY, THEIR ESSENCE, THEIR EFFECTS, THEIR SOLE INELUCTABLE, IRREMOVABLE REALITY‚ÄÎWERE A VOLUNTARY ACHIEVEMENT, WILLED, CHOSEN, A DEED, A MERITORIOUS ACT. THIS TYPE OF MAN NEEDS TO BELIEVE IN A NEUTRAL INDEPENDENT ‚ÄÚSUBJECT,‚ÄÙ PROMPTED BY AN INSTINCT FOR SELF-PRESERVATION AND SELF-AFFIRMATION IN WHICH EVERY LIE IS SANCTIFIED. THE SUBJECT (OR, TO USE A MORE POPULAR EXPRESSION, THE SOUL) HAS PERHAPS BEEN BELIEVED IN HITHERTO MORE FIRMLY THAN ANYTHING ELSE ON EARTH BECAUSE IT MAKES POSSIBLE TO THE MAJORITY OF MORTALS, THE WEAK AND OPPRESSED OF EVERY KIND, THE SUBLIME SELF-DECEPTION THAT INTERPRETS WEAKNESS AS FREEDOM, AND THEIR BEING THUS-AND-THUS AS A MERIT.

WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK INTO THE SECRET OF HOW IDEALS ARE MADE ON EARTH? WHO HAS THE COURAGE?‚ÄÎVERY WELL! HERE IS A POINT WE CAN SEE THROUGH INTO THIS DARK WORKSHOP. BUT WAIT A MOMENT OR TWO, MR. RASH AND CURIOUS: YOUR EYES MUST FIRST GET USED TO THIS FALSE IRIDESCENT LIGHT.‚ÄÎALL RIGHT! NOW SPEAK! WHAT IS GOING ON DOWN THERE? SAY WHAT YOU SEE, MAN OF THE MOST PERILOUS KIND OF INQUISITIVENESS‚ÄÎNOW I AM THE ONE WHO IS LISTENING.‚ÄÎ

‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚI SEE NOTHING, BUT I HEAR THE MORE. THERE IS A SOFT, WARY, MALIGNANT MUTTERING AND WHISPERING COMING FROM ALL THE CORNERS AND NOOKS. IT SEEMS TO ME ONE IS LYING; A SACCHARINE SWEETNESS CLINGS TO EVERY SOUND. WEAKNESS IS BEING LIED INTO SOMETHING MERITORIOUS, NO DOUBT OF IT‚ÄÎSO IT IS JUST AS YOU SAID‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎ

‚ÄÎGO ON!

‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚAND IMPOTENCE WHICH DOES NOT REQUITE INTO ‚ÄÒGOODNESS OF HEART‚ÄÔ; ANXIOUS LOWLINESS INTO ‚ÄÒHUMILITY‚ÄÔ; SUBJECTION TO THOSE ONE HATES INTO ‚ÄÒOBEDIENCE‚ÄÔ (THAT IS, TO ONE OF WHOM THEY SAY HE COMMANDS THIS SUBJECTION‚ÄÎTHEY CALL HIM GOD). THE INOFFENSIVENESS OF THE WEAK MAN, EVEN THE COWARDICE OF WHICH HE HAS SO MUCH, HIS LINGERING AT THE DOOR, HIS BEING INELUCTABLY COMPELLED TO WAIT, HERE ACQUIRE FLATTERING NAMES, SUCH AS ‚ÄÒPATIENCE,‚ÄÔ AND ARE EVEN CALLED VIRTUE ITSELF; HIS INABILITY FOR REVENGE IS CALLED UNWILLINGNESS TO REVENGE, PERHAPS EVEN FORGIVENESS (‚ÄÒFOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO‚ÄÎWE ALONE KNOW WHAT THEY DO!‚ÄÔ). THEY ALSO SPEAK OF ‚ÄÒLOVING ONE‚ÄÔS ENEMIES‚ÄÔ‚ÄÎAND SWEAT AS THEY DO SO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÎGO ON!

‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚTHEY ARE MISERABLE, NO DOUBT OF IT, ALL THESE MUTTERERS AND NOOK COUNTERFEITERS, ALTHOUGH THEY CROUCH WARMLY TOGETHER‚ÄÎBUT THEY TELL ME THEIR MISERY IS A SIGN OF BEING CHOSEN BY GOD; ONE BEATS THE DOGS ONE LIKES BEST; PERHAPS THIS MISERY IS ALSO A PREPARATION, A TESTING, A SCHOOLING, PERHAPS IT IS EVEN MORE‚ÄÎSOMETHING THAT WILL ONE DAY BE MADE GOOD AND RECOMPENSED WITH INTEREST, WITH HUGE PAYMENTS OF GOLD, NO! OF HAPPINESS. THIS THEY CALL ‚ÄÒBLISS.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÎGO ON!

‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚNOW THEY GIVE ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE NOT MERELY BETTER THAN THE MIGHTY, THE LORDS OF THE EARTH WHOSE SPITTLE THEY HAVE TO LICK (NOT FROM FEAR, NOT AT ALL FROM FEAR! BUT BECAUSE GOD HAS COMMANDED THEM TO OBEY THE AUTHORITIES)1‚ÄÎTHAT THEY ARE NOT MERELY BETTER BUT ARE ALSO ‚ÄÒBETTER OFF,‚ÄÔ OR AT LEAST WILL BE BETTER OFF SOMEDAY. BUT ENOUGH! ENOUGH! I CAN‚ÄÔT TAKE ANY MORE. BAD AIR! BAD AIR! THIS WORKSHOP WHERE IDEALS ARE MANUFACTURED‚ÄÎIT SEEMS TO ME IT STINKS OF SO MANY LIES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÎNO! WAIT A MOMENT! YOU HAVE SAID NOTHING YET OF THE MASTERPIECE OF THESE BLACK MAGICIANS, WHO MAKE WHITENESS, MILK, AND INNOCENCE OF EVERY BLACKNESS‚ÄÎHAVEN‚ÄÔT YOU NOTICED THEIR PERFECTION OF REFINEMENT, THEIR BOLDEST, SUBTLEST, MOST INGENIOUS, MOST MENDACIOUS ARTISTIC STROKE? ATTEND TO THEM! THESE CELLAR RODENTS FULL OF VENGEFULNESS AND HATRED‚ÄÎWHAT HAVE THEY MADE OF REVENGE AND HATRED? HAVE YOU HEARD THESE WORDS UTTERED? IF YOU TRUSTED SIMPLY TO THEIR WORDS, WOULD YOU SUSPECT YOU WERE AMONG MEN OF RESSENTIMENT?‚Ä¶

‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚI UNDERSTAND; I‚ÄÔLL OPEN MY EARS AGAIN (OH! OH! OH! AND CLOSE MY NOSE). NOW I CAN REALLY HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG: ‚ÄÒWE GOOD MEN‚ÄÎWE ARE THE JUST‚ÄÔ‚ÄÎWHAT THEY DESIRE THEY CALL, NOT RETALIATION, BUT ‚ÄÒTHE TRIUMPH OF JUSTICE‚ÄÔ; WHAT THEY HATE IS NOT THEIR ENEMY, NO! THEY HATE ‚ÄÒINJUSTICE,‚ÄÔ THEY HATE ‚ÄÒGODLESSNESS‚ÄÔ; WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN AND HOPE FOR IS NOT THE HOPE OF REVENGE, THE INTOXICATION OF SWEET REVENGE (‚ÄÎ‚ÄÒSWEETER THAN HONEY‚ÄÔ HOMER CALLED IT), BUT THE VICTORY OF GOD, OF THE JUST GOD, OVER THE GODLESS; WHAT THERE IS LEFT FOR THEM TO LOVE ON EARTH IS NOT THEIR BROTHERS IN HATRED BUT THEIR ‚ÄÒBROTHERS IN LOVE,‚ÄÔ AS THEY PUT IT, ALL THE GOOD AND JUST ON EARTH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÎ AND WHAT DO THEY CALL THAT WHICH SERVES TO CONSOLE THEM FOR ALL THE SUFFERING OF LIFE‚ÄÎTHEIR PHANTASMAGORIA OF ANTICIPATED FUTURE BLISS?

‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚWHAT? DO I HEAR ARIGHT? THEY CALL THAT ‚ÄÒTHE LAST JUDGMENT,‚ÄÔ THE COMING OF THEIR KINGDOM, OF THE ‚ÄÒKINGDOM OF GOD‚ÄÔ‚ÄÎMEANWHILE, HOWEVER, THEY LIVE ‚ÄÒIN FAITH,‚ÄÔ ‚ÄÒIN LOVE,‚ÄÔ ‚ÄÒIN HOPE.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÎENOUGH! ENOUGH!

IN FAITH IN WHAT? IN LOVE OF WHAT? IN HOPE OF WHAT?‚ÄÎTHESE WEAK PEOPLE‚ÄÎSOME DAY OR OTHER THEY TOO INTEND TO BE THE STRONG, THERE IS NO DOUBT OF THAT, SOME DAY THEIR ‚ÄÚKINGDOM‚ÄÙ TOO SHALL COME‚ÄÎTHEY TERM IT ‚ÄÚTHE KINGDOM OF GOD,‚ÄÙ OF COURSE, AS AFORESAID: FOR ONE IS SO VERY HUMBLE IN ALL THINGS! TO EXPERIENCE THAT ONE NEEDS TO LIVE A LONG TIME, BEYOND DEATH‚ÄÎINDEED ONE NEEDS ETERNAL LIFE, SO AS TO BE ETERNALLY INDEMNIFIED IN THE ‚ÄÚKINGDOM OF GOD‚ÄÙ FOR THIS EARTHLY LIFE ‚ÄÚIN FAITH, IN LOVE, IN HOPE.‚ÄÙ INDEMNIFIED FOR WHAT? HOW INDEMNIFIED?

DANTE, I THINK, COMMITTED A CRUDE BLUNDER WHEN, WITH A TERRORINSPIRING INGENUITY, HE PLACED ABOVE THE GATEWAY OF HIS HELL THE INSCRIPTION ‚ÄÚI TOO WAS CREATED BY ETERNAL LOVE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAT ANY RATE, THERE WOULD BE MORE JUSTIFICATION FOR PLACING ABOVE THE GATEWAY TO THE CHRISTIAN PARADISE AND ITS ‚ÄÚETERNAL BLISS‚ÄÙ THE INSCRIPTION ‚ÄÚI TOO WAS CREATED BY ETERNAL HATE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎPROVIDED A TRUTH MAY BE PLACED ABOVE THE GATEWAY TO A LIE! FOR WHAT IS IT THAT CONSTITUTES THE BLISS OF THIS PARADISE?

WE MIGHT EVEN GUESS, BUT IT IS BETTER TO HAVE IT EXPRESSLY DESCRIBED FOR US BY AN AUTHORITY NOT TO BE UNDERESTIMATED IN SUCH MATTERS, THOMAS AQUINAS, THE GREAT TEACHER AND SAINT. ‚ÄÚBEATI IN REGNO COELESTI‚ÄÙ, HE SAYS, MEEK AS A LAMB, ‚ÄÚVIDEBUNT POENAS DAMNATORUM, UT BEATITUDO ILLIS MAGIS COMPLACEAT.‚ÄÙ1 OR IF ONE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IT IN A STRONGER KEY, PERHAPS FROM THE MOUTH OF A TRIUMPHANT CHURCH FATHER, ADJURING HIS CHRISTIANS TO AVOID THE CRUEL PLEASURES OF THE PUBLIC GAMES‚ÄÎBUT WHY? ‚ÄÚFOR THE FAITH OFFERS US MUCH MORE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHE SAYS, DE SPECTACULIS, CHS. 29F.‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚSOMETHING MUCH STRONGER; THANKS TO THE REDEMPTION, QUITE OTHER JOYS ARE AT OUR COMMAND; IN PLACE OF ATHLETES WE HAVE OUR MARTYRS; IF WE CRAVE BLOOD, WE HAVE THE BLOOD OF CHRIST‚Ä¶BUT THINK OF WHAT AWAITS US ON THE DAY OF HIS RETURN, THE DAY OF HIS TRIUMPH!‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND THEN HE GOES ON, THE ENRAPTURED VISIONARY.2 ‚ÄÚAT ENIM SUPERSUNT ALIA SPECTACULA, ILLE ULTIMUS ET PERPETUUS JUDICII DIES, ILLE NATIONIBUS INSPERATUS, ILLE DERISUS, CUM TANTA SAECULI VETUSTAS ET TOT EJUS NATIVITATES UNO IGNE HAURIENTUR.

LET US CONCLUDE. THE TWO OPPOSING VALUES ‚ÄÚGOOD AND BAD,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚGOOD AND EVIL‚ÄÙ HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN A FEARFUL STRUGGLE ON EARTH FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS; AND THOUGH THE LATTER VALUE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN ON TOP FOR A LONG TIME, THERE ARE STILL PLACES WHERE THE STRUGGLE IS AS YET UNDECIDED. ONE MIGHT EVEN SAY THAT IT HAS RISEN EVER HIGHER AND THUS BECOME MORE AND MORE PROFOUND AND SPIRITUAL: SO THAT TODAY THERE IS PERHAPS NO MORE DECISIVE MARK OF A ‚ÄÚHIGHER NATURE,‚ÄÙ A MORE SPIRITUAL NATURE, THAN THAT OF BEING DIVIDED IN THIS SENSE AND A GENUINE BATTLEGROUND OF THESE OPPOSED VALUES.1

THE SYMBOL OF THIS STRUGGLE, INSCRIBED IN LETTERS LEGIBLE ACROSS ALL HUMAN HISTORY, IS ‚ÄÚROME AGAINST JUDEA, JUDEA AGAINST ROME‚ÄÙ:‚ÄÎTHERE HAS HITHERTO BEEN NO GREATER EVENT THAN THIS STRUGGLE, THIS QUESTION, THIS DEADLY CONTRADICTION. ROME FELT THE JEW TO BE SOMETHING LIKE ANTI-NATURE ITSELF, ITS ANTIPODAL MONSTROSITY AS IT WERE: IN ROME THE JEW STOOD ‚ÄÚCONVICTED OF HATRED FOR THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE;‚ÄÙ AND RIGHTLY, PROVIDED ONE HAS A RIGHT TO LINK THE SALVATION AND FUTURE OF THE HUMAN RACE WITH THE UNCONDITIONAL DOMINANCE OF ARISTOCRATIC VALUES, ROMAN VALUES.

HOW, ON THE OTHER HAND, DID THE JEWS FEEL ABOUT ROME? A THOUSAND SIGNS TELL US; BUT IT SUFFICES TO RECALL THE APOCALYPSE OF JOHN, THE MOST WANTON OF ALL LITERARY OUTBURSTS THAT VENGEFULNESS HAS ON ITS CONSCIENCE. (ONE SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE PROFOUND CONSISTENCY OF THE CHRISTIAN INSTINCT WHEN IT SIGNED THIS BOOK OF HATE WITH THE NAME OF THE DISCIPLE OF LOVE, THE SAME DISCIPLE TO WHOM IT ATTRIBUTED THAT AMOROUS-ENTHUSIASTIC GOSPEL: THERE IS A PIECE OF TRUTH IN THIS, HOWEVER MUCH LITERARY COUNTERFEITING MIGHT HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO PRODUCE IT.) FOR THE ROMANS WERE THE STRONG AND NOBLE, AND NOBODY STRONGER AND NOBLER HAS YET EXISTED, ON EARTH OR EVEN BEEN DREAMED OF: EVERY REMNANT OF THEM, EVERY INSCRIPTION GIVES DELIGHT, IF ONLY ONE DIVINES WHAT IT WAS THAT WAS THERE AT WORK. THE JEWS, ON THE CONTRARY, WERE THE PRIESTLY NATION OF RESSENTIMENT PAR EXCELLENCE, IN WHOM THERE DWELT AN UNEQUALED POPULAR-MORAL GENIUS: ONE ONLY HAS TO COMPARE SIMILARLY GIFTED NATIONS‚ÄÎTHE CHINESE OR THE GERMANS, FOR INSTANCE‚ÄÎWITH THE JEWS, TO SENSE WHICH IS OF THE FIRST AND WHICH OF THE FIFTH RANK.2

WHICH OF THEM HAS WON FOR THE PRESENT, ROME OR JUDEA? BUT THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT: CONSIDER TO WHOM ONE BOWS DOWN IN ROME ITSELF TODAY, AS IF THEY WERE THE EPITOME OF ALL THE HIGHEST VALUES‚ÄÎAND NOT ONLY IN ROME BUT OVER ALMOST HALF THE EARTH, EVERYWHERE THAT MAN HAS BECOME TAME OR DESIRES TO BECOME TAME: THREE JEWS, AS IS KNOWN, AND ONE JEWESS (JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE FISHERMAN PETER, THE RUG WEAVER PAUL, AND THE MOTHER OF THE AFOREMENTIONED JESUS, NAMED MARY). THIS IS VERY REMARKABLE: ROME HAS BEEN DEFEATED BEYOND ALL DOUBT.

THERE WAS, TO BE SURE, IN THE RENAISSANCE AN UNCANNY AND GLITTERING REAWAKENING OF THE CLASSICAL IDEAL, OF THE NOBLE MODE OF EVALUATING ALL THINGS; ROME ITSELF, OPPRESSED BY THE NEW SUPERIMPOSED JUDAIZED ROME THAT PRESENTED THE ASPECT OF AN ECUMENICAL SYNAGOGUE AND WAS CALLED THE ‚ÄÚCHURCH,‚ÄÙ STIRRED LIKE ONE AWAKENED FROM SEEMING DEATH: BUT JUDEA IMMEDIATELY TRIUMPHED AGAIN, THANKS TO THAT THOROUGHLY PLEBEIAN (GERMAN AND ENGLISH) RESSENTIMENT MOVEMENT CALLED THE REFORMATION, AND TO THAT WHICH WAS BOUND TO ARISE FROM IT, THE RESTORATION OF THE CHURCH‚ÄÎTHE RESTORATION TOO OF THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRAL REPOSE OF CLASSICAL ROME.

WITH THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, JUDEA ONCE AGAIN TRIUMPHED OVER THE CLASSICAL IDEAL, AND THIS TIME IN AN EVEN MORE PROFOUND AND DECISIVE SENSE: THE LAST POLITICAL NOBLESSE IN EUROPE, THAT OF THE FRENCH SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURY, COLLAPSED BENEATH THE POPULAR INSTINCTS OF RESSENTIMENT‚ÄÎGREATER REJOICING, MORE UPROARIOUS ENTHUSIASM HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD ON EARTH! TO BE SURE, IN THE MIDST OF IT THERE OCCURRED THE MOST TREMENDOUS, THE MOST UNEXPECTED THING; THE IDEAL OF ANTIQUITY ITSELF STEPPED INCARNATE AND IN UNHEARD-OF SPLENDOR BEFORE THE EYES AND CONSCIENCE OF MANKIND‚ÄÎAND ONCE AGAIN, IN OPPOSITION TO THE MENDACIOUS SLOGAN OF RESSENTIMENT, ‚ÄÚSUPREME RIGHTS OF THE MAJORITY,‚ÄÙ IN OPPOSITION TO THE WILL TO THE LOWERING, THE ABASEMENT, THE LEVELING AND THE DECLINE AND TWILIGHT OF MANKIND, THERE SOUNDED STRONGER, SIMPLER, AND MORE INSISTENTLY THAN EVER THE TERRIBLE AND RAPTUROUS COUNTERSLOGAN ‚ÄÚSUPREME RIGHTS OF THE FEW‚ÄÙ! LIKE A LAST SIGNPOST TO THE OTHER PATH, NAPOLEON APPEARED, THE MOST ISOLATED AND LATE-BORN MAN THERE HAS EVEN BEEN, AND IN HIM THE PROBLEM OF THE NOBLE IDEAL AS SUCH MADE FLESH‚ÄÎONE MIGHT WELL PONDER WHAT KIND OF PROBLEM IT IS: NAPOLEON, THIS SYNTHESIS OF THE INHUMAN AND SUPERHUMAN.





17


WAS THAT THE END OF IT? HAD THAT GREATEST OF ALL CONFLICTS OF IDEALS BEEN PLACED AD ACTA1 FOR ALL TIME? OR ONLY ADJOURNED, INDEFINITELY ADJOURNED?

MUST THE ANCIENT FIRE NOT SOME DAY FLARE UP MUCH MORE TERRIBLY, AFTER MUCH LONGER PREPARATION? MORE: MUST ONE NOT DESIRE IT WITH ALL ONE‚ÄÔS MIGHT? EVEN WILL IT? EVEN PROMOTE IT?

WHOEVER BEGINS AT THIS POINT, LIKE MY READERS, TO REFLECT AND PURSUE HIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT WILL NOT SOON COME TO THE END OF IT‚ÄÎREASON ENOUGH FOR ME TO COME TO AN END, ASSUMING IT HAS LONG SINCE BEEN ABUNDANTLY CLEAR WHAT MY AIM IS, WHAT THE AIM OF THAT DANGEROUS SLOGAN IS THAT IS INSCRIBED AT THE HEAD OF MY LAST BOOK BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL.‚ÄÎAT LEAST THIS DOES NOT MEAN ‚ÄÚBEYOND GOOD AND BAD.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎ‚ÄÎ


NOTE.2 I TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY PROVIDED BY THIS TREATISE TO EXPRESS PUBLICLY AND FORMALLY A DESIRE I HAVE PREVIOUSLY VOICED ONLY IN OCCASIONAL CONVERSATION WITH SCHOLARS; NAMELY, THAT SOME PHILOSOPHICAL FACULTY MIGHT ADVANCE HISTORICAL STUDIES OF MORALITY THROUGH A SERIES OF ACADEMIC PRIZE-ESSAYS‚ÄÎPERHAPS THIS PRESENT BOOK WILL SERVE TO PROVIDE A POWERFUL IMPETUS IN THIS DIRECTION. IN CASE THIS IDEA SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED, I SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: IT DESERVES THE ATTENTION OF PHILOLOGISTS AND HISTORIANS AS WELL AS THAT OF PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHERS:

‚ÄÚWHAT LIGHT DOES LINGUISTICS, AND ESPECIALLY THE STUDY OF ETYMOLOGY, THROW ON THE HISTORY OF THE EVOLUTION OF MORAL CONCEPTS?‚ÄÙ

ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS EQUALLY NECESSARY TO ENGAGE THE INTEREST OF PHYSIOLOGISTS AND DOCTORS IN THESE PROBLEMS (OF THE VALUE OF EXISTING EVALUATIONS); IT MAY BE LEFT TO ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHERS TO ACT AS ADVOCATES AND MEDIATORS IN THIS MATTER TOO, AFTER THEY HAVE ON THE WHOLE SUCCEEDED IN THE PAST IN TRANSFORMING THE ORIGINALLY SO RESERVED AND MISTRUSTFUL RELATIONS BETWEEN PHILOSOPHY, PHYSIOLOGY, AND MEDICINE INTO THE MOST AMICABLE AND FRUITFUL EXCHANGE. INDEED, EVERY TABLE OF VALUES, EVERY ‚ÄÚTHOU SHALT‚ÄÙ KNOWN TO HISTORY OR ETHNOLOGY, REQUIRES FIRST A PHYSIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION AND INTERPRETATION, RATHER THAN A PSYCHOLOGICAL ONE; AND EVERY ONE OF THEM NEEDS A CRITIQUE ON THE PART OF MEDICAL SCIENCE. THE QUESTION: WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THIS OR THAT TABLE OF VALUES AND ‚ÄÚMORALS‚ÄÙ? SHOULD BE VIEWED FROM THE MOST DIVERS PERSPECTIVES; FOR THE PROBLEM ‚ÄÚVALUE FOR WHAT?‚ÄÙ CANNOT BE EXAMINED TOO SUBTLY. SOMETHING, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT POSSESSED OBVIOUS VALUE IN RELATION TO THE LONGEST POSSIBLE SURVIVAL OF A RACE (OR TO THE ENHANCEMENT OF ITS POWER OF ADAPTATION TO A PARTICULAR CLIMATE OR TO THE PRESERVATION OF THE GREATEST NUMBER) WOULD BY NO MEANS POSSESS THE SAME VALUE IF IT WERE A QUESTION, FOR INSTANCE, OF PRODUCING A STRONGER TYPE. THE WELL-BEING OF THE MAJORITY AND THE WELL-BEING OF THE FEW ARE OPPOSITE VIEWPOINTS OF VALUE: TO CONSIDER THE FORMER A PRIORI OF HIGHER VALUE MAY BE LEFT TO THE NA√ØVET√© OF ENGLISH BIOLOGISTS.‚ÄÎALL THE SCIENCES HAVE FROM NOW ON TO PREPARE THE WAY FOR THE FUTURE TASK OF THE PHILOSOPHERS: THIS TASK UNDERSTOOD AS THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF VALUE, THE DETERMINATION OF THE ORDER OF RANK AMONG VALUES.

2GREEK: GOOD, BRAVE. READERS WHO ARE NOT CLASSICAL PHILOLOGISTS MAY WONDER AS THEY READ THIS SECTION HOW WELL TAKEN NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS POINTS ABOUT THE GREEKS ARE. IN THIS CONNECTION ONE COULD OBVIOUSLY CITE A VAST LITERATURE, BUT IN THIS BRIEF COMMENTARY IT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO QUOTE PROFESSOR GERALD F. ELSE‚ÄÔS MONUMENTAL STUDY ARISTOTLE‚ÄÔS POETICS: THE ARGUMENT (CAMBRIDGE, MASS., HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS, 1957), A WORK EQUALLY NOTABLE FOR ITS PATIENT AND THOROUGH SCHOLARSHIP AND ITS SPIRITED DEFENSE OF SOME CONTROVERSIAL INTERPRETATIONS. ON THE POINTS AT ISSUE HERE, ELSE‚ÄÔS COMMENTS ARE NOT, I THINK, CONTROVERSIAL; AND THAT IS THE REASON FOR CITING THEM HERE.

THE DICHOTOMY IS ABSOLUTE AND EXCLUSIVE FOR A SIMPLE REASON: IT BEGAN AS THE ARISTOCRATS‚ÄÔ VIEW OF SOCIETY AND REFLECTS THEIR IDEA OF THE GULF BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE ‚ÄÒOTHERS.‚ÄÔ IN THE MINDS OF A COMPARATIVELY SMALL AND CLOSE-KNIT GROUP LIKE THE GREEK ARISTOCRACY THERE ARE ONLY TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE, ‚ÄÒWE‚ÄÔ AND ‚ÄÒTHEY‚ÄÔ; AND OF COURSE ‚ÄÒWE‚ÄÔ ARE THE GOOD PEOPLE, THE PROPER, DECENT, GOOD-LOOKING, RIGHT-THINKING ONES, WHILE ‚ÄÒTHEY‚ÄÔ ARE THE RASCALS, THE POLTROONS, THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGS‚Ä¶ARISTOTLE KNEW AND SYMPATHIZED WITH THIS OLDER ARISTOCRATIC, ‚ÄÒPRACTICAL‚ÄÔ IDEAL, NOT AS SUPERIOR TO THE CONTEMPLATIVE, BUT AT LEAST AS NEXT BEST TO IT‚ÄÙ (P. 75).

3THIS IS THE FIRST APPEARANCE IN NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS WRITINGS OF THE NOTORIOUS ‚ÄÚBLOND BEAST.‚ÄÙ IT IS ENCOUNTERED TWICE MORE IN THE PRESENT SECTION; A VARIANT APPEARS IN SECTION 17 OF THE SECOND ESSAY; AND THEN THE BLONDE BESTIE APPEARS ONCE MORE IN TWILIGHT, ‚ÄÚTHE ‚ÄÒIMPROVERS‚ÄÔ OF MANKIND,‚ÄÙ SECTION 2 (PORTABLE NIETZSCHE,). THAT IS ALL. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THESE PASSAGES SEE KAUFMANN‚ÄÔS NIETZSCHE, CHAPTER 7, SECTION III: ‚ÄÚ‚Ä¶THE ‚ÄÒBLOND BEAST‚ÄÔ IS NOT A RACIAL CONCEPT AND DOES NOT REFER TO THE ‚ÄÒNORDIC RACE‚ÄÔ OF WHICH THE NAZIS LATER MADE SO MUCH. NIETZSCHE SPECIFICALLY REFERS TO ARABS AND JAPANESE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÎAND THE ‚ÄÒBLONDNESS‚ÄÔ PRESUMABLY REFERS TO THE BEAST, THE LION.‚ÄÙ

FRANCIS GOLFFING, IN HIS FREE TRANSLATION OF THE GENEALOGY, DELETES THE BLOND BEAST THREE TIMES OUT OF FOUR; ONLY WHERE IT APPEARS THE SECOND TIME IN THE ORIGINAL TEXT, HE HAS ‚ÄÚTHE BLOND TEUTONIC BEAST.‚ÄÙ THIS HELPS TO CORROBORATE THE MYTH THAT THE BLONDNESS REFERS TO THE TEUTONS. WITHOUT THE IMAGE OF THE LION, HOWEVER, WE LOSE NOT ONLY SOME OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS POETRY AS WELL AS ANY CHANCE TO UNDERSTAND ONE OF HIS BEST KNOWN COINAGES; WE ALSO LOSE AN ECHO OF THE CRUCIAL FIRST CHAPTER OF ZARATHUSTRA, WHERE THE LION REPRESENTS THE SECOND STAGE IN ‚ÄÚTHE THREE METAMORPHOSES‚ÄÙ OF THE SPIRIT‚ÄÎABOVE THE OBEDIENT CAMEL BUT BELOW THE CREATIVE CHILD (PORTABLE NIETZSCHE.).

ARTHUR DANTO HAS SUGGESTED THAT IF LIONS WERE BLACK AND NIETZSCHE HAD WRITTEN ‚ÄÚBLACK BEAST,‚ÄÙ THE EXPRESSION WOULD ‚ÄÚPROVIDE SUPPORT FOR AFRICAN INSTEAD OF GERMAN NATIONALISTS‚ÄÙ (NIETZSCHE AS PHILOSOPHER, NEW YORK, MACMILLAN, 1965, P. 170). PANTHERS ARE BLACK AND MAGNIFICENT ANIMALS, BUT ANYONE CALLING NEGROES BLACK BEASTS AND ASSOCIATING THEM WITH ‚ÄÚA DISGUSTING PROCESSION OF MURDER, ARSON, RAPE, AND TORTURE,‚ÄÙ ADDING THAT ‚ÄÚTHE ANIMAL HAS TO GET OUT AGAIN AND GO BACK TO THE WILDERNESS,‚ÄÙ AND THEN GOING ON TO SPEAK OF ‚ÄÚTHEIR HAIR-RAISING CHEERFULNESS AND PROFOUND JOY IN ALL DESTRUCTION,‚ÄÙ WOULD SCARCELY BE TAKEN TO ‚ÄÚPROVIDE SUPPORT FOR‚Ä¶NATIONALISTS.‚ÄÙ ON THE CONTRARY, HE WOULD BE TAKEN FOR A HIGHLY PREJUDICED CRITIC OF THE NEGRO.

NO OTHER GERMAN WRITER OF COMPARABLE STATURE HAS BEEN A MORE EXTREME CRITIC OF GERMAN NATIONALISM THAN NIETZSCHE. FOR ALL THAT, IT IS PLAIN THAT IN THIS SECTION HE SOUGHT TO DESCRIBE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS AND ROMANS, THE GOTHS AND THE VANDALS, NOT THAT OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY GERMANS.

THEN HE WILL SURELY SEE HOW ALDOUS HUXLEY‚ÄÔS BRAVE NEW WORLD AND GEORGE ORWELL‚ÄÔS 1984‚ÄÎBUT ESPECIALLY THE FORMER‚ÄÎARE DEVELOPMENTS OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS THEME. HUXLEY, IN HIS NOVEL, USES SHAKESPEARE AS A FOIL; NIETZSCHE, IN THE PASSAGE ABOVE, HOMER.

‚ÄÚYES, AND THERE ARE OTHER SIGHTS: THAT LAST DAY OF JUDGMENT, WITH ITS EVERLASTING ISSUES; THAT DAY UNLOOKED FOR BY THE NATIONS, THE THEME OF THEIR DERISION, WHEN THE WORLD HOARY WITH AGE, AND ALL ITS MANY PRODUCTS, SHALL BE CONSUMED IN ONE GREAT FLAME! HOW VAST A SPECTACLE THEN BURSTS UPON THE EYE! WHAT THERE EXCITES MY ADMIRATION? WHAT MY DERISION? WHICH SIGHT GIVES ME JOY? WHICH ROUSES ME TO EXULTATION?‚ÄÎAS I SEE SO MANY ILLUSTRIOUS MONARCHS, WHOSE RECEPTION INTO THE HEAVENS WAS PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED, GROANING NOW IN THE LOWEST DARKNESS WITH GREAT JOVE HIMSELF, AND THOSE, TOO, WHO BORE WITNESS OF THEIR EXULTATION; GOVERNORS OF PROVINCES, TOO, WHO PERSECUTED THE CHRISTIAN NAME, IN FIRES MORE FIERCE THAN THOSE WITH WHICH IN THE DAYS OF THEIR PRIDE THEY RAGED AGAINST THE FOLLOWERS OF CHRIST. WHAT WORLD‚ÄÔS WISE MEN BESIDES, THE VERY PHILOSOPHERS, IN FACT, WHO TAUGHT THEIR FOLLOWERS THAT GOD HAD NO CONCERN IN AUGHT THAT IS SUBLUNARY, AND WERE WONT TO ASSURE THEM THAT EITHER THEY HAD NO SOULS, OR THAT THEY WOULD NEVER RETURN TO THE BODIES WHICH AT DEATH THEY HAD LEFT, NOW COVERED WITH SHAME BEFORE THE POOR DELUDED ONES, AS ONE FIRE CONSUMES THEM! POETS ALSO, TREMBLING NOT BEFORE THE JUDGMENT-SEAT OF RHADAMANTHUS OR MINOS, BUT OF THE UNEXPECTED CHRIST! I SHALL HAVE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY THEN OF HEARING THE TRAGEDIANS, LOUDER-VOICED IN THEIR OWN CALAMITY; OF VIEWING THE PLAY-ACTORS, MUCH MORE ‚ÄÒDISSOLUTE‚ÄÔ [ANOTHER TRANSLATION HAS ‚ÄÚMUCH LITHER OF LIMB‚ÄÙ] IN THE DISSOLVING FLAME; OF LOOKING UPON THE CHARIOTEER, ALL GLOWING IN HIS CHARIOT OF FIRE; OF BEHOLDING THE WRESTLERS, NOT IN THEIR GYMNASIA, BUT TOSSING IN THE FIERY BILLOWS; UNLESS EVEN THEN I SHALL NOT CARE TO ATTEND TO SUCH MINISTERS OF SIN, IN MY EAGER WISH RATHER TO FIX A GAZE INSATIABLE ON THOSE WHOSE FURY VENTED ITSELF AGAINST THE LORD. ‚ÄÒTHIS,‚ÄÔ I SHALL SAY, ‚ÄÒTHIS IS THAT CARPENTER‚ÄÔS OR HIRELING‚ÄÔS SON, THAT SABBATH-BREAKER, THAT SAMARITAN AND DEVIL-POSSESSED! THIS IS HE WHOM YOU PURCHASED FROM JUDAS! [QUAESTUARIA MEANS PROSTITUTE, NOT CARPENTER: SEE NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS PARENTHESIS ABOVE.] THIS IS HE WHOM YOU STRUCK WITH REED AND FIST, WHOM YOU CONTEMPTUOUSLY SPAT UPON, TO WHOM YOU GAVE GALL AND VINEGAR TO DRINK! THIS IS HE WHOM HIS DISCIPLES SECRETLY STOLE AWAY, THAT IT MIGHT BE SAID HE HAD RISEN AGAIN, OR THE GARDENER ABSTRACTED, THAT HIS LETTUCES MIGHT COME TO NO HARM FROM THE CROWDS OF VISITANTS!‚ÄÔ WHAT QUAESTOR OR PRIEST IN HIS MUNIFICENCE WILL BESTOW ON YOU THE FAVOUR OF SEEING AND EXULTING IN SUCH THINGS AS THESE? AND YET EVEN NOW WE IN A MEASURE HAVE THEM BY FAITH IN THE PICTURINGS OF IMAGINATION. BUT WHAT ARE THE THINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT SEEN, EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND WHICH HAVE NOT SO MUCH AS DIMLY DAWNED UPON THE HUMAN HEART? WHATEVER THEY ARE, THEY ARE NOBLER, I BELIEVE, THAN CIRCUS, AND BOTH THEATRES, AND EVERY RACE-COURSE.‚ÄÙ [TRANSLATION BY THE REV. S. THELWALL.] THERE ARE TWO STANDARD TRANSLATIONS OF TERTULLIAN‚ÄÔS DE SPECTACULIS. ONE IS BY THE REV. S. THELWALL IN THE ANTE-NICENE FATHERS: TRANSLATIONS OF THE WRITINGS OF THE FATHERS DOWN TO A.D. 325, EDITED BY THE REV. ALEXANDER ROBERTS, D.D. AND JAMES DONALDSON, LL.D., IN VOLUME III: LATIN CHRISTIANITY: ITS FOUNDER, TERTULLIAN (AMERICAN REPRINT OF THE EDINBURGH EDITION, GRAND RAPIDS, MICH., WM. B. EERDSCILICET MANS PUBLISHING COMPANY, 1957). THE OTHER TRANSLATION IS BY RUDOLPH ARBESMANN, O.S.A., PH.D., FORDHAM UNIVERSITY, IN THE FATHERS OF THE CHURCH: A NEW TRANSLATION, IN THE VOLUME ENTITLED TERTULLIAN: DISCIPLINARY, MORAL AND ASCETICAL WORKS (NEW YORK, FATHERS OF THE CHURCH, INC., 1959, IMPRIMATUR FRANCIS CARDINAL SPELLMAN).

IN THE FORMER EDITION WE ARE TOLD IN A FOOTNOTE TO THE TITLE THAT ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN SOME DISPUTE AS TO WHETHER THE WORK WAS WRITTEN BEFORE OR AFTER TERTULLIAN‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚLAPSE‚ÄÙ FROM ORTHODOXY TO MONTANISM, ‚ÄÚA WORK SO COLOURLESS THAT DOCTORS CAN DISAGREE ABOUT EVEN ITS SHADING, MUST BE REGARDED AS PRACTICALLY ORTHODOX. EXAGGERATED EXPRESSIONS ARE BUT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AUTHOR‚ÄÔS GENIUS. WE FIND THE LIKE IN ALL WRITERS OF STRONGLY MARKED INDIVIDUALITY. NEANDER DATES THIS TREATISE CIRCA A.D. 197.‚ÄÙ AND IN A FOOTNOTE TO THE LAST SENTENCE QUOTED BY NIETZSCHE, WHICH CONCLUDES THE LAST CHAPTER OF THE TREATISE, WE READ: ‚ÄÚTHIS CONCLUDING CHAPTER, WHICH GIBBON DELIGHTS TO CENSURE, BECAUSE ITS FERVID RHETORIC SO FEARFULLY DEPICTS THE PUNISHMENTS OF CHRIST‚ÄÔS ENEMIES, ‚ÄÒAPPEARS TO DR. NEANDER TO CONTAIN A BEAUTIFUL SPECIMEN OF LIVELY FAITH AND CHRISTIAN CONFIDENCE.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

IN THE LATTER EDITION WE ARE INFORMED THAT ‚ÄÚDE SPECTACULIS IS ONE OF TERTULLIAN‚ÄÔS MOST INTERESTING AND ORIGINAL WORKS‚ÄÙ (P. 38). AND CHAPTER 30, WHICH NIETZSCHE QUOTES ALMOST IN ITS ENTIRETY, OMITTING ONLY THE FIRST FOUR LINES, IS INTRODUCED BY A FOOTNOTE THAT BEGINS (AND IT CONTINUES IN THE SAME VEIN): ‚ÄÚTERTULLIAN GIVES HERE A COLORFUL DESCRIPTION OF THE MILLENNIUM, PICTURING THE FEVERISH EXPECTATION OF AN EARLY RETURN OF CHRIST‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT THE PROTESTANT EDITION FINDS THE WORK ‚ÄÚSO COLOURLESS,‚ÄÙ WHILE THE ROMAN CATHOLIC EDITION CONSIDERS IT ‚ÄÚCOLORFUL‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND NEITHER OF THEM EVINCES ANY SENSITIVITY TO WHAT OUTRAGED NIETZSCHE OR GIBBON.

EDWARD GIBBON‚ÄÔS COMMENTS ARE FOUND IN CHAPTER XV OF THE HISTORY OF THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE: ‚ÄÚTHE CONDEMNATION OF THE WISEST AND MOST VIRTUOUS OF THE PAGANS, ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR IGNORANCE OR DISBELIEF OF THE DIVINE TRUTH, SEEMS TO OFFEND THE REASON AND THE HUMANITY OF THE PRESENT AGE. BUT THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH, WHOSE FAITH WAS OF A MUCH FIRMER CONSISTENCE, DELIVERED OVER, WITHOUT HESITATION, TO ETERNAL TORTURE THE FAR GREATER PART OF THE HUMAN SPECIES‚Ä¶. THESE RIGID SENTIMENTS, WHICH HAD BEEN UNKNOWN TO THE ANCIENT WORLD, APPEAR TO HAVE INFUSED A SPIRIT OF BITTERNESS INTO A SYSTEM OF LOVE AND HARMONY‚Ä¶. THE CHRISTIANS, WHO, IN THIS WORLD, FOUND THEMSELVES OPPRESSED BY THE POWER OF THE PAGANS, WERE SOMETIMES SEDUCED BY RESENTMENT AND SPIRITUAL PRIDE TO DELIGHT IN THE PROSPECT OF THEIR FUTURE TRIUMPH. ‚ÄÒYOU ARE FOND OF SPECTACLES,‚ÄÔ EXCLAIMS THE STERN TERTULLIAN; ‚ÄÒEXCEPT THE GREATEST OF ALL SPECTACLES, THE LAST AND ETERNAL JUDGMENT OF THE UNIVERSE. HOW SHALL I ADMIRE, HOW LAUGH‚Ä¶‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

1THIS REMARK WHICH RECALLS BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, SECTION 200, IS ENTIRELY IN KEEPING WITH THE WAY IN WHICH THE CONTRAST OF MASTER AND SLAVE MORALITY IS INTRODUCED IN BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, SECTION 260; AND IT OUGHT NOT TO BE OVERLOOKED. IT SHEDS A GOOD DEAL OF LIGHT NOT ONLY ON THIS CONTRAST BUT ALSO ON NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS AMOR FATI, HIS LOVE OF FATE. THOSE WHO IGNORE ALL THIS MATERIAL ARE BOUND COMPLETELY TO MISUNDERSTAND NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS MORAL PHILOSOPHY.

2HAVING SAID THINGS THAT CAN EASILY BE MISCONSTRUED AS GRIST TO THE MILL OF THE GERMAN ANTI-SEMITES, NIETZSCHE GOES OUT OF HIS WAY, AS USUAL, TO EXPRESS HIS ADMIRATION FOR THE JEWS AND HIS DISDAIN FOR THE GERMANS.

FORGETTING IS NO MERE VIS INERTIAE2 AS THE SUPERFICIAL IMAGINE; IT IS RATHER AN ACTIVE AND IN THE STRICTEST SENSE POSITIVE FACULTY OF REPRESSION,3 THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FACT THAT WHAT WE EXPERIENCE AND ABSORB ENTERS OUR CONSCIOUSNESS AS LITTLE WHILE WE ARE DIGESTING IT (ONE MIGHT CALL THE PROCESS ‚ÄÚINPSYCHATION‚ÄÙ) AS DOES THE THOUSANDFOLD PROCESS, INVOLVED IN PHYSICAL NOURISHMENT‚ÄÎSO-CALLED ‚ÄÚINCORPORATION.‚ÄÙ TO CLOSE THE DOORS AND WINDOWS OF CONSCIOUSNESS FOR A TIME; TO REMAIN UNDISTURBED BY THE NOISE AND STRUGGLE OF OUR UNDERWORLD OF UTILITY ORGANS WORKING WITH AND AGAINST ONE ANOTHER; A LITTLE QUIETNESS, A LITTLE TABULA RASA4 OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS, TO MAKE ROOM FOR NEW THINGS, ABOVE ALL FOR THE NOBLER FUNCTIONS AND FUNCTIONARIES, FOR REGULATION, FORESIGHT, PREMEDITATION (FOR OUR ORGANISM IS AN OLIGARCHY)‚ÄÎTHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF ACTIVE FORGETFULNESS, WHICH IS LIKE A DOORKEEPER, A PRESERVER OF PSYCHIC ORDER, REPOSE, AND ETIQUETTE: SO THAT IT WILL BE IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS HOW THERE COULD BE NO HAPPINESS, NO CHEERFULNESS, NO HOPE, NO PRIDE, NO PRESENT, WITHOUT FORGETFULNESS. THE MAN IN WHOM THIS APPARATUS OF REPRESSION IS DAMAGED AND CEASES TO FUNCTION PROPERLY MAY BE COMPARED (AND MORE THAN MERELY COMPARED) WITH A DYSPEPTIC‚ÄÎHE CANNOT ‚ÄÚHAVE DONE‚ÄÙ WITH ANYTHING.

NOW THIS ANIMAL WHICH NEEDS TO BE FORGETFUL, IN WHICH FORGETTING REPRESENTS A FORCE, A FORM OF ROBUST HEALTH, HAS BRED IN ITSELF AN OPPOSING FACULTY, A MEMORY, WITH THE AID OF WHICH FORGETFULNESS IS ABROGATED IN CERTAIN CASES‚ÄÎNAMELY IN THOSE CASES WHERE PROMISES ARE MADE. THIS INVOLVES NO MERE PASSIVE INABILITY TO RID ONESELF OF AN IMPRESSION, NO MERE INDIGESTION THROUGH A ONCE-PLEDGED WORD WITH WHICH ONE CANNOT ‚ÄÚHAVE DONE,‚ÄÙ BUT AN ACTIVE DESIRE NOT TO RID ONESELF, A DESIRE FOR THE CONTINUANCE OF SOMETHING DESIRED ONCE, A REAL MEMORY OF THE WILL: SO THAT BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL ‚ÄÚI WILL,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚI SHALL DO THIS‚ÄÙ AND THE ACTUAL DISCHARGE OF THE WILL, ITS ACT, WORLD OF STRANGE NEW THINGS, CIRCUMSTANCES, EVEN ACTS OF WILL MAY BE INTERPOSED WITHOUT BREAKING THIS LONG CHAIN OF WILL. BUT HOW MANY THINGS THIS PRESUPPOSES! TO ORDAIN THE FUTURE IN ADVANCE IN THIS WAY, MAN MUST FIRST HAVE LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH NECESSARY EVENTS FROM CHANCE ONES, TO THINK CAUSALLY, TO SEE AND ANTICIPATE DISTANT EVENTUALITIES AS IF THEY BELONGED TO THE PRESENT, TO DECIDE WITH CERTAINTY WHAT IS THE GOAL AND WHAT THE MEANS TO IT, AND IN GENERAL BE ABLE TO CALCULATE AND COMPUTE. MAN HIMSELF MUST FIRST OF ALL HAVE BECOME CALCULABLE, REGULAR, NECESSARY, EVEN IN HIS OWN IMAGE OF HIMSELF, IF HE IS TO BE ABLE TO STAND SECURITY FOR HIS OWN FUTURE, WHICH IS WHAT ONE WHO PROMISES DOES!

THIS PRECISELY IS THE LONG STORY OF HOW RESPONSIBILITY ORIGINATED. THE TASK OF BREEDING AN ANIMAL WITH THE RIGHT TO MAKE PROMISES EVIDENTLY EMBRACES AND PRESUPPOSES AS A PREPARATORY TASK THAT ONE FIRST MAKES MEN TO A CERTAIN DEGREE NECESSARY, UNIFORM, LIKE AMONG LIKE, REGULAR, AND CONSEQUENTLY CALCULABLE. THE TREMENDOUS LABOR OF THAT WHICH I HAVE CALLED ‚ÄÚMORALITY OF MORES‚ÄÙ (DAWN, SECTIONS 9, 14, 16)1‚ÄÎTHE LABOR PERFORMED BY MAN UPON HIMSELF DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE HUMAN RACE, HIS ENTIRE PREHISTORIC LABOR, FINDS IN THIS ITS MEANING, ITS GREAT JUSTIFICATION, NOTWITHSTANDING THE SEVERITY, TYRANNY, STUPIDITY, AND IDIOCY INVOLVED IN IT: WITH THE AID OF THE MORALITY OF MORES AND THE SOCIAL STRAITJACKET, MAN WAS ACTUALLY MADE CALCULABLE.

IF WE PLACE OURSELVES AT THE END OF THIS TREMENDOUS PROCESS, WHERE THE TREE AT LAST BRINGS FORTH FRUIT, WHERE SOCIETY AND THE MORALITY OF CUSTOM AT LAST REVEAL WHAT THEY HAVE SIMPLY BEEN THE MEANS TO: THEN WE DISCOVER THAT THE RIPEST FRUIT IS THE SOVEREIGN INDIVIDUAL, LIKE ONLY TO HIMSELF, LIBERATED AGAIN FROM MORALITY OF CUSTOM, AUTONOMOUS AND SUPRAMORAL (FOR ‚ÄÚAUTONOMOUS‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚMORAL‚ÄÙ ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE),2 IN SHORT, THE MAN WHO HAS HIS OWN INDEPENDENT, PROTRACTED WILL AND THE RIGHT TO MAKE PROMISES‚ÄÎAND IN HIM A PROUD CONSCIOUSNESS, QUIVERING IN EVERY MUSCLE, OF WHAT HAS AT LENGTH BEEN ACHIEVED AND BECOME FLESH IN HIM, A CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS OWN POWER AND FREEDOM, A SENSATION OF MANKIND COME TO COMPLETION. THIS EMANCIPATED INDIVIDUAL, WITH THE ACTUAL RIGHT TO MAKE PROMISES, THIS MASTER OF A FREE WILL, THIS SOVEREIGN MAN‚ÄÎHOW SHOULD HE NOT BE AWARE OF HIS SUPERIORITY OVER ALL THOSE WHO LACK THE RIGHT TO MAKE PROMISES AND STAND AS THEIR OWN GUARANTORS, OF HOW MUCH TRUST, HOW MUCH FEAR, HOW MUCH REVERENCE HE AROUSES‚ÄÎHE ‚ÄÚDESERVES‚ÄÙ ALL THREE‚ÄÎAND OF HOW THIS MASTERY OVER HIMSELF ALSO NECESSARILY GIVES HIM MASTERY OVER CIRCUMSTANCES, OVER NATURE, AND OVER ALL MORE SHORT-WILLED AND UNRELIABLE CREATURES? THE ‚ÄÚFREE‚ÄÙ MAN, THE POSSESSOR OF A PROTRACTED AND UNBREAKABLE WILL, ALSO POSSESSES HIS MEASURE OF VALUE: LOOKING OUT UPON OTHERS FROM HIMSELF, HE HONORS OR HE DESPISES; AND JUST AS HE IS BOUND TO HONOR HIS PEERS, THE STRONG AND RELIABLE (THOSE WITH THE RIGHT TO MAKE PROMISES)‚ÄÎTHAT IS, ALL THOSE WHO PROMISE LIKE SOVEREIGNS, RELUCTANTLY, RARELY, SLOWLY, WHO ARE CHARY OF TRUSTING, WHOSE TRUST IS A MARK OF DISTINCTION, WHO GIVE THEIR WORD AS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE RELIED ON BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEMSELVES STRONG ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN IT IN THE FACE OF ACCIDENTS, EVEN ‚ÄÚIN THE FACE OF FATE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHE IS BOUND TO RESERVE A KICK FOR THE FEEBLE WINDBAGS WHO PROMISE WITHOUT THE RIGHT TO DO SO, AND A ROD FOR THE LIAR WHO BREAKS HIS WORD EVEN AT THE MOMENT HE UTTERS IT. THE PROUD AWARENESS OF THE EXTRAORDINARY PRIVILEGE OF RESPONSIBILITY, THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THIS RARE FREEDOM, THIS POWER OVER ONESELF AND OVER FATE, HAS IN HIS CASE PENETRATED TO THE PROFOUNDEST DEPTHS AND BECOME INSTINCT, THE DOMINATING INSTINCT. WHAT WILL HE CALL THIS DOMINATING INSTINCT, SUPPOSING HE FEELS THE NEED TO GIVE IT A NAME? THE ANSWER IS BEYOND DOUBT: THIS SOVEREIGN MAN CALLS IT HIS CONSCIENCE.

HIS CONSCIENCE?‚ÄÎIT IS EASY TO GUESS THAT THE CONCEPT OF ‚ÄÚCONSCIENCE‚ÄÙ THAT WE HERE ENCOUNTER IN ITS HIGHEST, ALMOST ASTONISHING, MANIFESTATION, HAS A LONG HISTORY AND VARIETY OF FORMS BEHIND IT TO POSSESS THE RIGHT TO STAND SECURITY FOR ONESELF AND TO DO SO WITH PRIDE, THUS TO POSSESS ALSO THE RIGHT TO AFFIRM ONESELF‚ÄÎTHIS, AS HAS BEEN SAID, IS A RIPE FRUIT, BUT ALSO A LATE FRUIT: HOW LONG MUST THIS FRUIT HAVE HUNG ON THE TREE, UNRIPE AND SOUR! AND FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME NOTHING WHATEVER WAS TO BE SEEN OF ANY SUCH FRUIT: NO ONE COULD HAVE PROMISED ITS APPEARANCE, ALTHOUGH EVERYTHING IN THE TREE WAS PREPARING FOR AND GROWING TOWARD IT!

‚ÄÚHOW CAN ONE CREATE A MEMORY FOR THE HUMAN ANIMAL? HOW CAN ONE IMPRESS‚ÄÔSOMETHING UPON THIS PARTLY OBTUSE, PARTLY FLIGHTY MIND, ATTUNED ONLY TO THE PASSING MOMENT, IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT WILL STAY THERE?‚ÄÙ

ONE CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT THE ANSWERS AND METHODS FOR SOLVING THIS PRIMEVAL PROBLEM WERE NOT PRECISELY GENTLE; PERHAPS INDEED THERE WAS NOTHING MORE FEARFUL AND UNCANNY IN THE WHOLE PREHISTORY OF MAN THAN HIS MNEMOTECHNICS. ‚ÄÚIF SOMETHING IS TO STAY IN THE MEMORY IT MUST BE BURNED IN: ONLY THAT WHICH NEVER CEASES TO HURT STAYS IN THE MEMORY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHIS IS A MAIN CLAUSE OF THE OLDEST (UNHAPPILY ALSO THE MOST ENDURING) PSYCHOLOGY ON EARTH. ONE MIGHT EVEN SAY THAT WHEREVER ON EARTH SOLEMNITY, SERIOUSNESS, MYSTERY, AND GLOOMY COLORING STILL DISTINGUISH THE LIFE OF MAN AND A PEOPLE, SOMETHING OF THE TERROR THAT FORMERLY ATTENDED ALL PROMISES, PLEDGES, AND VOWS ON EARTH IS STILL EFFECTIVE: THE PAST, THE LONGEST, DEEPEST AND STERNEST PAST, BREATHES UPON US AND RISES UP IN US WHENEVER WE BECOME ‚ÄÚSERIOUS.‚ÄÙ MAN COULD NEVER DO WITHOUT BLOOD, TORTURE, AND SACRIFICES WHEN HE FELT THE NEED TO CREATE A MEMORY FOR HIMSELF; THE MOST DREADFUL SACRIFICES AND PLEDGES (SACRIFICES OF THE FIRST-BORN AMONG THEM), THE MOST REPULSIVE MUTILATIONS (CASTRATION, FOR EXAMPLE), THE CRUDEST RITES OF ALL THE RELIGIOUS CULTS (AND ALL RELIGIONS ARE AT THE DEEPEST LEVEL SYSTEMS OF CRUELTIES)‚ÄÎALL THIS HAS ITS ORIGIN IN THE INSTINCT THAT REALIZED THAT PAIN IS THE MOST POWERFUL AID TO MNEMONICS.

IN A CERTAIN SENSE, THE WHOLE OF ASCETICISM BELONGS HERE: A FEW IDEAS ARE TO BE RENDERED INEXTINGUISHABLE, EVER-PRESENT, UNFORGET-ABLE, ‚ÄÚFIXED,‚ÄÙ WITH THE AIM OF HYPNOTISING THE ENTIRE NERVOUS AND INTELLECTUAL SYSTEM WITH THESE ‚ÄÚFIXED IDEAS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND ASCETIC PROCEDURES AND MODES OF LIFE ARE MEANS OF FREEING THESE IDEAS FROM THE COMPETITION OF ALL OTHER IDEAS, SO AS TO MAKE THEM ‚ÄÚUNFORGETTABLE.‚ÄÙ THE WORSE MAN‚ÄÔS MEMORY HAS BEEN, THE MORE FEARFUL HAS BEEN THE APPEARANCE OF HIS CUSTOMS; THE SEVERITY OF THE PENAL CODE PROVIDES AN ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT MEASURE OF THE DEGREE OF EFFORT NEEDED TO OVERCOME FORGETFULNESS AND TO IMPOSE A FEW PRIMITIVE DEMANDS OF SOCIAL EXISTENCE AS PRESENT REALITIES UPON THESE SLAVES OF MOMENTARY AFFECT AND DESIRE.

WE GERMANS CERTAINLY DO NOT REGARD OURSELVES AS A PARTICULARLY CRUEL AND HARDHEARTED PEOPLE, STILL LESS AS A PARTICULARLY FRIVOLOUS ONE, LIVING ONLY FOR THE DAY; BUT ONE HAS ONLY TO LOOK AT OUR FORMER CODES OF PUNISHMENTS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT EFFORT IT COSTS ON THIS EARTH TO BREED A ‚ÄÚNATION OF THINKERS‚ÄÙ (WHICH IS TO SAY, THE NATION IN EUROPE IN WHICH ONE STILL FINDS TODAY THE MAXIMUM OF TRUST, SERIOUSNESS, LACK OF TASTE, AND MATTER-OF-FACTNESS‚ÄÎAND WITH THESE QUALITIES ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO BREED EVERY KIND OF EUROPEAN MANDARIN). THESE GERMANS HAVE EMPLOYED FEARFUL MEANS TO ACQUIRE A MEMORY, SO AS TO MASTER THEIR BASIC MOB-INSTINCT AND ITS BRUTAL COARSENESS. CONSIDER THE OLD GERMAN PUNISHMENTS; FOR EXAMPLE, STONING (THE SAGAS ALREADY HAVE MILLSTONES DROP ON THE HEAD OF THE GUILTY), BREAKING ON THE WHEEL (THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC INVENTION AND SPECIALITY OF THE GERMAN GENIUS IN THE REALM OF PUNISHMENT!), PIERCING WITH STAKES, TEARING APART OR TRAMPLING BY HORSES (‚ÄÚQUARTERING‚ÄÙ), BOILING OF THE CRIMINAL IN OIL OR WINE (STILL EMPLOYED IN THE FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURIES), THE POPULAR FLAYING ALIVE (‚ÄÚCUTTING STRAPS‚ÄÙ), CUTTING FLESH FROM THE CHEST, AND ALSO THE PRACTICE OF SMEARING THE WRONGDOER WITH HONEY AND LEAVING HIM IN THE BLAZING SUN FOR THE FLIES. WITH THE AID OF SUCH IMAGES AND PROCEDURES ONE FINALLY REMEMBERS FIVE OR SIX ‚ÄÚI WILL NOT‚ÄÔS,‚ÄÙ IN REGARD TO WHICH ONE HAD GIVEN ONE‚ÄÔS PROMISE SO AS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ADVANTAGES OF SOCIETY‚ÄÎAND IT WAS INDEED WITH THE AID OF THIS KIND OF MEMORY THAT ONE AT LAST CAME ‚ÄÚTO REASON‚ÄÙ! AH, REASON, SERIOUSNESS, MASTERY OVER THE AFFECTS, THE WHOLE SOMBER THING CALLED REFLECTION, ALL THESE PREROGATIVES AND SHOWPIECES OF MAN: HOW DEARLY THEY HAVE BEEN BOUGHT! HOW MUCH BLOOD AND CRUELTY LIE AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL ‚ÄÚGOOD THINGS‚ÄÙ!

BUT HOW DID THAT OTHER ‚ÄÚSOMBER THING,‚ÄÙ THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF GUILT, THE ‚ÄÚBAD CONSCIENCE,‚ÄÙ COME INTO THE WORLD?‚ÄÎ AND AT THIS POINT WE RETURN TO THE GENEALOGISTS OF MORALS. TO SAY IT AGAIN‚ÄÎOR HAVEN‚ÄÔT I SAID IT YET?‚ÄÎTHEY ARE WORTHLESS. A BRIEF SPAN OF EXPERIENCE THAT IS MERELY ONE‚ÄÔS OWN, MERELY MODERN; NO KNOWLEDGE OR WILL TO KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST; EVEN LESS OF HISTORICAL INSTINCT, OF THAT ‚ÄÚSECOND SIGHT‚ÄÙ NEEDED HERE ABOVE ALL‚ÄÎAND YET THEY UNDERTAKE HISTORY OF MORALITY: IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEIR RESULTS STAY AT A MORE THAN RESPECTFUL DISTANCE FROM THE TRUTH. HAVE THESE GENEALOGISTS OF MORALS HAD EVEN THE REMOTEST SUSPICION THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, THE MAJOR MORAL CONCEPT SCHULD [GUILT] HAS ITS ORIGIN IN THE VERY MATERIAL CONCEPT SCHULDEN [DEBTS]?1 OR THAT PUNISHMENT, AS REQUITAL, EVOLVED QUITE INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY PRESUPPOSITION CONCERNING FREEDOM OR NON-FREEDOM OF THE WILL?‚ÄÎTO SUCH AN EXTENT, INDEED, THAT A HIGH DEGREE OF HUMANITY HAD TO BE ATTAINED BEFORE THE ANIMAL ‚ÄÚMAN‚ÄÙ BEGAN EVEN TO MAKE THE MUCH MORE PRIMITIVE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ‚ÄÚINTENTIONAL,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚNEGLIGENT,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚACCIDENTAL,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚACCOUNTABLE,‚ÄÙ AND THEIR OPPOSITES AND TO TAKE THEM INTO ACCOUNT WHEN DETERMINING PUNISHMENTS. THE IDEA, NOW SO OBVIOUS, APPARENTLY SO NATURAL, EVEN UNAVOIDABLE, THAT HAD TO SERVE AS THE EXPLANATION OF HOW THE SENSE OF JUSTICE EVER APPEARED ON EARTH‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚTHE CRIMINAL DESERVES PUNISHMENT BECAUSE HE COULD HAVE ACTED DIFFERENTLY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎIS IN FACT AN EXTREMELY LATE AND SUBTLE FORM OF HUMAN JUDGMENT AND INFERENCE: WHOEVER TRANSPOSES IT TO THE BEGINNING IS GUILTY OF A CRUDE MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MORE PRIMITIVE MANKIND. THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF HUMAN HISTORY PUNISHMENT WAS NOT IMPOSED BECAUSE ONE HELD THE WRONGDOER RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS DEED, THUS NOT ON THE PRESUPPOSITION THAT ONLY THE GUILTY ONE SHOULD BE PUNISHED: RATHER, AS PARENTS STILL PUNISH THEIR CHILDREN, FROM ANGER AT SOME HARM OR INJURY, VENTED ON THE ONE WHO CAUSED IT‚ÄÎBUT THIS ANGER IS HELD IN CHECK AND MODIFIED BY THE IDEA THAT EVERY INJURY HAS ITS EQUIVALENT AND CAN ACTUALLY BE PAID BACK, EVEN IF ONLY THROUGH THE PAIN OF THE CULPRIT. AND WHENCE DID THIS PRIMEVAL, DEEPLY ROOTED, PERHAPS BY NOW INERADICABLE IDEA DRAW ITS POWER‚ÄÎTHIS IDEA OF AN EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN INJURY AND PAIN? I HAVE ALREADY DIVULGED IT: IN THE CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CREDITOR AND DEBTOR, WHICH IS AS OLD AS THE IDEA OF ‚ÄÚLEGAL SUBJECTS‚ÄÙ AND IN TURN POINTS BACK TO THE FUNDAMENTAL FORMS OF BUYING, SELLING, BARTER, TRADE, AND TRAFFIC.

WHEN WE CONTEMPLATE THESE CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS, TO BE SURE, WE FEEL CONSIDERABLE SUSPICION AND REPUGNANCE TOWARD THOSE MEN OF THE PAST WHO CREATED OR PERMITTED THEM. THIS WAS TO BE EXPECTED FROM WHAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY NOTED. IT WAS HERE THAT PROMISES WERE MADE; IT WAS HERE THAT A MEMORY HAD TO BE MADE FOR THOSE WHO PROMISED; IT IS HERE, ONE SUSPECTS, THAT WE SHALL FIND A GREAT DEAL OF SEVERITY, CRUELTY, AND PAIN. TO INSPIRE TRUST IN HIS PROMISE TO REPAY, TO PROVIDE A GUARANTEE OF THE SERIOUSNESS AND SANCTITY OF HIS PROMISE, TO IMPRESS REPAYMENT AS A DUTY, AN OBLIGATION UPON HIS OWN CONSCIENCE, THE DEBTOR MADE A CONTRACT WITH THE CREDITOR AND PLEDGED THAT IF HE SHOULD FAIL TO REPAY HE WOULD SUBSTITUTE SOMETHING ELSE THAT HE ‚ÄÚPOSSESSED,‚ÄÙ SOMETHING HE HAD CONTROL OVER; FOR EXAMPLE, HIS BODY, HIS WIFE, HIS FREEDOM, OR EVEN HIS LIFE (OR, GIVEN CERTAIN RELIGIOUS PRESUPPOSITIONS, EVEN HIS BLISS AFTER DEATH, THE SALVATION OF HIS SOUL, ULTIMATELY HIS PEACE IN THE GRAVE: THUS IT WAS IN EGYPT, WHERE THE DEBTOR‚ÄÔS CORPSE FOUND NO PEACE FROM THE CREDITOR EVEN IN THE GRAVE‚ÄÎAND AMONG THE EGYPTIANS SUCH PEACE MEANT A GREAT DEAL). ABOVE ALL, HOWEVER, THE CREDITOR COULD INFLICT EVERY KIND OF INDIGNITY AND TORTURE UPON THE BODY OF THE DEBTOR; FOR EXAMPLE, CUT FROM IT AS MUCH AS SEEMED COMMENSURATE WITH THE SIZE OF THE DEBT‚ÄÎAND EVERYWHERE AND FROM EARLY TIMES ONE HAD EXACT EVALUATIONS, LEGAL EVALUATIONS, OF THE INDIVIDUAL LIMBS AND PARTS OF THE BODY FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW, SOME OF THEM GOING INTO HORRIBLE AND MINUTE DETAIL. I CONSIDER IT AS AN ADVANCE, AS EVIDENCE OF A FREER, MORE GENEROUS, MORE ROMAN CONCEPTION OF LAW WHEN THE TWELVE TABLES OF ROME DECREED IT A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE HOW MUCH OR HOW LITTLE THE CREDITOR CUT OFF IN SUCH CASES: ‚ÄÚSI PLUS MINUSVE SECUERUNT, NE FRAUDE ESTO.‚ÄÙ1

LET US BE CLEAR AS TO THE LOGIC OF THIS FORM OF COMPENSATION: IT IS STRANGE ENOUGH. AN EQUIVALENCE IS PROVIDED BY THE CREDITOR‚ÄÔS RECEIVING, IN PLACE OF A LITERAL COMPENSATION FOR AN INJURY (THUS IN PLACE OF MONEY, LAND, POSSESSIONS OF ANY KIND), A RECOMPENSE IN THE FORM OF A KIND OF PLEASURE‚ÄÎTHE PLEASURE OF BEING ALLOWED TO VENT HIS POWER FREELY UPON ONE WHO IS POWERLESS, THE VOLUPTUOUS PLEASURE ‚ÄÚDE FAIRE LE MAL POUR LE PLAISIR DE LE FAIRE,‚ÄÙ2 THE ENJOYMENT OF VIOLATION. THIS ENJOYMENT WILL BE THE GREATER THE LOWER THE CREDITOR STANDS IN THE SOCIAL ORDER, AND CAN EASILY APPEAR TO HIM AS A MOST DELICIOUS MORSEL, INDEED AS A FORETASTE OF HIGHER RANK. IN ‚ÄÚPUNISHING‚ÄÙ THE DEBTOR, THE CREDITOR PARTICIPATES IN A RIGHT OF THE MASTERS: AT LAST HE, TOO, MAY EXPERIENCE FOR ONCE THE EXALTED SENSATION OF BEING ALLOWED TO DESPISE AND MISTREAT SOMEONE AS ‚ÄÚBENEATH HIM‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎOR AT LEAST, IF THE ACTUAL POWER AND ADMINISTRATION OF PUNISHMENT HAS ALREADY PASSED TO THE ‚ÄÚAUTHORITIES,‚ÄÙ TO SEE HIM DESPISED AND MISTREATED. THE COMPENSATION, THEN, CONSISTS IN A WARRANT FOR AND TITLE TO CRUELTY.‚ÄÎ

IT WAS IN THIS SPHERE THEN, THE SPHERE OF LEGAL OBLIGATIONS, THAT THE MORAL CONCEPTUAL WORLD OF ‚ÄÚGUILT,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚCONSCIENCE,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚDUTY,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚSACREDNESS OF DUTY‚ÄÙ HAD ITS ORIGIN: ITS BEGINNINGS WERE, LIKE THE BEGINNINGS OF EVERYTHING GREAT ON EARTH, SOAKED IN BLOOD THOROUGHLY AND FOR A LONG TIME. AND MIGHT ONE NOT ADD THAT, FUNDAMENTALLY, THIS WORLD HAS NEVER SINCE LOST A CERTAIN ODOR OF BLOOD AND TORTURE? (NOT EVEN IN GOOD OLD KANT: THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE SMELLS OF CRUELTY.) IT WAS HERE, TOO, THAT THAT UNCANNY INTERTWINING OF THE IDEAS ‚ÄÚGUILT AND SUFFERING‚ÄÙ WAS FIRST EFFECTED‚ÄÎAND BY NOW THEY MAY WELL BE INSEPARABLE. TO ASK IT AGAIN: TO WHAT EXTENT CAN SUFFERING BALANCE DEBTS OR GUILT?3 TO THE EXTENT THAT TO MAKE SUFFER WAS IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE PLEASURABLE, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE INJURED PARTY EXCHANGED FOR THE LOSS HE HAD SUSTAINED, INCLUDING THE DISPLEASURE CAUSED BY THE LOSS, AN EXTRAORDINARY COUNTERBALANCING PLEASURE: THAT OF MAKING SUFFER‚ÄÎA GENUINE FESTIVAL, SOMETHING WHICH, AS AFORESAID, WAS PRIZED THE MORE HIGHLY THE MORE VIOLENTLY IT CONTRASTED WITH THE RANK AND SOCIAL STANDING OF THE CREDITOR. THIS IS OFFERED ONLY AS A CONJECTURE; FOR THE DEPTHS OF SUCH SUBTERRANEAN THINGS ARE DIFFICULT TO FATHOM, BESIDES BEING PAINFUL; AND WHOEVER CLUMSILY INTERPOSES THE CONCEPT OF ‚ÄÚREVENGE‚ÄÙ DOES NOT ENHANCE HIS INSIGHT INTO THE MATTER BUT FURTHER VEILS AND DARKENS IT (‚ÄÎFOR REVENGE MERELY LEADS US BACK TO THE SAME PROBLEM: ‚ÄÚHOW CAN MAKING SUFFER CONSTITUTE A COMPENSATION?‚ÄÙ).

IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE DELICACY AND EVEN MORE THE TARTUFFERY OF TAME DOMESTIC ANIMALS (WHICH IS TO SAY MODERN MEN, WHICH IS TO SAY US) RESISTS A REALLY VIVID COMPREHENSION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH CRUELTY CONSTITUTED THE GREAT FESTIVAL PLEASURE OF MORE PRIMITIVE MEN AND WAS INDEED AN INGREDIENT OF ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THEIR PLEASURES; AND HOW NAIVELY, HOW INNOCENTLY THEIR THIRST FOR CRUELTY MANIFESTED ITSELF, HOW, AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE, THEY POSITED ‚ÄÚDISINTERESTED MALICE‚ÄÙ (OR, IN SPINOZA‚ÄÔS WORDS, SYMPATHIA MALEVOLENS) AS A NORMAL QUALITY OF MAN‚ÄÎAND THUS AS SOMETHING TO WHICH THE CONSCIENCE CORDIALLY SAYS YES! A MORE PROFOUND EYE MIGHT PERCEIVE ENOUGH OF THIS OLDEST AND MOST FUNDAMENTAL FESTIVAL PLEASURE OF MAN EVEN IN OUR TIME; IN BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, SECTION 2294 (AND EARLIER IN THE DAWN, SECTIONS 18, 77, 113)5 I POINTED CAUTIOUSLY TO THE EVER-INCREASING SPIRITUALIZATION AND ‚ÄÚDEIFICATION‚ÄÙ OF CRUELTY WHICH PERMEATES THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF HIGHER CULTURE (AND IN A SIGNIFICANT SENSE ACTUALLY CONSTITUTES IT). IN ANY EVENT, IT IS NOT LONG SINCE PRINCELY WEDDINGS AND PUBLIC FESTIVALS OF THE MORE MAGNIFICENT KIND WERE UNTHINKABLE WITHOUT EXECUTIONS, TORTURINGS, OR PERHAPS AN AUTO-DA-F√©, AND NO NOBLE HOUSEHOLD WAS WITHOUT CREATURES UPON WHOM ONE COULD HEEDLESSLY VENT ONE‚ÄÔS MALICE AND CRUEL JOKES. (CONSIDER, FOR INSTANCE, DON QUIXOTE AT THE COURT OF THE DUCHESS. TODAY WE READ DON QUIXOTE WITH A BITTER TASTE IN OUR MOUTHS, ALMOST WITH A FEELING OF TORMENT, AND WOULD THUS SEEM VERY STRANGE AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ITS AUTHOR AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES: THEY READ IT WITH THE CLEAREST CONSCIENCE IN THE WORLD AS THE MOST CHEERFUL OF BOOKS, THEY LAUGHED THEMSELVES ALMOST TO DEATH OVER IT). TO SEE OTHERS SUFFER DOES ONE GOOD, TO MAKE OTHERS SUFFER EVEN MORE: THIS IS A HARD SAYING BUT AN ANCIENT, MIGHTY, HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN PRINCIPLE TO WHICH EVEN THE APES MIGHT SUBSCRIBE; FOR IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT IN DEVISING BIZARRE CRUELTIES THEY ANTICIPATE MAN AND ARE, AS IT WERE, HIS ‚ÄÚPRELUDE.‚ÄÙ WITHOUT CRUELTY THERE IS NO FESTIVAL: THUS THE LONGEST AND MOST ANCIENT PART OF HUMAN HISTORY TEACHES‚ÄÎAND IN PUNISHMENT THERE IS SO MUCH THAT IS FESTIVE!‚ÄÎ

WITH THIS IDEA, BY THE WAY, I AM BY NO MEANS CONCERNED TO FURNISH OUR PESSIMISTS WITH MORE GRIST FOR THEIR DISCORDANT AND CREAKING MILLS OF LIFE-SATIETY. ON THE CONTRARY, LET ME DECLARE EXPRESSLY THAT IN THE DAYS WHEN MANKIND WAS NOT YET ASHAMED OF ITS CRUELTY, LIFE ON EARTH WAS MORE CHEERFUL THAN IT IS NOW THAT PESSIMISTS EXIST. THE DARKENING OF THE SKY ABOVE MANKIND HAS DEEPENED IN STEP WITH THE INCREASE IN MAN‚ÄÔS FEELING OF SHAME AT MAN. THE WEARY PESSIMISTIC GLANCE, MISTRUST OF THE RIDDLE OF LIFE, THE ICY NO OF DISGUST WITH LIFE‚ÄÎTHESE DO NOT CHARACTERIZE THE MOST EVIL EPOCHS OF THE HUMAN RACE: RATHER DO THEY FIRST STEP INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY AS THE SWAMP WEEDS THEY ARE WHEN THE SWAMP TO WHICH THEY BELONG COMES INTO BEING‚ÄÎI MEAN THE MORBID SOFTENING AND MORALIZATION THROUGH WHICH THE ANIMAL ‚ÄÚMAN‚ÄÙ FINALLY LEARNS TO BE ASHAMED OF ALL HIS INSTINCTS. ON HIS WAY TO BECOMING AN ‚ÄÚANGEL‚ÄÙ (TO EMPLOY NO UGLIER WORD) MAN HAS EVOLVED THAT QUEASY STOMACH AND COATED TONGUE THROUGH WHICH NOT ONLY THE JOY AND INNOCENCE OF THE ANIMAL BUT LIFE ITSELF HAS BECOME REPUGNANT TO HIM‚ÄÎSO THAT HE SOMETIMES HOLDS HIS NOSE IN HIS OWN PRESENCE AND, WITH POPE INNOCENT THE THIRD, DISAPPROVINGLY CATALOGUES HIS OWN REPELLENT ASPECTS (‚ÄÚIMPURE BEGETTING, DISGUSTING MEANS OF NUTRITION IN HIS MOTHER‚ÄÔS WOMB, BASENESS OF THE MATTER OUT OF WHICH MAN EVOLVES, HIDEOUS STINK, SECRETION OF SALIVA, URINE, AND FILTH‚ÄÙ).

TODAY, WHEN SUFFERING IS ALWAYS BROUGHT FORWARD AS THE PRINCIPAL ARGUMENT AGAINST EXISTENCE, AS THE WORST QUESTION MARK, ONE DOES WELL TO RECALL THE AGES IN WHICH THE OPPOSITE OPINION PREVAILED BECAUSE MEN WERE UNWILLING TO REFRAIN FROM MAKING SUFFER AND SAW IN IT AN ENCHANTMENT OF THE FIRST ORDER, A GENUINE SEDUCTION TO LIFE. PERHAPS IN THOSE DAYS‚ÄÎTHE DELICATE MAY BE COMFORTED BY THIS THOUGHT‚ÄÎPAIN DID NOT HURT AS MUCH AS IT DOES NOW; AT LEAST THAT IS THE CONCLUSION A DOCTOR MAY ARRIVE AT WHO HAS TREATED NEGROES (TAKEN AS REPRESENTATIVES OF PREHISTORIC MAN‚ÄÎ) FOR SEVERE INTERNAL INFLAMMATIONS THAT WOULD DRIVE EVEN THE BEST CONSTITUTED EUROPEAN TO DISTRACTION‚ÄÎIN THE CASE OF NEGROES THEY DO NOT DO SO. (THE CURVE OF HUMAN SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PAIN SEEMS IN FACT TO TAKE AN EXTRAORDINARY AND ALMOST SUDDEN DROP AS SOON AS ONE HAS PASSED THE UPPER TEN THOUSAND OR TEN MILLION OF THE TOP STRATUM OF CULTURE; AND FOR MY OWN PART, I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE COMBINED SUFFERING OF ALL THE ANIMALS EVER SUBJECTED TO THE KNIFE FOR SCIENTIFIC ENDS IS UTTERLY NEGLIGIBLE COMPARED WITH ONE PAINFUL NIGHT OF A SINGLE HYSTERICAL BLUESTOCKING.) PERHAPS THE POSSIBILITY MAY EVEN BE ALLOWED THAT THIS JOY IN CRUELTY DOES NOT REALLY HAVE TO HAVE DIED OUT: IF PAIN HURTS MORE TODAY, IT SIMPLY REQUIRES A CERTAIN SUBLIMATION AND SUBTILIZATION, THAT IS TO SAY IT HAS TO APPEAR TRANSLATED INTO THE IMAGINATIVE AND PSYCHICAL AND ADORNED WITH SUCH INNOCENT NAMES THAT EVEN THE TENDEREST AND MOST HYPOCRITICAL CONSCIENCE IS NOT SUSPICIOUS OF THEM (‚ÄÚTRAGIC PITY‚ÄÙ IS ONE SUCH NAME; ‚ÄÚLES NOSTALGIES DE LA CROIX‚ÄÙ6 IS ANOTHER).

WHAT REALLY AROUSES INDIGNATION AGAINST SUFFERING IS NOT SUFFERING AS SUCH BUT THE SENSELESSNESS OF SUFFERING: BUT NEITHER FOR THE CHRISTIAN, WHO HAS INTERPRETED A WHOLE MYSTERIOUS MACHINERY OF SALVATION INTO SUFFERING, NOR FOR THE NA√ØVE MAN OF MORE ANCIENT TIMES, WHO UNDERSTOOD ALL SUFFERING IN RELATION TO THE SPECTATOR OF IT OR THE CAUSER OF IT, WAS THERE ANY SUCH THING AS SENSELESS SUFFERING. SO AS TO ABOLISH HIDDEN, UNDETECTED, UNWITNESSED SUFFERING FROM THE WORLD AND HONESTLY TO DENY IT, ONE WAS IN THE PAST VIRTUALLY COMPELLED TO INVENT GODS AND GENII OF ALL THE HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS, IN SHORT SOMETHING THAT ROAMS EVEN IN SECRET, HIDDEN PLACES, SEES EVEN IN THE DARK, AND WILL NOT EASILY LET AN INTERESTING PAINFUL SPECTACLE PASS UNNOTICED. FOR IT WAS WITH THE AID OF SUCH INVENTIONS THAT LIFE THEN KNEW HOW TO WORK THE TRICK WHICH IT HAS ALWAYS KNOWN HOW TO WORK, THAT OF JUSTIFYING ITSELF, OF JUSTIFYING ITS ‚ÄÚEVIL.‚ÄÙ NOWADAYS IT MIGHT REQUIRE OTHER AUXILIARY INVENTIONS (FOR EXAMPLE, LIFE AS A RIDDLE, LIFE AS AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL PROBLEM). ‚ÄÚEVERY EVIL THE SIGHT OF WHICH EDIFIES A GOD IS JUSTIFIED‚ÄÙ: THUS SPOKE THE PRIMITIVE LOGIC OF FEELING‚ÄÎAND WAS IT, INDEED, ONLY PRIMITIVE? THE GODS CONCEIVED OF AS THE FRIENDS OF CRUEL SPECTACLES‚ÄÎOH HOW PROFOUNDLY THIS ANCIENT IDEA STILL PERMEATES OUR EUROPEAN HUMANITY! MERELY CONSULT CALVIN AND LUTHER. IT IS CERTAIN, AT ANY RATE, THAT THE GREEKS STILL KNEW OF NO TASTIER SPICE TO OFFER THEIR GODS TO SEASON THEIR HAPPINESS THAN THE PLEASURES OF CRUELTY. WITH WHAT EYES DO YOU THINK HOMER MADE HIS GODS LOOK DOWN UPON THE DESTINIES OF MEN? WHAT WAS AT BOTTOM THE ULTIMATE MEANING OF TROJAN WARS AND OTHER SUCH TRAGIC TERRORS? THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT WHATEVER: THEY WERE INTENDED AS FESTIVAL PLAYS FOR THE GODS; AND, INSOFAR AS THE POET IS IN THESE MATTERS OF A MORE ‚ÄÚGODLIKE‚ÄÙ DISPOSITION THAN OTHER MEN, NO DOUBT ALSO AS FESTIVAL PLAYS FOR THE POETS.

IT WAS IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE MORAL PHILOSOPHERS OF GREECE LATER IMAGINED THE EYES OF GOD LOOKING DOWN UPON THE MORAL STRUGGLE, UPON THE HEROISM AND SELF-TORTURE OF THE VIRTUOUS: THE ‚ÄÚHERAKLES OF DUTY‚ÄÙ WAS ON A STAGE AND KNEW HIMSELF TO BE; VIRTUE WITHOUT A WITNESS WAS SOMETHING UNTHINKABLE FOR THIS NATION OF ACTORS. SURELY, THAT PHILOSOPHERS‚ÄÔ INVENTION, SO BOLD AND SO FATEFUL, WHICH WAS THEN FIRST DEVISED FOR EUROPE, THE INVENTION OF ‚ÄÚFREE WILL,‚ÄÙ OF THE ABSOLUTE SPONTANEITY OF MAN IN GOOD AND IN EVIL, WAS DEVISED ABOVE ALL TO FURNISH A RIGHT TO THE IDEA THAT THE INTEREST OF THE GODS IN MAN, IN HUMAN VIRTUE, COULD NEVER BE EXHAUSTED. THERE MUST NEVER BE ANY LACK OF REAL NOVELTY, OF REALLY UNPRECEDENTED TENSIONS, COMPLICATIONS, AND CATASTROPHIES ON THE STAGE OF THE EARTH: THE COURSE OF A COMPLETELY DETERMINISTIC WORLD WOULD HAVE BEEN PREDICTABLE FOR THE GODS AND THEY WOULD HAVE QUICKLY GROWN WEARY OF IT‚ÄÎREASON ENOUGH FOR THOSE FRIENDS OF THE GODS, THE PHILOSOPHERS, NOT TO INFLICT SUCH A DETERMINISTIC WORLD ON THEIR GODS! THE ENTIRE MANKIND OF ANTIQUITY IS FULL OF TENDER REGARD FOR ‚ÄÚTHE SPECTATOR,‚ÄÙ AS AN ESSENTIALLY PUBLIC, ESSENTIALLY VISIBLE WORLD WHICH CANNOT IMAGINE HAPPINESS APART FROM SPECTACLES AND FESTIVALS.‚ÄÎ AND, AS AFORESAID, EVEN IN GREAT PUNISHMENT THERE IS SO MUCH THAT IS FESTIVE!

TO RETURN TO OUR INVESTIGATION: THE FEELING OF GUILT, OF PERSONAL OBLIGATION, HAD ITS ORIGIN, AS WE SAW, IN THE OLDEST AND MOST PRIMITIVE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP, THAT BETWEEN BUYER AND SELLER, CREDITOR AND DEBTOR: IT WAS HERE THAT ONE PERSON FIRST ENCOUNTERED ANOTHER PERSON, THAT ONE PERSON FIRST MEASURED HIMSELF AGAINST ANOTHER. NO GRADE OF CIVILIZATION, HOWEVER LOW, HAS YET BEEN DISCOVERED IN WHICH SOMETHING OF THIS RELATIONSHIP HAS NOT BEEN NOTICEABLE. SETTING PRICES, DETERMINING VALUES, CONTRIVING EQUIVALENCES, EXCHANGING‚ÄÎTHESE PREOCCUPIED THE EARLIEST THINKING OF MAN TO SO GREAT AN EXTENT THAT IN A CERTAIN SENSE THEY CONSTITUTE THINKING AS SUCH: HERE IT WAS THAT THE OLDEST KIND OF ASTUTENESS DEVELOPED; HERE LIKEWISE, WE MAY SUPPOSE, DID HUMAN PRIDE, THE FEELING OF SUPERIORITY IN RELATION TO OTHER ANIMALS, HAVE ITS FIRST BEGINNINGS. PERHAPS OUR WORD ‚ÄÚMAN‚ÄÙ (MANAS) STILL EXPRESSES SOMETHING OF PRECISELY THIS FEELING OF SELF-SATISFACTION: MAN DESIGNATED HIMSELF AS THE CREATURE THAT MEASURES VALUES, EVALUATES AND MEASURES, AS THE ‚ÄÚVALUATING ANIMAL AS SUCH.‚ÄÙ

BUYING AND SELLING, TOGETHER WITH THEIR PSYCHOLOGICAL APPURTENANCES, ARE OLDER EVEN THAN THE BEGINNINGS OF ANY KIND OF SOCIAL FORMS OF ORGANIZATION AND ALLIANCES: IT WAS RATHER OUT OF THE MOST RUDIMENTARY FORM OF PERSONAL LEGAL RIGHTS THAT THE BUDDING SENSE OF EXCHANGE, CONTRACT, GUILT, RIGHT, OBLIGATION, SETTLEMENT, FIRST TRANSFERRED ITSELF TO THE COARSEST AND MOST ELEMENTARY SOCIAL COMPLEXES (IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH OTHER SIMILAR COMPLEXES), TOGETHER WITH THE CUSTOM OF COMPARING, MEASURING, AND CALCULATING POWER AGAINST POWER. THE EYE WAS NOW FOCUSED ON THIS PERSPECTIVE; AND WITH THAT BLUNT CONSISTENCY CHARACTERISTIC OF THE THINKING OF PRIMITIVE MANKIND, WHICH IS HARD TO SET IN MOTION BUT THEN PROCEEDS INEXORABLY IN THE SAME DIRECTION, ONE FORTHWITH ARRIVED AT THE GREAT GENERALIZATION, ‚ÄÚEVERYTHING HAS ITS PRICE; ALL THINGS CAN BE PAID FOR‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHE OLDEST AND NA√ØVEST MORAL CANON OF JUSTICE, THE BEGINNING OF ALL ‚ÄÚGOOD-NATUREDNESS,‚ÄÙ ALL ‚ÄÚFAIRNESS,‚ÄÙ ALL ‚ÄÚGOOD WILL,‚ÄÙ ALL ‚ÄÚOBJECTIVITY‚ÄÙ ON EARTH. JUSTICE ON THIS ELEMENTARY LEVEL IS THE GOOD WILL AMONG PARTIES OF APPROXIMATELY EQUAL POWER TO COME TO TERMS WITH ONE ANOTHER, TO REACH AN ‚ÄÚUNDERSTANDING‚ÄÙ BY MEANS OF A SETTLEMENT‚ÄÎAND TO COMPEL PARTIES OF LESSER POWER TO REACH A SETTLEMENT AMONG THEMSELVES.‚ÄÎ

STILL RETAINING THE CRITERIA OF PREHISTORY (THIS PREHISTORY IS IN ANY CASE PRESENT IN ALL AGES OR MAY ALWAYS REAPPEAR)1: THE COMMUNITY, TOO, STANDS TO ITS MEMBERS IN THAT SAME VITAL BASIC RELATION, THAT OF THE CREDITOR TO HIS DEBTORS. ONE LIVES IN A COMMUNITY, ONE ENJOYS THE ADVANTAGES OF A COMMUNALITY (OH WHAT ADVANTAGES! WE SOMETIMES UNDERRATE THEM TODAY), ONE DWELLS PROTECTED, CARED FOR, IN PEACE AND TRUSTFULNESS, WITHOUT FEAR OF CERTAIN INJURIES AND HOSTILE ACTS TO WHICH THE MAN OUTSIDE, THE ‚ÄÚMAN WITHOUT PEACE,‚ÄÙ IS EXPOSED‚ÄÎA GERMAN WILL UNDERSTAND THE ORIGINAL CONNOTATIONS OF ELEND2‚ÄÎSINCE ONE HAS BOUND AND PLEDGED ONESELF TO THE COMMUNITY PRECISELY WITH A VIEW TO INJURIES AND HOSTILE ACTS. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THIS PLEDGE IS BROKEN? THE COMMUNITY, THE DISAPPOINTED CREDITOR, WILL GET WHAT REPAYMENT IT CAN, ONE MAY DEPEND ON THAT. THE DIRECT HARM CAUSED BY THE CULPRIT IS HERE A MINOR MATTER; QUITE APART FROM THIS, THE LAWBREAKER IS ABOVE ALL A ‚ÄÚBREAKER,‚ÄÙ A BREAKER OF HIS CONTRACT AND HIS WORD WITH THE WHOLE IN RESPECT TO ALL THE BENEFITS AND COMFORTS OF COMMUNAL LIFE OF WHICH HE HAS HITHERTO HAD A SHARE. THE LAWBREAKER IS A DEBTOR WHO HAS NOT MERELY FAILED TO MAKE GOOD THE ADVANTAGES AND ADVANCE PAYMENTS BESTOWED UPON HIM BUT HAS ACTUALLY ATTACKED HIS CREDITOR: THEREFORE HE IS NOT ONLY DEPRIVED HENCEFORTH OF ALL THESE ADVANTAGES AND BENEFITS, AS IS FAIR‚ÄÎHE IS ALSO REMINDED WHAT THESE BENEFITS ARE REALLY WORTH. THE WRATH OF THE DISAPPOINTED CREDITOR, THE COMMUNITY, THROWS HIM BACK AGAIN INTO THE SAVAGE AND OUTLAW STATE AGAINST WHICH HE HAS HITHERTO BEEN PROTECTED: IT THRUSTS HIM AWAY‚ÄÎAND NOW EVERY KIND OF HOSTILITY MAY BE VENTED UPON HIM. ‚ÄÚPUNISHMENT‚ÄÙ AT THIS LEVEL OF CIVILIZATION IS SIMPLY A COPY, A MIMUS, OF THE NORMAL ATTITUDE TOWARD A HATED, DISARMED, PROSTRATED ENEMY, WHO HAS LOST NOT ONLY EVERY RIGHT AND PROTECTION, BUT ALL HOPE OF QUARTER AS WELL; IT IS THUS THE RIGHTS OF WAR AND THE VICTORY CELEBRATION OF THE VAE VICTIS!3 IN ALL THEIR MERCILESSNESS AND CRUELTY‚ÄÎWHICH EXPLAINS WHY IT IS THAT WAR ITSELF (INCLUDING THE WARLIKE SACRIFICIAL CULT) HAS PROVIDED ALL THE FORMS THAT PUNISHMENT HAS ASSUMED THROUGHOUT HISTORY.

AS ITS POWER INCREASES, A COMMUNITY CEASES TO TAKE THE INDIVIDUAL‚ÄÔS TRANSGRESSIONS SO SERIOUSLY, BECAUSE THEY CAN NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED AS DANGEROUS AND DESTRUCTIVE TO THE WHOLE AS THEY WERE FORMERLY: THE MALEFACTOR IS NO LONGER ‚ÄÚSET BEYOND THE PALE OF PEACE‚ÄÙ AND THRUST OUT; UNIVERSAL ANGER MAY NOT BE VENTED UPON HIM AS UNRESTRAINEDLY AS BEFORE‚ÄÎON THE CONTRARY, THE WHOLE FROM NOW ON CAREFULLY DEFENDS THE MALEFACTOR AGAINST THIS ANGER, ESPECIALLY THAT OF THOSE HE HAS DIRECTLY HARMED, AND TAKES HIM UNDER ITS PROTECTION. A COMPROMISE WITH THE ANGER OF THOSE DIRECTLY INJURED BY THE CRIMINAL; AN EFFORT TO LOCALIZE THE AFFAIR AND TO PREVENT IT FROM CAUSING ANY FURTHER, LET ALONE A GENERAL, DISTURBANCE; ATTEMPTS TO DISCOVER EQUIVALENTS AND TO SETTLE THE WHOLE MATTER (COMPOSITIO); ABOVE ALL, THE INCREASINGLY DEFINITE WILL TO TREAT EVERY CRIME AS IN SOME SENSE DISCHARGEABLE, AND THUS AT LEAST TO A CERTAIN EXTENT TO ISOLATE THE CRIMINAL AND HIS DEED FROM ONE ANOTHER‚ÄÎTHESE TRAITS BECOME MORE AND MORE CLEARLY VISIBLE AS THE PENAL LAW EVOLVES. AS THE POWER AND SELF-CONFIDENCE OF A COMMUNITY INCREASE, THE PENAL LAW ALWAYS BECOMES MORE MODERATE; EVERY WEAKENING OR IMPERILING OF THE FORMER BRINGS WITH IT A RESTORATION OF THE HARSHER FORMS OF THE LATTER. THE ‚ÄÚCREDITOR‚ÄÙ ALWAYS BECOMES MORE HUMANE TO THE EXTENT THAT HE HAS GROWN RICHER; FINALLY, HOW MUCH INJURY HE CAN ENDURE WITHOUT SUFFERING FROM IT BECOMES THE ACTUAL MEASURE OF HIS WEALTH. IT IS NOT UNTHINKABLE THAT A SOCIETY MIGHT ATTAIN SUCH A CONSCIOUSNESS OF POWER THAT IT COULD ALLOW ITSELF THE NOBLEST LUXURY POSSIBLE TO IT‚ÄÎLETTING THOSE WHO HARM IT GO UNPUNISHED. ‚ÄÚWHAT ARE MY PARASITES TO ME?‚ÄÙ IT MIGHT SAY. ‚ÄÚMAY THEY LIVE AND PROSPER: I AM STRONG ENOUGH FOR THAT!‚ÄÙ

THE JUSTICE WHICH BEGAN WITH, ‚ÄÚEVERYTHING IS DISCHARGEABLE, EVERYTHING MUST BE DISCHARGED,‚ÄÙ ENDS BY WINKING AND LETTING THOSE INCAPABLE OF DISCHARGING THEIR DEBT GO FREE: IT ENDS, AS DOES EVERY GOOD THING ON EARTH, BY OVERCOMING ITSELF.1 THIS SELF-OVERCOMING OF JUSTICE: ONE KNOWS THE BEAUTIFUL NAME IT HAS GIVEN ITSELF‚ÄÎMERCY; IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT MERCY REMAINS THE PRIVILEGE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MAN, OR BETTER, HIS‚ÄÎBEYOND THE LAW.2

HERE A WORD IN REPUDIATION OF ATTEMPTS THAT HAVE LATELY BEEN MADE TO SEEK THE ORIGIN OF JUSTICE IN QUITE A DIFFERENT SPHERE‚ÄÎNAMELY IN THAT OF RESSENTIMENT. TO THE PSYCHOLOGISTS FIRST OF ALL, PRESUMING THEY WOULD LIKE TO STUDY RESSENTIMENT CLOSE UP FOR ONCE, I WOULD SAY: THIS PLANT BLOOMS BEST TODAY AMONG ANARCHISTS AND ANTI-SEMITES‚ÄÎWHERE IT HAS ALWAYS BLOOMED, IN HIDDEN PLACES, LIKE THE VIOLET, THOUGH WITH A DIFFERENT ODOR. AND AS LIKE MUST ALWAYS PRODUCE LIKE, IT CAUSES US NO SURPRISE TO SEE A REPETITION IN SUCH CIRCLES OF ATTEMPTS OFTEN MADE BEFORE‚ÄÎSEE ABOVE, SECTION 14‚ÄÎTO SANCTIFY REVENGE1 UNDER THE NAME OF JUSTICE2‚ÄÎAS IF JUSTICE WERE AT BOTTOM MERELY A FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE FEELING OF BEING AGGRIEVED‚ÄÎAND TO REHABILITATE NOT ONLY REVENGE BUT ALL REACTIVE AFFECTS IN GENERAL. TO THE LATTER AS SUCH I WOULD BE THE LAST TO RAISE ANY OBJECTION: IN RESPECT TO THE ENTIRE BIOLOGICAL PROBLEM (IN RELATION TO WHICH THE VALUE OF THESE AFFECTS HAS HITHERTO BEEN UNDERRATED) IT EVEN SEEMS TO ME TO CONSTITUTE A SERVICE. ALL I DRAW ATTENTION TO IS THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IT IS THE SPIRIT OF RESSENTIMENT ITSELF OUT OF WHICH THIS NEW NUANCE OF SCIENTIFIC FAIRNESS (FOR THE BENEFIT OF HATRED, ENVY, JEALOUSY, MISTRUST, RANCOR, AND REVENGE) PROCEEDS. FOR THIS ‚ÄÚSCIENTIFIC FAIRNESS‚ÄÙ IMMEDIATELY CEASES AND GIVES WAY TO ACCENTS OF DEADLY ENMITY AND PREJUDICE ONCE IT IS A QUESTION OF DEALING WITH ANOTHER GROUP OF AFFECTS, AFFECTS THAT, IT SEEMS TO ME, ARE OF EVEN GREATER BIOLOGICAL VALUE THAN THOSE REACTIVE AFFECTS AND CONSEQUENTLY DESERVE EVEN MORE TO BE SCIENTIFICALLY EVALUATED AND ESTEEMED: NAMELY, THE TRULY ACTIVE AFFECTS, SUCH AS LUST FOR POWER, AVARICE, AND THE LIKE. (E. D√ºHRING:3 THE VALUE OF LIFE; A COURSE IN PHILOSOPHY; AND, FUNDAMENTALLY, PASSIM.)

SO MUCH AGAINST THIS TENDENCY IN GENERAL: AS FOR D√ºHRING‚ÄÔS SPECIFIC PROPOSITION THAT THE HOME OF JUSTICE IS TO BE SOUGHT IN THE SPHERE OF THE REACTIVE FEELINGS, ONE IS OBLIGED FOR TRUTH‚ÄÔS SAKE TO COUNTER IT WITH A BLUNT ANTITHESIS: THE LAST SPHERE TO BE CONQUERED BY THE SPIRIT OF JUSTICE IS THE SPHERE OF THE REACTIVE FEELINGS! WHEN IT REALLY HAPPENS THAT THE JUST MAN REMAINS JUST EVEN TOWARD THOSE WHO HAVE HARMED HIM (AND NOT MERELY COLD, TEMPERATE, REMOTE, INDIFFERENT: BEING JUST IS ALWAYS A POSITIVE ATTITUDE), WHEN THE EXALTED, CLEAR OBJECTIVITY, AS PENETRATING AS IT IS MILD, OF THE EYE OF JUSTICE AND JUDGING IS NOT DIMMED EVEN UNDER THE ASSAULT OF PERSONAL INJURY, DERISION, AND CALUMNY, THIS IS A PIECE OF PERFECTION AND SUPREME MASTERY ON EARTH‚ÄÎSOMETHING IT WOULD BE PRUDENT NOT TO EXPECT OR TO BELIEVE IN TOO READILY. ON THE AVERAGE, A SMALL DOSE OF AGGRESSION, MALICE, OR INSINUATION CERTAINLY SUFFICES TO DRIVE THE BLOOD INTO THE EYES‚ÄÎAND FAIRNESS OUT OF THE EYES‚ÄÎOF EVEN THE MOST UPRIGHT PEOPLE. THE ACTIVE, AGGRESSIVE, ARROGANT MAN IS STILL A HUNDRED STEPS CLOSER TO JUSTICE THAN THE REACTIVE MAN; FOR HE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO NEED TO TAKE A FALSE AND PREJUDICED VIEW OF THE OBJECT BEFORE HIM IN THE WAY THE REACTIVE MAN DOES AND IS BOUND TO DO. FOR THAT REASON THE AGGRESSIVE MAN, AS THE STRONGER, NOBLER, MORE COURAGEOUS, HAS IN FACT ALSO HAD AT ALL TIMES A FREER EYE, A BETTER CONSCIENCE ON HIS SIDE: CONVERSELY, ONE CAN SEE WHO HAS THE INVENTION OF THE ‚ÄÚBAD CONSCIENCE‚ÄÙ ON HIS CONSCIENCE‚ÄÎTHE MAN OF RESSENTIMENT!

FINALLY, ONE ONLY HAS TO LOOK AT HISTORY: IN WHICH SPHERE HAS THE ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION OF LAW4 HITHERTO BEEN AT HOME‚ÄÎALSO THE NEED FOR LAW? IN THE SPHERE OF REACTIVE MEN, PERHAPS? BY NO MEANS: RATHER IN THAT OF THE ACTIVE, STRONG, SPONTANEOUS, AGGRESSIVE. FROM A HISTORICAL POINT OF VIEW, LAW REPRESENTS ON EARTH‚ÄÎLET IT BE SAID TO THE DISMAY OF THE ABOVE-NAMED AGITATOR (WHO HIMSELF ONCE CONFESSED: ‚ÄÚTHE DOCTRINE OF REVENGE IS THE RED THREAD OF JUSTICE THAT RUNS THROUGH ALL MY WORK AND EFFORTS‚ÄÙ)‚ÄÎTHE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE REACTIVE FEELINGS, THE WAR CONDUCTED AGAINST THEM ON THE PART OF THE ACTIVE AND AGGRESSIVE POWERS WHO EMPLOYED SOME OF THEIR STRENGTH TO IMPOSE MEASURE AND BOUNDS UPON THE EXCESSES OF THE REACTIVE PATHOS AND TO COMPEL IT TO COME TO TERMS. WHEREVER JUSTICE IS PRACTICED AND MAINTAINED ONE SEES A STRONGER POWER SEEKING A MEANS OF PUTTING AN END TO THE SENSELESS RAGING OF RESSENTIMENT AMONG THE WEAKER POWERS THAT STAND UNDER IT (WHETHER THEY BE GROUPS OR INDIVIDUALS)‚ÄÎPARTLY BY TAKING THE OBJECT OF RESSENTIMENT OUT OF THE HANDS OF REVENGE, PARTLY BY SUBSTITUTING FOR REVENGE THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE ENEMIES OF PEACE AND ORDER, PARTLY BY DEVISING AND IN SOME CASES IMPOSING SETTLEMENTS, PARTLY BY ELEVATING CERTAIN EQUIVALENTS FOR INJURIES INTO NORMS TO WHICH FROM THEN ON RESSENTIMENT IS ONCE AND FOR ALL DIRECTED. THE MOST DECISIVE ACT, HOWEVER, THAT THE SUPREME POWER PERFORMS AND ACCOMPLISHES AGAINST THE PREDOMINANCE OF GRUDGES AND RANCOR‚ÄÎIT ALWAYS TAKES THIS ACTION AS SOON AS IT IS IN ANY WAY STRONG ENOUGH TO DO SO‚ÄÎIS THE INSTITUTION OF LAW,5 THE IMPERATIVE DECLARATION OF WHAT IN GENERAL COUNTS AS PERMITTED, AS JUST,6 IN ITS EVES, AND WHAT COUNTS AS FORBIDDEN, AS UNJUST:7 ONCE IT HAS INSTITUTED THE LAW, IT TREATS VIOLENCE AND CAPRICIOUS ACTS ON THE PART OF INDIVIDUALS OR ENTIRE GROUPS AS OFFENSES AGAINST THE LAW, AS REBELLION AGAINST THE SUPREME POWER ITSELF, AND THUS LEADS THE FEELINGS OF ITS SUBJECTS AWAY FROM THE DIRECT INJURY CAUSED BY SUCH OFFENSES; AND IN THE LONG RUN IT THUS ATTAINS THE REVERSE OF THAT WHICH IS DESIRED BY ALL REVENGE THAT IS FASTENED EXCLUSIVELY TO THE VIEWPOINT OF THE PERSON INJURED: FROM NOW ON THE EYE IS TRAINED TO AN EVER MORE IMPERSONAL EVALUATION OF THE DEED, AND THIS APPLIES EVEN TO THE EYE OF THE INJURED PERSON HIMSELF (ALTHOUGH LAST OF ALL, AS REMARKED ABOVE).

‚ÄÚJUST‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚUNJUST‚ÄÙ EXIST, ACCORDINGLY, ONLY AFTER THE INSTITUTION OF THE LAW (AND NOT, AS D√ºHRING WOULD HAVE IT, AFTER THE PERPETRATION OF THE INJURY). TO SPEAK OF JUST OR UNJUST IN ITSELF IS QUITE SENSELESS; IN ITSELF, OF COURSE, NO INJURY, ASSAULT, EXPLOITATION, DESTRUCTION CAN BE ‚ÄÚUNJUST,‚ÄÙ SINCE LIFE OPERATES ESSENTIALLY, THAT IS IN ITS BASIC FUNCTIONS, THROUGH INJURY, ASSAULT, EXPLOITATION, DESTRUCTION AND SIMPLY CANNOT BE THOUGHT OF AT ALL WITHOUT THIS CHARACTER. ONE MUST INDEED GRANT SOMETHING EVEN MORE UNPALATABLE: THAT, FROM THE HIGHEST BIOLOGICAL STANDPOINT, LEGAL CONDITIONS CAN NEVER BE OTHER THAN EXCEPTIONAL CONDITIONS, SINCE THEY CONSTITUTE A PARTIAL RESTRICTION OF THE WILL OF LIFE, WHICH IS BENT UPON POWER, AND ARE SUBORDINATE TO ITS TOTAL GOAL AS A SINGLE MEANS: NAMELY, AS A MEANS OF CREATING GREATER UNITS OF POWER. A LEGAL ORDER THOUGHT OF AS SOVEREIGN AND UNIVERSAL, NOT AS A MEANS IN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN POWER-COMPLEXES BUT AS A MEANS OF PREVENTING ALL STRUGGLE IN GENERAL‚ÄÎPERHAPS AFTER THE COMMUNISTIC CLICH√© OF D√ºHRING, THAT EVERY WILL MUST CONSIDER EVERY OTHER WILL ITS EQUAL‚ÄÎWOULD BE A PRINCIPLE HOSTILE TO LIFE, AN AGENT OF THE DISSOLUTION AND DESTRUCTION OF MAN, AN ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE THE FUTURE OF MAN, A SIGN OF WEARINESS, A SECRET PATH TO NOTHINGNESS.‚ÄÎ

YET A WORD ON THE ORIGIN AND THE PURPOSE OF PUNISHMENT‚ÄÎTWO PROBLEMS THAT ARE SEPARATE, OR OUGHT TO BE SEPARATE: UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ARE USUALLY CONFOUNDED. HOW HAVE PREVIOUS GENEALOGISTS OF MORALS SET ABOUT SOLVING THESE PROBLEMS? NA√ØVELY, AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THEIR WAY: THEY SEEK OUT SOME ‚ÄÚPURPOSE‚ÄÙ IN PUNISHMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, REVENGE OR DETERRENCE, THEN GUILELESSLY PLACE THIS PURPOSE AT THE BEGINNING AS CAUSA FIENDI1 OF PUNISHMENT, AND‚ÄÎHAVE DONE. THE ‚ÄÚPURPOSE OF LAW,‚ÄÙ HOWEVER, IS ABSOLUTELY THE LAST THING TO EMPLOY IN THE HISTORY OF THE ORIGIN OF LAW: ON THE CONTRARY, THERE IS FOR HISTORIOGRAPHY OF ANY KIND NO MORE IMPORTANT PROPOSITION THAN THE ONE IT TOOK SUCH EFFORT TO ESTABLISH BUT WHICH REALLY OUGHT TO BE ESTABLISHED NOW: THE CAUSE OF THE ORIGIN OF A THING AND ITS EVENTUAL UTILITY, ITS ACTUAL EMPLOYMENT AND PLACE IN A SYSTEM OF PURPOSES, LIE WORLDS APART; WHATEVER EXISTS, HAVING SOMEHOW COME INTO BEING, IS AGAIN AND AGAIN REINTERPRETED TO NEW ENDS, TAKEN OVER, TRANSFORMED, AND REDIRECTED BY SOME POWER SUPERIOR TO IT; ALL EVENTS IN THE ORGANIC WORLD ARE A SUBDUING, A BECOMING MASTER, AND ALL SUBDUING AND BECOMING MASTER INVOLVES A FRESH INTERPRETATION, AN ADAPTATION THROUGH WHICH ANY PREVIOUS ‚ÄÚMEANING‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚPURPOSE‚ÄÙ ARE NECESSARILY OBSCURED OR EVEN OBLITERATED. HOWEVER WELL ONE HAS UNDERSTOOD THE UTILITY OF ANY PHYSIOLOGICAL ORGAN (OR OF A LEGAL INSTITUTION, A SOCIAL CUSTOM, A POLITICAL USAGE, A FORM IN ART OR IN A RELIGIOUS CULT), THIS MEANS NOTHING REGARDING ITS ORIGIN: HOWEVER UNCOMFORTABLE AND DISAGREEABLE THIS MAY SOUND TO OLDER EARS‚ÄÎFOR ONE HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT TO UNDERSTAND THE DEMONSTRABLE PURPOSE, THE UTILITY OF A THING, A FORM, OR AN INSTITUTION, WAS ALSO TO UNDERSTAND THE REASON WHY IT ORIGINATED‚ÄÎTHE EYE BEING MADE FOR SEEING, THE HAND BEING MADE FOR GRASPING.

THUS ONE ALSO IMAGINED THAT PUNISHMENT WAS DEVISED FOR PUNISHING. BUT PURPOSES AND UTILITIES ARE ONLY SIGNS THAT A WILL TO POWER HAS BECOME MASTER OF SOMETHING LESS POWERFUL AND IMPOSED UPON IT THE CHARACTER OF A FUNCTION; AND THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF A ‚ÄÚTHING,‚ÄÙ AN ORGAN, A CUSTOM CAN IN THIS WAY BE A CONTINUOUS SIGN-CHAIN OF EVER NEW INTERPRETATIONS AND ADAPTATIONS WHOSE CAUSES DO NOT EVEN HAVE TO BE RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER BUT, ON THE CONTRARY, IN SOME CASES SUCCEED AND ALTERNATE WITH ONE ANOTHER IN A PURELY CHANCE FASHION. THE ‚ÄÚEVOLUTION‚ÄÙ OF A THING, A CUSTOM, AN ORGAN IS THUS BY NO MEANS ITS PROGRESSUS TOWARD A GOAL, EVEN LESS A LOGICAL PROGRESSUS BY THE SHORTEST ROUTE AND WITH THE SMALLEST EXPENDITURE OF FORCE‚ÄÎBUT A SUCCESSION OF MORE OR LESS PROFOUND, MORE OR LESS MUTUALLY INDEPENDENT PROCESSES OF SUBDUING, PLUS THE RESISTANCES THEY ENCOUNTER, THE ATTEMPTS AT TRANSFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEFENSE AND REACTION, AND THE RESULTS OF SUCCESSFUL COUNTERACTIONS. THE FORM IS FLUID, BUT THE ‚ÄÚMEANING‚ÄÙ IS EVEN MORE SO.

THE CASE IS THE SAME EVEN WITHIN EACH INDIVIDUAL ORGANISM: WITH EVERY REAL GROWTH IN THE WHOLE, THE ‚ÄÚMEANING‚ÄÙ OF THE INDIVIDUAL ORGANS ALSO CHANGES; IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THEIR PARTIAL DESTRUCTION, A REDUCTION IN THEIR NUMBERS (FOR EXAMPLE, THROUGH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF INTERMEDIARY MEMBERS) CAN BE A SIGN OF INCREASING STRENGTH AND PERFECTION. IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT EVEN A PARTIAL DIMINUTION OF UTILITY, AN ATROPHYING AND DEGENERATION, A LOSS OF MEANING AND PURPOSIVENESS‚ÄÎIN SHORT, DEATH‚ÄÎIS AMONG THE CONDITIONS OF AN ACTUAL PROGRESSUS, WHICH ALWAYS APPEARS IN THE SHAPE OF A WILL AND WAY TO GREATER POWER AND IS ALWAYS CARRIED THROUGH AT THE EXPENSE OF NUMEROUS SMALLER POWERS. THE MAGNITUDE OF AN ‚ÄÚADVANCE‚ÄÙ CAN EVEN BE MEASURED BY THE MASS OF THINGS THAT HAD TO BE SACRIFICED TO IT; MANKIND IN THE MASS SACRIFICED TO THE PROSPERITY OF A SINGLE STRONGER SPECIES OF MAN‚ÄÎTHAT WOULD BE AN ADVANCE.

I EMPHASIZE THIS MAJOR POINT OF HISTORICAL METHOD ALL THE MORE BECAUSE IT IS IN FUNDAMENTAL OPPOSITION TO THE NOW PREVALENT INSTINCT AND TASTE WHICH WOULD RATHER BE RECONCILED EVEN TO THE ABSOLUTE FORTUITOUSNESS, EVEN THE MECHANISTIC SENSELESSNESS OF ALL EVENTS THAN TO THE THEORY THAT IN ALL EVENTS A WILL TO POWER IS OPERATING. THE DEMOCRATIC IDIOSYNCRACY WHICH OPPOSES EVERYTHING THAT DOMINATES AND WANTS TO DOMINATE, THE MODERN MISARCHISM2 (TO COIN AN UGLY WORD FOR AN UGLY THING) HAS PERMEATED THE REALM OF THE SPIRIT AND DISGUISED ITSELF IN THE MOST SPIRITUAL FORMS TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT TODAY IT HAS FORCED ITS WAY, HAS ACQUIRED THE RIGHT TO FORCE ITS WAY INTO THE STRICTEST, APPARENTLY MOST OBJECTIVE SCIENCES; INDEED, IT SEEMS TO ME TO HAVE ALREADY TAKEN CHARGE OF ALL PHYSIOLOGY AND THEORY OF LIFE‚ÄÎTO THE DETRIMENT OF LIFE, AS GOES WITHOUT SAYING, SINCE IT HAS ROBBED IT OF A FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT, THAT OF ACTIVITY. UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED IDIOSYNCRACY, ONE PLACES INSTEAD ‚ÄÚADAPTATION‚ÄÙ IN THE FOREGROUND, THAT IS TO SAY, AN ACTIVITY OF THE SECOND RANK, A MERE REACTIVITY; INDEED, LIFE ITSELF HAS BEEN DEFINED AS A MORE AND MORE EFFICIENT INNER ADAPTATION TO EXTERNAL CONDITIONS (HERBERT SPENCER3). THUS THE ESSENCE OF LIFE, ITS WILL TO POWER, IS IGNORED; ONE OVERLOOKS THE ESSENTIAL PRIORITY OF THE SPONTANEOUS, AGGRESSIVE, EXPANSIVE, FORM-GIVING FORCES THAT GIVE NEW INTERPRETATIONS AND DIRECTIONS, ALTHOUGH ‚ÄÚADAPTATION‚ÄÙ FOLLOWS ONLY AFTER THIS; THE DOMINANT ROLE OF THE HIGHEST FUNCTIONARIES WITHIN THE ORGANISM ITSELF IN WHICH THE WILL TO LIFE APPEARS ACTIVE AND FORM-GIVING IS DENIED. ONE SHOULD RECALL WHAT HUXLEY4 REPROACHED SPENCER WITH‚ÄÎHIS ‚ÄÚADMINISTRATIVE NIHILISM‚ÄÙ: BUT IT IS A QUESTION OF RATHER MORE THAN MERE ‚ÄÚADMINISTRATION.‚ÄÙ

TO RETURN TO OUR SUBJECT, NAMELY PUNISHMENT, ONE MUST DISTINGUISH TWO ASPECTS: ON THE ONE HAND, THAT IN IT WHICH IS RELATIVELY ENDURING, THE CUSTOM, THE ACT, THE ‚ÄÚDRAMA,‚ÄÙ A CERTAIN STRICT SEQUENCE OF PROCEDURES; ON THE OTHER, THAT IN IT WHICH IS FLUID, THE MEANING, THE PURPOSE, THE EXPECTATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH PROCEDURES. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED MAJOR POINT OF HISTORICAL METHOD, IT IS ASSUMED WITHOUT FURTHER ADO THAT THE PROCEDURE ITSELF WILL BE SOMETHING OLDER, EARLIER THAN ITS EMPLOYMENT IN PUNISHMENT, THAT THE LATTER IS PROJECTED AND INTERPRETED INTO THE PROCEDURE (WHICH HAS LONG EXISTED BUT BEEN EMPLOYED IN ANOTHER SENSE), IN SHORT, THAT THE CASE IS NOT AS HAS HITHERTO BEEN ASSUMED BY OUR NA√ØVE GENEALOGISTS OF LAW AND MORALS, WHO HAVE ONE AND ALL THOUGHT OF THE PROCEDURE AS INVENTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PUNISHING, JUST AS ONE FORMERLY THOUGHT OF THE HAND AS INVENTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF GRASPING.

AS FOR THE OTHER ELEMENT IN PUNISHMENT, THE FLUID ELEMENT, ITS ‚ÄÚMEANING,‚ÄÙ IN A VERY LATE CONDITION OF CULTURE (FOR EXAMPLE, IN MODERN EUROPE) THE CONCEPT ‚ÄÚPUNISHMENT‚ÄÙ POSSESSES IN FACT NOT ONE MEANING BUT A WHOLE SYNTHESIS OF ‚ÄÚMEANINGS‚ÄÙ: THE PREVIOUS HISTORY OF PUNISHMENT IN GENERAL, THE HISTORY OF ITS EMPLOYMENT FOR THE MOST VARIOUS PURPOSES, FINALLY CRYSTALLIZES INTO A KIND OF UNITY THAT IS HARD TO DISENTANGLE, HARD TO ANALYZE AND, AS MUST BE EMPHASIZED ESPECIALLY, TOTALLY INDEFINABLE. (TODAY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FOR CERTAIN WHY PEOPLE ARE REALLY PUNISHED: ALL CONCEPTS IN WHICH AN ENTIRE PROCESS IS SEMIOTICALLY CONCENTRATED ELUDE DEFINITION; ONLY THAT WHICH HAS NO HISTORY IS DEFINABLE.1) AT AN EARLIER STAGE, ON THE CONTRARY, THIS SYNTHESIS OF ‚ÄÚMEANINGS‚ÄÙ CAN STILL BE DISENTANGLED, AS WELL AS CHANGED; ONE CAN STILL PERCEIVE HOW IN EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE THE ELEMENTS OF THE SYNTHESIS UNDERGO A SHIFT IN VALUE AND REARRANGE THEMSELVES ACCORDINGLY, SO THAT NOW THIS, NOW THAT ELEMENT COMES TO THE FORE AND DOMINATES AT THE EXPENSE OF THE OTHERS; AND UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES ONE ELEMENT (THE PURPOSE OF DETERRENCE PERHAPS) APPEARS TO OVERCOME ALL THE REMAINING ELEMENTS.

TO GIVE AT LEAST AN IDEA OF HOW UNCERTAIN, HOW SUPPLEMENTAL, HOW ACCIDENTAL ‚ÄÚTHE MEANING‚ÄÙ OF PUNISHMENT IS, AND HOW ONE AND THE SAME PROCEDURE CAN BE EMPLOYED, INTERPRETED, ADAPTED TO ENDS THAT DIFFER FUNDAMENTALLY, I SET DOWN HERE THE PATTERN THAT HAS EMERGED FROM CONSIDERATION OF RELATIVELY FEW CHANCE INSTANCES I HAVE NOTED. PUNISHMENT AS A MEANS OF RENDERING HARMLESS, OF PREVENTING FURTHER HARM. PUNISHMENT AS RECOMPENSE TO THE INJURED PARTY FOR THE HARM DONE, RENDERED IN ANY FORM (EVEN IN THAT OF A COMPENSATING AFFECT). PUNISHMENT AS THE ISOLATION OF A DISTURBANCE OF EQUILIBRIUM, SO AS TO GUARD AGAINST ANY FURTHER SPREAD OF THE DISTURBANCE. PUNISHMENT AS A MEANS OF INSPIRING FEAR OF THOSE WHO DETERMINE AND EXECUTE THE PUNISHMENT. PUNISHMENT AS A KIND OF REPAYMENT FOR THE ADVANTAGES THE CRIMINAL HAS ENJOYED HITHERTO (FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN HE IS EMPLOYED AS A SLAVE IN THE MINES). PUNISHMENT AS THE EXPULSION OF A DEGENERATE ELEMENT (IN SOME CASES, OF AN ENTIRE BRANCH, AS IN CHINESE LAW: THUS AS A MEANS OF PRESERVING THE PURITY OF A RACE OR MAINTAINING A SOCIAL TYPE). PUNISHMENT AS A FESTIVAL, NAMELY AS THE RAPE AND MOCKERY OF A FINALLY DEFEATED ENEMY. PUNISHMENT AS THE MAKING OF A MEMORY, WHETHER FOR HIM WHO SUFFERS THE PUNISHMENT‚ÄÎSO-CALLED ‚ÄÚIMPROVEMENT‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎOR FOR THOSE WHO WITNESS ITS EXECUTION. PUNISHMENT AS PAYMENT OF A FEE STIPULATED BY THE POWER THAT PROTECTS THE WRONGDOER FROM THE EXCESSES OF REVENGE. PUNISHMENT AS A COMPROMISE WITH REVENGE IN ITS NATURAL STATE WHEN THE LATTER IS STILL MAINTAINED AND CLAIMED AS A PRIVILEGE BY POWERFUL CLANS. PUNISHMENT AS A DECLARATION OF WAR AND A WAR MEASURE AGAINST AN ENEMY OF PEACE, OF THE LAW, OF ORDER, OF THE AUTHORITIES, WHOM, AS A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY, AS ONE WHO HAS BROKEN THE CONTRACT THAT DEFINES THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH IT EXISTS, AS A REBEL, A TRAITOR, AND BREAKER OF THE PEACE, ONE OPPOSES WITH THE MEANS OF WAR.‚ÄÎ





14


THIS LIST IS CERTAINLY NOT COMPLETE; IT IS CLEAR THAT PUNISHMENT IS OVERDETERMINED1 BY UTILITIES OF ALL KINDS. ALL THE MORE REASON, THEN, FOR DEDUCTING FROM IT A SUPPOSED UTILITY THAT, TO BE SURE, COUNTS IN THE POPULAR CONSCIOUSNESS AS THE MOST ESSENTIAL ONE‚ÄÎBELIEF IN PUNISHMENT, WHICH FOR SEVERAL REASONS IS TOTTERING TODAY, ALWAYS FINDS ITS STRONGEST SUPPORT IN THIS. PUNISHMENT IS SUPPOSED TO POSSESS THE VALUE OF AWAKENING THE FEELING OF GUILT IN THE GUILTY PERSON; ONE SEEKS IN IT THE ACTUAL INSTRUMENTUM OF THAT PSYCHICAL REACTION CALLED ‚ÄÚBAD CONSCIENCE,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚSTING OF CONSCIENCE.‚ÄÙ THUS ONE MISUNDERSTANDS PSYCHOLOGY AND THE REALITY OF THINGS EVEN AS THEY APPLY TODAY: HOW MUCH MORE AS THEY APPLIED DURING THE GREATER PART OF MAN‚ÄÔS HISTORY, HIS PREHISTORY!

IT IS PRECISELY AMONG CRIMINALS AND CONVICTS THAT THE STING OF CONSCIENCE IS EXTREMELY RATE; PRISONS AND PENITENTIARIES ARE NOT THE KIND OF HOTBED IN WHICH THIS SPECIES OF GNAWING WORM IS LIKELY TO FLOURISH: ALL CONSCIENTIOUS OBSERVERS ARE AGREED ON THAT, IN MANY CASES UNWILLINGLY ENOUGH AND CONTRARY TO THEIR OWN INCLINATIONS. GENERALLY SPEAKING, PUNISHMENT MAKES MEN HARD AND COLD; IT CONCENTRATES; IT SHARPENS THE FEELING OF ALIENATION; IT STRENGTHENS THE POWER OF RESISTANCE. IF IT HAPPENS THAT PUNISHMENT DESTROYS THE VITAL ENERGY AND BRINGS ABOUT A MISERABLE PROSTRATION AND SELF-ABASEMENT, SUCH A RESULT IS CERTAINLY EVEN LESS PLEASANT THAN THE USUAL EFFECTS OF PUNISHMENT‚ÄÎCHARACTERIZED BY DRY AND GLOOMY SERIOUSNESS.

IF WE CONSIDER THOSE MILLENNIA BEFORE THE HISTORY OF MAN, WE MAY UNHESITATINGLY ASSERT THAT IT WAS PRECISELY THROUGH PUNISHMENT THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FEELING OF GUILT WAS MOST POWERFULLY HINDERED‚ÄÎAT LEAST IN THE VICTIMS UPON WHOM THE PUNITIVE FORCE WAS VENTED. FOR WE MUST NOT UNDERRATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE SIGHT OF THE JUDICIAL AND EXECUTIVE PROCEDURES PREVENTS THE CRIMINAL FROM CONSIDERING HIS DEED, THE TYPE OF HIS ACTION AS SUCH, REPREHENSIBLE: FOR HE SEES EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF ACTIONS PRACTICED IN THE SERVICE OF JUSTICE AND APPROVED OF AND PRACTICED WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE: SPYING, DECEPTION, BRIBERY, SETTING TRAPS, THE WHOLE CUNNING AND UNDERHAND ART OF POLICE AND PROSECUTION, PLUS ROBBERY, VIOLENCE, DEFAMATION, IMPRISONMENT, TORTURE, MURDER, PRACTICED AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE AND WITHOUT EVEN EMOTION TO EXCUSE THEM, WHICH ARE PRONOUNCED CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VARIOUS FORMS OF PUNISHMENT‚ÄÎALL OF THEM THEREFORE ACTIONS WHICH HIS JUDGES IN NO WAY CONDEMN AND REPUDIATE AS SUCH, BUT ONLY WHEN THEY ARE APPLIED AND DIRECTED TO CERTAIN PARTICULAR ENDS.

THE ‚ÄÚBAD CONSCIENCE,‚ÄÙ THIS MOST UNCANNY AND MOST INTERESTING PLANT OF ALL OUR EARTHLY VEGETATION, DID NOT GROW ON THIS SOIL; INDEED, DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE PAST THE JUDGES AND PUNISHERS THEMSELVES WERE NOT AT ALL CONSCIOUS OF DEALING WITH A ‚ÄÚGUILTY PERSON.‚ÄÙ BUT WITH AN INSTIGATOR OF HARM, WITH AN IRRESPONSIBLE PIECE OF FATE. AND THE PERSON UPON WHOM PUNISHMENT SUBSEQUENTLY DESCENDED, AGAIN LIKE A PIECE OF FATE, SUFFERED NO ‚ÄÚINWARD PAIN‚ÄÙ OTHER THAN THAT INDUCED BY THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF SOMETHING UNFORESEEN, A DREADFUL NATURAL EVENT, A PLUNGING, CRUSHING ROCK THAT ONE CANNOT FIGHT.





15


THIS FACT ONCE CAME INSIDIOUSLY INTO THE MIND OF SPINOZA (TO THE VEXATION OF HIS INTERPRETERS, KUNO FISCHER,1 FOR EXAMPLE, WHO MAKE A REAL EFFORT TO MISUNDERSTAND HIM ON THIS POINT), WHEN ONE AFTERNOON, TEASED BY WHO KNOWS WHAT RECOLLECTION, HE MUSED ON THE QUESTION OF WHAT REALLY REMAINED TO HIM OF THE FAMOUS MORSUS CONSCIENTIAE2‚ÄÎHE WHO HAD BANISHED GOOD AND EVIL TO THE REALM OF HUMAN IMAGINATION AND HAD WRATHFULLY DEFENDED THE HONOR OF HIS ‚ÄÚFREE‚ÄÙ GOD AGAINST THOSE BLASPHEMERS WHO ASSERTED THAT GOD EFFECTED ALL THINGS SUB RATIONE BON? (‚ÄÚBUT THAT WOULD MEAN MAKING GOD SUBJECT TO FATE AND WOULD SURELY BE THE GREATEST OF ALL ABSURDITIES‚ÄÙ). THE WORLD, FOR SPINOZA, HAD RETURNED TO THAT STATE OF INNOCENCE IN WHICH IT HAD LAIN BEFORE THE INVENTION OF THE BAD CONSCIENCE: WHAT THEN HAD BECOME OF THE MORSUS CONSCIENTIAE?

‚ÄÚTHE OPPOSITE OF GAUDIUM,‚ÄÙ4 HE FINALLY SAID TO HIMSELF‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚA SADNESS ACCOMPANIED BY THE RECOLLECTION OF A PAST EVENT THAT FLOUTED ALL OF OUR EXPECTATIONS.‚ÄÙ ETH. III, PROPOS. XVIII, SCHOL. I. II. MISCHIEF-MAKERS OVERTAKEN BY PUNISHMENTS HAVE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS FELT IN RESPECT OF THEIR ‚ÄÚTRANSGRESSIONS‚ÄÙ JUST AS SPINOZA DID: ‚ÄÚHERE SOMETHING HAS UNEXPECTEDLY GONE WRONG,‚ÄÙ NOT: ‚ÄÚI OUGHT NOT TO HAVE DONE THAT.‚ÄÙ THEY SUBMITTED TO PUNISHMENT AS ONE SUBMITS TO AN ILLNESS OR TO A MISFORTUNE OR TO DEATH, WITH THAT STOUT-HEARTED FATALISM WITHOUT REBELLION THROUGH WHICH THE RUSSIANS, FOR EXAMPLE, STILL HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER US WESTERNERS IN DEALING WITH LIFE.

IF THERE EXISTED ANY CRITICISM OF THE DEED IN THOSE DAYS, IT WAS PRUDENCE THAT CRITICIZED THE DEED: THE ACTUAL EFFECT OF PUNISHMENT MUST BEYOND QUESTION BE SOUGHT ABOVE ALL IN A HEIGHTENING OF PRUDENCE, IN AN EXTENDING OF THE MEMORY, IN A WILL HENCEFORTH TO GO TO WORK MORE CAUTIOUSLY, MISTRUSTFULLY, SECRETLY, IN THE INSIGHT THAT ONE IS DEFINITELY TOO WEAK FOR MANY THINGS, IN A KIND OF IMPROVEMENT IN SELF-CRITICISM. THAT WHICH CAN IN GENERAL BE ATTAINED THROUGH PUNISHMENT, IN MEN AND IN ANIMALS, IS AN INCREASE OF FEAR, A HEIGHTENING OF PRUDENCE, MASTERY OF THE DESIRES: THUS PUNISHMENT TAMES MEN, BUT IT DOES NOT MAKE THEM ‚ÄÚBETTER‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎONE MIGHT WITH MORE JUSTICE ASSERT THE OPPOSITE. (‚ÄÚINJURY MAKES ONE PRUDENT,‚ÄÙ SAYS THE PROVERB: INSOFAR AS IT MAKES ONE PRUDENT IT ALSO MAKES ONE BAD. FORTUNATELY, IT FREQUENTLY MAKES PEOPLE STUPID.)

AT THIS POINT I CAN NO LONGER AVOID GIVING A FIRST, PROVISIONAL STATEMENT OF MY OWN HYPOTHESIS CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF THE ‚ÄÚBAD CONSCIENCE‚ÄÙ: IT MAY SOUND RATHER STRANGE AND NEEDS TO BE PONDERED, LIVED WITH, AND SLEPT ON FOR A LONG TIME. I REGARD THE BAD CONSCIENCE AS THE SERIOUS ILLNESS THAT MAN WAS BOUND TO CONTRACT UNDER THE STRESS OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE HE EVER EXPERIENCED‚ÄÎTHAT CHANGE WHICH OCCURRED WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF FINALLY ENCLOSED WITHIN THE WALLS OF SOCIETY AND OF PEACE. THE SITUATION THAT FACED SEA ANIMALS WHEN THEY WERE COMPELLED TO BECOME LAND ANIMALS OR PERISH WAS THE SAME AS THAT WHICH FACED THESE SEMI-ANIMALS, WELL ADAPTED TO THE WILDERNESS, TO WAR, TO PROWLING, TO ADVENTURE: SUDDENLY ALL THEIR INSTINCTS WERE DISVALUED AND ‚ÄÚSUSPENDED.‚ÄÙ FROM NOW ON THEY HAD TO WALK ON THEIR FEET AND ‚ÄÚBEAR THEMSELVES‚ÄÙ WHEREAS HITHERTO THEY HAD BEEN BORNE BY THE WATER: A DREADFUL HEAVINESS LAY UPON THEM. THEY FELT UNABLE TO COPE WITH THE SIMPLEST UNDERTAKINGS; IN THIS NEW WORLD THEY NO LONGER POSSESSED THEIR FORMER GUIDES, THEIR REGULATING, UNCONSCIOUS AND INFALLIBLE DRIVES: THEY WERE REDUCED TO THINKING, INFERRING, RECKONING, CO-ORDINATING CAUSE AND EFFECT, THESE UNFORTUNATE CREATURES; THEY WERE REDUCED TO THEIR ‚ÄÚCONSCIOUSNESS,‚ÄÙ THEIR WEAKEST AND MOST FALLIBLE ORGAN! I BELIEVE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SUCH A FEELING OF MISERY ON EARTH, SUCH A LEADEN DISCOMFORT‚ÄÎAND AT THE SAME TIME THE OLD INSTINCTS HAD NOT SUDDENLY CEASED TO MAKE THEIR USUAL DEMANDS! ONLY IT WAS HARDLY OR RARELY POSSIBLE TO HUMOR THEM: AS A RULE THEY HAD TO SEEK NEW AND, AS IT WERE, SUBTERRANEAN GRATIFICATIONS.

ALL INSTINCTS THAT DO NOT DISCHARGE THEMSELVES OUTWARDLY TURN INWARD‚ÄÎTHIS IS WHAT I CALL THE INTERNALIZATION1 OF MAN: THUS IT WAS THAT MAN FIRST DEVELOPED WHAT WAS LATER CALLED HIS ‚ÄÚSOUL.‚ÄÙ THE ENTIRE INNER WORLD, ORIGINALLY AS THIN AS IF IT WERE STRETCHED BETWEEN TWO MEMBRANES, EXPANDED AND EXTENDED ITSELF, ACQUIRED DEPTH, BREADTH, AND HEIGHT, IN THE SAME MEASURE AS OUTWARD DISCHARGE WAS INHIBITED. THOSE FEARFUL BULWARKS WITH WHICH THE POLITICAL ORGANIZATION PROTECTED ITSELF AGAINST THE OLD INSTINCTS OF FREEDOM‚ÄÎPUNISHMENTS BELONG AMONG THESE BULWARKS‚ÄÎBROUGHT ABOUT THAT ALL THOSE INSTINCTS OF WILD, FREE, PROWLING MAN TURNED BACKWARD AGAINST MAN HIMSELF. HOSTILITY, CRUELTY, JOY IN PERSECUTING, IN ATTACKING, IN CHANGE, IN DESTRUCTION‚ÄÎALL THIS TURNED AGAINST THE POSSESSORS OF SUCH INSTINCTS: THAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THE ‚ÄÚBAD CONSCIENCE.‚ÄÙ

THE MAN WHO, FROM LACK OF EXTERNAL ENEMIES AND RESISTANCES AND FORCIBLY CONFINED TO THE OPPRESSIVE NARROWNESS AND PUNCTILIOUSNESS OF CUSTOM, IMPATIENTLY LACERATED, PERSECUTED, GNAWED AT, ASSAULTED, AND MALTREATED HIMSELF; THIS ANIMAL THAT RUBBED ITSELF RAW AGAINST THE BARS OF ITS CAGE AS ONE TRIED TO ‚ÄÚTAME‚ÄÙ IT; THIS DEPRIVED CREATURE, RACKED WITH HOMESICKNESS FOR THE WILD, WHO HAD TO TURN HIMSELF INTO AN ADVENTURE, A TORTURE CHAMBER, AN UNCERTAIN AND DANGEROUS WILDERNESS‚ÄÎTHIS FOOL, THIS YEARNING AND DESPERATE PRISONER BECAME THE INVENTOR OF THE ‚ÄÚBAD CONSCIENCE.‚ÄÙ BUT THUS BEGAN THE GRAVEST AND UNCANNIEST ILLNESS, FROM WHICH HUMANITY HAS NOT YET RECOVERED, MAN‚ÄÔS SUFFERING OF MAN, OF HIMSELF‚ÄÎTHE RESULT OF A FORCIBLE SUNDERING FROM HIS ANIMAL PAST, AS IT WERE A LEAP AND PLUNGE INTO NEW SURROUNDINGS AND CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE, A DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST THE OLD INSTINCTS UPON WHICH HIS STRENGTH, JOY, AND TERRIBLENESS HAD RESTED HITHERTO.

LET US ADD AT ONCE THAT, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE EXISTENCE ON EARTH OF AN ANIMAL SOUL TURNED AGAINST ITSELF, TAKING SIDES AGAINST ITSELF, WAS SOMETHING SO NEW, PROFOUND, UNHEARD OF, ENIGMATIC, CONTRADICTORY, AND PREGNANT WITH A FUTURE THAT THE ASPECT OF THE EARTH WAS ESSENTIALLY ALTERED. INDEED, DIVINE SPECTATORS WERE NEEDED TO DO JUSTICE TO THE SPECTACLE THAT THUS BEGAN AND THE END OF WHICH IS NOT YET IN SIGHT‚ÄÎA SPECTACLE TOO SUBTLE, TOO MARVELOUS, TOO PARADOXICAL TO BE PLAYED SENSELESSLY UNOBSERVED ON SOME LUDICROUS PLANET! FROM NOW ON, MAN IS INCLUDED AMONG THE MOST UNEXPECTED AND EXCITING LUCKY THROWS IN THE DICE GAME OF HERACLITUS‚ÄÔ ‚ÄÚGREAT CHILD,‚ÄÙ BE HE CALLED ZEUS OR CHANCE; HE GIVES RISE TO AN INTEREST, A TENSION, A HOPE, ALMOST A CERTAINTY, AS IF WITH HIM SOMETHING WERE ANNOUNCING AND PREPARING ITSELF, AS IF MAN WERE NOT A GOAL BUT ONLY A WAY, AN EPISODE, A BRIDGE, A GREAT PROMISE.‚ÄÎ

AMONG THE PRESUPPOSITIONS OF THIS HYPOTHESIS CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF THE BAD CONSCIENCE IS, FIRST, THAT THE CHANGE REFERRED TO WAS NOT A GRADUAL OR VOLUNTARY ONE AND DID NOT REPRESENT AN ORGANIC ADAPTATION TO NEW CONDITIONS BUT A BREAK, A LEAP, A COMPULSION, AN INELUCTABLE DISASTER WHICH PRECLUDED ALL STRUGGLE AND EVEN ALL RES-SENTIMENT. SECONDLY, HOWEVER, THAT THE WELDING OF A HITHERTO UNCHECKED AND SHAPELESS POPULACE INTO A FIRM FORM WAS NOT ONLY INSTITUTED BY AN ACT OF VIOLENCE BUT ALSO CARRIED TO ITS CONCLUSION BY NOTHING BUT ACTS OF VIOLENCE‚ÄÎTHAT THE OLDEST ‚ÄÚSTATE‚ÄÙ THUS APPEARED AS A FEARFUL TYRANNY, AS AN OPPRESSIVE AND REMORSELESS MACHINE, AND WENT ON WORKING UNTIL THIS RAW MATERIAL OF PEOPLE AND SEMI-ANIMALS WAS AT LAST NOT ONLY THOROUGHLY KNEADED AND PLIANT BUT ALSO FORMED.

I EMPLOYED THE WORD ‚ÄÚSTATE‚ÄÙ: IT IS OBVIOUS WHAT IS MEANT‚ÄÎSOME PACK OF BLOND BEASTS OF PREY,1 A CONQUEROR AND MASTER RACE WHICH, ORGANIZED FOR WAR AND WITH THE ABILITY TO ORGANIZE, UNHESITATINGLY LAYS ITS TERRIBLE CLAWS UPON A POPULACE PERHAPS TREMENDOUSLY SUPERIOR IN NUMBERS BUT STILL FORMLESS AND NOMAD. THAT IS AFTER ALL HOW THE ‚ÄÚSTATE‚ÄÙ BEGAN ON EARTH: I THINK THAT SERITIMENTALISM WHICH WOULD HAVE IT BEGIN WITH A ‚ÄÚCONTRACT‚ÄÙ HAS BEEN DISPOSED OF. HE WHO CAN COMMAND, HE WHO IS BY NATURE ‚ÄÚMASTER,‚ÄÙ HE WHO IS VIOLENT IN ACT AND BEARING‚ÄÎWHAT HAS HE TO DO WITH CONTRACTS! ONE DOES NOT RECKON WITH SUCH NATURES; THEY COME LIKE FATE, WITHOUT REASON, CONSIDERATION, OR PRETEXT; THEY APPEAR AS LIGHTNING APPEARS, TOO TERRIBLE, TOO SUDDEN, TOO CONVINCING, TOO ‚ÄÚDIFFERENT‚ÄÙ EVEN TO BE HATED. THEIR WORK IS AN INSTINCTIVE CREATION AND IMPOSITION OF FORMS; THEY ARE THE MOST INVOLUNTARY, UNCONSCIOUS ARTISTS THERE ARE‚ÄÎWHEREVER THEY APPEAR SOMETHING NEW SOON ARISES, A RULING STRUCTURE THAT LIVES, IN WHICH PARTS AND FUNCTIONS ARE DELIMITED AND COORDINATED, IN WHICH NOTHING WHATEVER FINDS A PLACE THAT HAS NOT FIRST BEEN ASSIGNED A ‚ÄÚMEANING‚ÄÙ IN RELATION TO THE WHOLE. THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT GUILT, RESPONSIBILITY, OR CONSIDERATION ARE, THESE BORN ORGANIZERS; THEY EXEMPLIFY THAT TERRIBLE ARTISTS‚ÄÔ EGOISM THAT HAS THE LOOK OF BRONZE AND KNOWS ITSELF JUSTIFIED TO ALL ETERNITY IN ITS ‚ÄÚWORK,‚ÄÙ LIKE A MOTHER IN HER CHILD. IT IS NOT IN THEM THAT THE ‚ÄÚBAD CONSCIENCE‚ÄÙ DEVELOPED, THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING‚ÄÎBUT IT WOULD NOT HAVE DEVELOPED WITHOUT THEM, THIS UGLY GROWTH, IT WOULD BE LACKING IF A TREMENDOUS QUANTITY OF FREEDOM HAD NOT BEEN EXPELLED FROM THE WORLD, OR AT LEAST FROM THE VISIBLE WORLD, AND MADE AS IT WERE LATENT UNDER THEIR HAMMER BLOWS AND ARTISTS‚ÄÔ VIOLENCE. THIS INSTINCT FOR FREEDOM FORCIBLY MADE LATENT‚ÄÎWE HAVE SEEN IT ALREADY‚ÄÎTHIS INSTINCT FOR FREEDOM PUSHED BACK AND REPRESSED, INCARCERATED WITHIN AND FINALLY ABLE TO DISCHARGE AND VENT ITSELF ONLY ON ITSELF: THAT, AND THAT ALONE, IS WHAT THE BAD CONSCIENCE IS IN ITS BEGINNINGS.





18


ONE SHOULD GUARD AGAINST THINKING LIGHTLY OF THIS PHENOMENON MERELY ON ACCOUNT OF ITS INITIAL PAINFULNESS AND UGLINESS. FOR FUNDAMENTALLY IT IS THE SAME ACTIVE FORCE THAT IS AT WORK ON A GRANDER SCALE IN THOSE ARTISTS OF VIOLENCE AND ORGANIZERS WHO BUILD STATES, AND THAT HERE, INTERNALLY, ON A SMALLER AND PETTIER SCALE, DIRECTED BACKWARD, IN THE ‚ÄÚLABYRINTH OF THE BREAST,‚ÄÙ TO USE GOETHE‚ÄÔS EXPRESSION, CREATES FOR ITSELF A BAD CONSCIENCE AND BUILDS NEGATIVE IDEALS‚ÄÎNAMELY, THE INSTINCT FOR FREEDOM (IN MY LANGUAGE: THE WILL TO POWER); ONLY HERE THE MATERIAL UPON WHICH THE FORM-GIVING AND RAVISHING NATURE OF THIS FORCE VENTS ITSELF IS MAN HIMSELF, HIS WHOLE ANCIENT ANIMAL SELF‚ÄÎAND NOT, AS IN THAT GREATER AND MORE OBVIOUS PHENOMENON, SOME OTHER MAN, OTHER MEN. THIS SECRET SELF-RAVISHMENT, THIS ARTISTS‚ÄÔ CRUELTY, THIS DELIGHT IN IMPOSING A FORM UPON ONESELF AS A HARD, RECALCITRANT, SUFFERING MATERIAL AND IN BURNING A WILL, A CRITIQUE, A CONTRADICTION, A CONTEMPT, A NO INTO IT, THIS UNCANNY, DREADFULLY JOYOUS LABOR OF A SOUL VOLUNTARILY AT ODDS WITH ITSELF THAT MAKES ITSELF SUFFER OUT OF JOY IN MAKING SUFFER‚ÄÎEVENTUALLY THIS ENTIRE ACTIVE ‚ÄÚBAD CONSCIENCE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎYOU WILL HAVE GUESSED IT‚ÄÎAS THE WOMB OF ALL IDEAL AND IMAGINATIVE PHENOMENA, ALSO BROUGHT TO LIGHT AN ABUNDANCE OF STRANGE NEW BEAUTY AND AFFIRMATION, AND PERHAPS BEAUTY ITSELF.‚ÄÎAFTER ALL, WHAT WOULD BE ‚ÄÚBEAUTIFUL‚ÄÙ IF THE CONTRADICTION HAD NOT FIRST BECOME CONSCIOUS OF ITSELF, IF THE UGLY HAD NOT FIRST SAID TO ITSELF: ‚ÄÚI AM UGLY‚ÄÙ?

THIS HINT WILL AT LEAST MAKE LESS ENIGMATIC THE ENIGMA OF HOW CONTRADICTORY CONCEPTS SUCH AS SELFLESSNESS, SELF-DENIAL, SELF-SACRIFICE CAN SUGGEST AN IDEAL, A KIND OF BEAUTY; AND ONE THING WE KNOW HENCEFORTH‚ÄÎI HAVE NO DOUBT OF IT‚ÄÎAND THAT IS THE NATURE OF THE DELIGHT THAT THE SELFLESS MAN, THE SELF-DENIER, THE SELF-SACRIFICER FEELS FROM THE FIRST: THIS DELIGHT IS TIED TO CRUELTY.

SO MUCH FOR THE PRESENT ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF THE MORAL VALUE OF THE ‚ÄÚUNEGOISTIC,‚ÄÙ ABOUT THE SOIL FROM WHICH THIS VALUE GREW: ONLY THE BAD CONSCIENCE, ONLY THE WILL TO SELF-MALTREATMENT PROVIDED THE CONDITIONS FOR THE VALUE OF THE UNEGOISTIC.‚ÄÎ





19


THE BAD CONSCIENCE IS AN ILLNESS, THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT, BUT AN ILLNESS AS PREGNANCY IS AN ILLNESS.1 LET US SEEK OUT THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THIS ILLNESS HAS REACHED ITS MOST TERRIBLE AND MOST SUBLIME HEIGHT; WE SHALL SEE WHAT IT REALLY WAS THAT THUS ENTERED THE WORLD. BUT FOR THAT ONE NEEDS ENDURANCE‚ÄÎAND FIRST OF ALL WE MUST GO BACK AGAIN TO AN EARLIER POINT OF VIEW.

THE CIVIL-LAW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEBTOR AND HIS CREDITOR, DISCUSSED ABOVE, HAS BEEN INTERPRETED IN AN, HISTORICALLY SPEAKING, EXCEEDINGLY REMARKABLE AND DUBIOUS MANNER INTO A RELATIONSHIP IN WHICH TO US MODERN MEN IT SEEMS PERHAPS LEAST TO BELONG: NAMELY INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PRESENT GENERATION AND ITS ANCESTORS.

WITHIN THE ORIGINAL TRIBAL COMMUNITY‚ÄÎWE ARE SPEAKING OF PRIMEVAL TIMES‚ÄÎTHE LIVING GENERATION ALWAYS RECOGNIZED A JURIDICAL DUTY TOWARD EARLIER GENERATIONS, AND ESPECIALLY TOWARD THE EARLIEST, WHICH FOUNDED THE TRIBE (AND BY NO MEANS A MERELY SENTIMENTAL OBLIGATION: THERE ARE ACTUALLY REASONS FOR DENYING THE EXISTENCE OF THE LATTER FOR THE GREATER PART OF HUMAN HISTORY). THE CONVICTION REIGNS THAT IT IS ONLY THROUGH THE SACRIFICES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE ANCESTORS THAT THE TRIBE EXISTS‚ÄÎAND THAT ONE HAS TO PAY THEM BACK WITH SACRIFICES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS: ONE THUS RECOGNIZES A DEBT THAT CONSTANTLY GROWS GREATER, SINCE THESE FOREBEARS NEVER CEASE, IN THEIR CONTINUED EXISTENCE AS POWERFUL SPIRITS, TO ACCORD THE TRIBE NEW ADVANTAGES AND NEW STRENGTH. IN VAIN, PERHAPS? BUT THERE IS NO ‚ÄÚIN VAIN‚ÄÙ FOR THESE RUDE AND ‚ÄÚPOOR-SOULED‚ÄÙ AGES. WHAT CAN ONE GIVE THEM IN RETURN? SACRIFICES (INITIALLY AS FOOD IN THE COARSEST SENSE), FEASTS, MUSIC, HONORS; ABOVE ALL, OBEDIENCE‚ÄÎFOR ALL CUSTOMS, AS WORKS OF THE ANCESTORS, ARE ALSO THEIR STATUTES AND COMMANDS: CAN ONE EVER GIVE THEM ENOUGH? THIS SUSPICION REMAINS AND INCREASES; FROM TIME TO TIME IT LEADS TO A WHOLESALE SACRIFICE, SOMETHING TREMENDOUS IN THE WAY OF REPAYMENT TO THE ‚ÄÚCREDITOR‚ÄÙ (THE NOTORIOUS SACRIFICE OF THE FIRST-BORN, FOR EXAMPLE; IN ANY CASE BLOOD, HUMAN BLOOD).

THE FEAR OF THE ANCESTOR AND HIS POWER, THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF INDEBTEDNESS TO HIM, INCREASES, ACCORDING TO THIS KIND OF LOGIC, IN EXACTLY THE SAME MEASURE AS THE POWER OF THE TRIBE ITSELF INCREASES, AS THE TRIBE ITSELF GROWS EVER MORE VICTORIOUS, INDEPENDENT, HONORED, AND FEARED. BY NO MEANS THE OTHER WAY ROUND! EVERY STEP TOWARD THE DECLINE OF A TRIBE, EVERY MISFORTUNE, EVERY SIGN OF DEGENERATION, OF COMING DISINTEGRATION ALWAYS DIMINISHES FEAR OF THE SPIRIT OF ITS FOUNDER AND PRODUCES A MEANER IMPRESSION OF HIS CUNNING, FORESIGHT, AND PRESENT POWER. IF ONE IMAGINES THIS RUDE KIND OF LOGIC CARRIED TO ITS END, THEN THE ANCESTORS OF THE MOST POWERFUL TRIBES ARE BOUND EVENTUALLY TO GROW TO MONSTROUS DIMENSIONS THROUGH THE IMAGINATION OF GROWING FEAR AND TO RECEDE INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE DIVINELY UNCANNY AND UNIMAGINABLE: IN THE END THE ANCESTOR MUST NECESSARILY BE TRANSFIGURED INTO A GOD. PERHAPS THIS IS EVEN THE ORIGIN OF GODS, AN ORIGIN THEREFORE OUT OF FEAR!‚Ä¶ AND WHOEVER SHOULD FEEL OBLIGED TO ADD, ‚ÄÚBUT OUT OF PIETY ALSO!‚ÄÙ WOULD HARDLY BE RIGHT FOR THE GREATER PART OF THE EXISTENCE OF MAN, HIS PREHISTORY. TO BE SURE, HE WOULD BE QUITE RIGHT FOR THE INTERMEDIATE AGE, IN WHICH THE NOBLE TRIBES DEVELOPED‚ÄÎWHO INDEED PAID BACK THEIR ORIGINATORS, THEIR ANCESTORS (HEROES, GODS) WITH INTEREST ALL THE QUALITIES THAT HAD BECOME PALPABLE IN THEMSELVES, THE NOBLE QUALITIES. WE SHALL TAKE ANOTHER LOOK LATER AT THE ENNOBLEMENT OF THE GODS (WHICH SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH THEIR BECOMING ‚ÄÚHOLY‚ÄÙ); LET US FIRST OF ALL FOLLOW TO ITS END THE COURSE OF THIS WHOLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF GUILT.

HISTORY SHOWS THAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING IN DEBT1 TO THE DEITY DID NOT BY ANY MEANS COME TO AN END TOGETHER WITH THE ORGANIZATION OF COMMUNITIES ON THE BASIS OF BLOOD RELATIONSHIP. EVEN AS MANKIND INHERITED THE CONCEPTS ‚ÄÚGOOD AND BAD‚ÄÙ FROM THE TRIBAL NOBILITY (ALONG WITH ITS BASIC PSYCHOLOGICAL PROPENSITY TO SET UP ORDERS OF RANK), IT ALSO INHERITED, ALONG WITH THE TRIBAL AND FAMILY DIVINITIES, THE BURDEN OF STILL UNPAID DEBTS AND OF THE DESIRE TO BE RELIEVED OF THEM. (THE TRANSITION IS PROVIDED BY THOSE NUMEROUS SLAVE AND DEPENDENT POPULATIONS WHO, WHETHER THROUGH COMPULSION OR THROUGH SERVILITY AND MIMICRY, ADAPTED THEMSELVES TO THEIR MASTERS‚ÄÔ CULT OF THE GODS: THIS INHERITANCE THEN OVERFLOWS FROM THEM IN ALL DIRECTIONS.) THE GUILTY FEELING OF INDEBTEDNESS2 TO THE DIVINITY CONTINUED TO GROW FOR SEVERAL MILLENNIA‚ÄÎALWAYS IN THE SAME MEASURE AS THE CONCEPT OF GOD AND THE FEELING FOR DIVINITY INCREASED ON EARTH AND WAS CARRIED TO THE HEIGHTS. (THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF ETHNIC STRUGGLE, VICTORY, RECONCILIATION, FUSION, EVERYTHING THAT PRECEDES THE DEFINITIVE ORDERING OF RANK OF THE DIFFERENT NATIONAL ELEMENTS IN EVERY GREAT RACIAL SYNTHESIS, IS REFLECTED IN THE CONFUSED GENEALOGIES OF THEIR GODS, IN THE SAGAS OF THE GODS‚ÄÔ STRUGGLES, VICTORIES, AND RECONCILIATIONS; THE ADVANCE TOWARD UNIVERSAL EMPIRES IS ALWAYS ALSO AN ADVANCE TOWARD UNIVERSAL DIVINITIES; DESPOTISM WITH ITS TRIUMPH OVER THE INDEPENDENT NOBILITY ALWAYS PREPARES THE WAY FOR SOME KIND OF MONOTHEISM.)

THE ADVENT OF THE CHRISTIAN GOD, AS THE MAXIMUM GOD ATTAINED SO FAR, WAS THEREFORE ACCOMPANIED BY THE MAXIMUM FEELING OF GUILTY INDEBTEDNESS3 ON EARTH. PRESUMING WE HAVE GRADUALLY ENTERED UPON THE REVERSE COURSE, THERE IS NO SMALL PROBABILITY THAT WITH THE IRRESISTIBLE DECLINE OF FAITH IN THE CHRISTIAN GOD THERE IS NOW ALSO A CONSIDERABLE DECLINE IN MANKIND‚ÄÔS FEELING OF GUILT;4 INDEED, THE PROSPECT CANNOT BE DISMISSED THAT THE COMPLETE AND DEFINITIVE VICTORY OF ATHEISM MIGHT FREE MANKIND OF THIS WHOLE FEELING OF GUILTY INDEBTEDNESS5 TOWARD ITS ORIGIN, ITS CAUSA PRIMA.6 ATHEISM AND A KIND OF SECOND INNOCENCE1 BELONG TOGETHER.‚ÄÎ





21


SO MUCH FOR A FIRST BRIEF PRELIMINARY ON THE CONNECTION OF THE CONCEPTS ‚ÄÚGUILT‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚDUTY‚ÄÙ WITH RELIGIOUS PRESUPPOSITIONS: I HAVE UP TO NOW DELIBERATELY IGNORED THE MORALIZATION OF THESE CONCEPTS (THEIR PUSHING BACK INTO THE CONSCIENCE; MORE PRECISELY, THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE BAD CONSCIENCE WITH THE CONCEPT OF GOD); AND AT THE END OF THE LAST SECTION I EVEN SPOKE AS IF THIS MORALIZATION HAD NOT TAKEN PLACE AT ALL, AND AS IF THESE CONCEPTS WERE NOW NECESSARILY DOOMED SINCE THEIR PRESUPPOSITION, THE FAITH IN OUR ‚ÄÚCREDITOR,‚ÄÙ1 IN GOD, HAD DISAPPEARED. THE REALITY IS, TO A FEARFUL DEGREE, OTHERWISE.

THE MORALIZATION OF THE CONCEPTS GUILT AND DUTY, THEIR BEING PUSHED BACK INTO THE BAD CONSCIENCE, ACTUALLY INVOLVES AN ATTEMPT TO REVERSE THE DIRECTION OF THE DEVELOPMENT DESCRIBED ABOVE, OR AT LEAST TO BRING IT TO A HALT: THE AIM NOW IS TO PRECLUDE PESSIMISTICALLY, ONCE AND FOR ALL, THE PROSPECT OF A FINAL DISCHARGE; THE AIM NOW IS TO MAKE THE GLANCE RECOIL DISCONSOLATELY FROM AN IRON IMPOSSIBILITY; THE AIM NOW IS TO TURN BACK THE CONCEPTS ‚ÄÚGUILT‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚDUTY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎBACK AGAINST WHOM? THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT: AGAINST THE ‚ÄÚDEBTOR‚ÄÙ FIRST OF ALL, IN WHOM FROM NOW ON THE BAD CONSCIENCE IS FIRMLY ROOTED, EATING INTO HIM AND SPREADING WITHIN HIM LIKE A POLYP, UNTIL AT LAST THE IRREDEEMABLE DEBT GIVES RISE TO THE CONCEPTION OF IRREDEEMABLE PENANCE, THE IDEA THAT IT CANNOT BE DISCHARGED (‚ÄÚETERNAL PUNISHMENT‚ÄÙ). FINALLY, HOWEVER, THEY ARE TURNED BACK AGAINST THE ‚ÄÚCREDITOR,‚ÄÙ TOO: WHETHER WE THINK OF THE CAUSA PRIMA OF MAN, THE BEGINNING OF THE HUMAN RACE, ITS PRIMAL ANCESTOR WHO IS FROM NOW ON BURDENED WITH A CURSE (‚ÄÚADAM,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚORIGINAL SIN,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚUN-FREEDOM OF THE WILL‚ÄÙ), OR OF NATURE FROM WHOSE WOMB MANKIND AROSE AND INTO WHOM THE PRINCIPLE OF EVIL IS PROJECTED FROM NOW ON (‚ÄÚTHE DIABOLIZING OF NATURE‚ÄÙ), OR OF EXISTENCE IN GENERAL, WHICH IS NOW CONSIDERED WORTHLESS AS SUCH (NIHILISTIC WITHDRAWAL FROM IT, A DESIRE FOR NOTHINGNESS OR A DESIRE FOR ITS ANTITHESIS, FOR A DIFFERENT MODE OF BEING, BUDDHISM AND THE LIKE)‚ÄÎSUDDENLY WE STAND BEFORE THE PARADOXICAL AND HORRIFYING EXPEDIENT THAT AFFORDED TEMPORARY RELIEF FOR TORMENTED HUMANITY, THAT STROKE OF GENIUS ON THE PART OF CHRISTIANITY: GOD HIMSELF SACRIFICES HIMSELF FOR THE GUILT OF MANKIND, GOD HIMSELF MAKES PAYMENT TO HIMSELF, GOD AS THE ONLY BEING WHO CAN REDEEM MAN FROM WHAT HAS BECOME UNREDEEMABLE FOR MAN HIMSELF‚ÄÎTHE CREDITOR SACRIFICES HIMSELF FOR HIS DEBTOR, OUT OF LOVE (CAN ONE CREDIT THAT?), OUT OF LOVE FOR HIS DEBTOR!‚ÄÎ

YOU WILL HAVE GUESSED WHAT HAS REALLY HAPPENED HERE, BENEATH ALL THIS; THAT WILL TO SELF-TORMENTING, THAT REPRESSED CRUELTY OF THE ANIMAL-MAN MADE INWARD AND SCARED BACK INTO HIMSELF, THE CREATURE IMPRISONED IN THE ‚ÄÚSTATE‚ÄÙ SO AS TO BE TAMED, WHO INVENTED THE BAD CONSCIENCE IN ORDER TO HURT HIMSELF AFTER THE MORE NATURAL VENT FOR THIS DESIRE TO HURT HAD BEEN BLOCKED‚ÄÎTHIS MAN OF THE BAD CONSCIENCE HAS SEIZED UPON THE PRESUPPOSITION OF RELIGION SO AS TO DRIVE HIS SELF-TORTURE TO ITS MOST GRUESOME PITCH OF SEVERITY AND RIGOR. GUILT BEFORE GOD: THIS THOUGHT BECOMES AN INSTRUMENT OF TORTURE TO HIM. HE APPREHENDS IN ‚ÄÚGOD‚ÄÙ THE ULTIMATE ANTITHESIS OF HIS OWN INELUCTABLE ANIMAL INSTINCTS; HE REINTERPRETS THESE ANIMAL INSTINCTS THEMSELVES AS A FORM OF GUILT BEFORE GOD (AS HOSTILITY, REBELLION, INSURRECTION AGAINST THE ‚ÄÚLORD,‚ÄÙ THE ‚ÄÚFATHER,‚ÄÙ THE PRIMAL ANCESTOR AND ORIGIN OF THE WORLD); HE-STRETCHES HIMSELF UPON THE CONTRADICTION ‚ÄÚGOD‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚDEVIL;‚ÄÙ HE EJECTS FROM HIMSELF ALL HIS DENIAL OF HIMSELF, OF HIS NATURE, NATURALNESS, AND ACTUALITY, IN THE FORM OF AN AFFIRMATION, AS SOMETHING EXISTENT, CORPOREAL, REAL, AS GOD, AS THE HOLINESS OF GOD, AS GOD THE JUDGE, AS GOD THE HANGMAN, AS THE BEYOND, AS ETERNITY, AS TORMENT WITHOUT END, AS HELL, AS THE IMMEASURABILITY OF PUNISHMENT AND GUILT.

IN THIS PSYCHICAL CRUELTY THERE RESIDES A MADNESS OF THE WILL WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY UNEXAMPLED: THE WILL OF MAN TO FIND HIMSELF GUILTY AND REPREHENSIBLE TO A DEGREE THAT CAN NEVER BE ATONED FOR; HIS WILL TO THINK HIMSELF PUNISHED WITHOUT ANY POSSIBILITY OF THE PUNISHMENT BECOMING EQUAL TO THE GUILT; HIS WILL TO INFECT AND POISON THE FUNDAMENTAL GROUND OF THINGS WITH THE PROBLEM OF PUNISHMENT AND GUILT SO AS TO CUT OFF ONCE AND FOR ALL HIS OWN EXIT FROM THIS LABYRINTH OF ‚ÄÚFIXED IDEAS;‚ÄÙ HIS WILL TO ERECT AN IDEAL‚ÄÎTHAT OF THE ‚ÄÚHOLY GOD‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND IN THE FACE OF IT TO FEEL THE PALPABLE CERTAINTY OF HIS OWN ABSOLUTE UNWORTHINESS. OH THIS INSANE, PATHETIC BEAST‚ÄÎMAN! WHAT IDEAS HE HAS, WHAT UNNATURALNESS, WHAT PAROXYSMS OF NONSENSE, WHAT BESTIALITY OF THOUGHT ERUPTS AS SOON AS HE IS PREVENTED JUST A LITTLE FROM BEING A BEAST IN DEED!

ALL THIS IS INTERESTING, TO EXCESS, BUT ALSO OF A GLOOMY, BLACK, UNNERVING SADNESS, SO THAT ONE MUST FORCIBLY FORBID ONESELF TO GAZE TOO LONG INTO THESE ABYSSES. HERE IS SICKNESS, BEYOND ANY DOUBT, THE MOST TERRIBLE SICKNESS THAT HAS EVER RAGED IN MAN; AND WHOEVER CAN STILL BEAR TO HEAR (BUT TODAY ONE NO LONGER HAS EARS FOR THIS!) HOW IN THIS NIGHT OF TORMENT AND ABSURDITY THERE HAS RESOUNDED THE CRY OF LOVE, THE CRY OF THE MOST NOSTALGIC RAPTURE, OF REDEMPTION THROUGH LOVE, WILL TURN AWAY, SEIZED BY INVINCIBLE HORROR.‚ÄÎTHERE IS SO MUCH IN MAN THAT IS HIDEOUS!‚ÄÎTOO LONG, THE EARTH HAS BEEN A MADHOUSE!‚ÄÎ





23


THIS SHOULD DISPOSE ONCE AND FOR ALL OF THE QUESTION OF HOW THE ‚ÄÚHOLY GOD‚ÄÙ ORIGINATED.

THAT THE CONCEPTION OF GODS IN ITSELF NEED NOT LEAD TO THE DEGRADATION OF THE IMAGINATION THAT WE HAD TO CONSIDER BRIEFLY, THAT THERE ARE NOBLER USES FOR THE INVENTION OF GODS THAN FOR THE SELF-CRUCIFIXION AND SELF-VIOLATION OF MAN IN WHICH EUROPE OVER THE PAST MILLENNIA ACHIEVED ITS DISTINCTIVE MASTERY‚ÄÎTHAT IS FORTUNATELY REVEALED EVEN BY A MERE GLANCE AT THE GREEK GODS, THOSE REFLECTIONS OF NOBLE AND AUTOCRATIC MEN, IN WHOM THE ANIMAL IN MAN FELT DEIFIED AND DID NOT LACERATE ITSELF, DID NOT RAGE AGAINST ITSELF! FOR THE LONGEST TIME THESE GREEKS USED THEIR GODS PRECISELY SO AS TO WARD OFF THE ‚ÄÚBAD CONSCIENCE,‚ÄÙ SO AS TO BE ABLE TO REJOICE IN THEIR FREEDOM OF SOUL‚ÄÎTHE VERY OPPOSITE OF THE USE TO WHICH CHRISTIANITY PUT ITS GOD. THEY WENT VERY FAR IN THIS DIRECTION, THESE SPLENDID AND LION-HEARTED CHILDREN; AND NO LESS AN AUTHORITY THAN THE HOMERIC ZEUS HIMSELF OCCASIONALLY GIVES THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE MAKING THINGS TOO EASY FOR THEMSELVES. ‚ÄÚSTRANGE!‚ÄÙ HE SAYS ONCE‚ÄÎTHE CASE IS THAT OF AEGISTHUS, A VERY BAD CASE‚ÄÎ

STRANGE HOW THESE MORTALS SO LOUDLY COMPLAIN OF THE GODS!

WE ALONE PRODUCE EVIL, THEY SAY; YET THEMSELVES

MAKE THEMSELVES WRETCHED THROUGH FOLLY, EVEN COUNTER TO FATE.1



YET ONE CAN SEE AND HEAR HOW EVEN THIS OLYMPIAN SPECTATOR AND JUDGE IS FAR FROM HOLDING A GRUDGE AGAINST THEM OR THINKING ILL OF THEM ON THAT ACCOUNT: ‚ÄÚHOW FOOLISH THEY ARE!‚ÄÙ HE THINKS WHEN HE OBSERVES THE MISDEEDS OF MORTALS‚ÄÎAND ‚ÄÚFOOLISHNESS,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚFOLLY,‚ÄÙ A LITTLE ‚ÄÚDISTURBANCE IN THE HEAD,‚ÄÙ THIS MUCH EVEN THE GREEKS OF THE STRONGEST, BRAVEST AGE CONCEDED OF THEMSELVES AS THE REASON FOR MUCH THAT WAS BAD AND CALAMITOUS‚ÄÎFOOLISHNESS, NOT SIN! DO YOU GRASP THAT?

EVEN THIS DISTURBANCE IN THE HEAD, HOWEVER, PRESENTED A PROBLEM: ‚ÄÚHOW IS IT POSSIBLE? HOW COULD IT ACTUALLY HAVE HAPPENED TO HEADS SUCH AS WE HAVE, WE MEN OF ARISTOCRATIC DESCENT, OF THE BEST SOCIETY, HAPPY, WELL-CONSTITUTED, NOBLE, AND VIRTUOUS?‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHUS NOBLE GREEKS ASKED THEMSELVES FOR CENTURIES IN THE FACE OF EVERY INCOMPREHENSIBLE ATROCITY OR WANTONNESS WITH WHICH ONE OF THEIR KIND HAD POLLUTED HIMSELF. ‚ÄÚHE MUST HAVE BEEN DELUDED BY A GOD‚ÄÙ THEY CONCLUDED FINALLY, SHAKING THEIR HEADS‚Ä¶THIS EXPEDIENT IS TYPICAL OF THE GREEKS‚Ä¶IN THIS WAY THE GODS SERVED IN THOSE DAYS TO JUSTIFY MAN TO A CERTAIN EXTENT EVEN IN HIS WICKEDNESS, THEY SERVED AS THE ORIGINATORS OF EVIL‚ÄÎIN THOSE DAYS THEY TOOK UPON THEMSELVES, NOT THE PUNISHMENT BUT, WHAT IS NOBLER, THE GUILT.2





24


I END UP WITH THREE QUESTION MARKS; THAT SEEMS PLAIN. ‚ÄÚWHAT ARE YOU REALLY DOING, ERECTING AN IDEAL OR KNOCKING ONE DOWN?‚ÄÙ I MAY PERHAPS BE ASKED.

BUT HAVE YOU EVER ASKED YOURSELVES SUFFICIENTLY HOW MUCH THE ERECTION OF EVERY IDEAL ON EARTH HAS COST? HOW MUCH REALITY HAS HAD TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD AND SLANDERED, HOW MANY LIES HAVE HAD TO BE SANCTIFIED, HOW MANY CONSCIENCES DISTURBED, HOW MUCH ‚ÄÚGOD‚ÄÙ SACRIFICED EVERY TIME? IF A TEMPLE IS TO BE ERECTED A TEMPLE MUST BE DESTROYED: THAT IS THE LAW‚ÄÎLET ANYONE WHO CAN SHOW ME A CASE IN WHICH IT IS NOT FULFILLED!

WE MODERN MEN ARE THE HEIRS OF THE CONSCIENCE-VIVISECTION AND SELF-TORTURE3 OF MILLENNIA: THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE PRACTICED LONGEST, IT IS OUR DISTINCTIVE ART PERHAPS, AND IN ANY CASE OUR SUBTLETY IN WHICH WE HAVE ACQUIRED A REFINED TASTE. MAN HAS ALL TOO LONG HAD AN ‚ÄÚEVIL EYE‚ÄÙ FOR HIS NATURAL INCLINATIONS, SO THAT THEY HAVE FINALLY BECOME INSEPARABLE FROM HIS ‚ÄÚBAD CONSCIENCE.‚ÄÙ AN ATTEMPT AT THE REVERSE WOULD IN ITSELF BE POSSIBLE‚ÄÎBUT WHO IS STRONG ENOUGH FOR IT?‚ÄÎTHAT IS, TO WED THE BAD CONSCIENCE TO ALL THE UNNATURAL INCLINATIONS, ALL THOSE ASPIRATIONS TO THE BEYOND, TO THAT WHICH RUNS COUNTER TO SENSE, INSTINCT, NATURE, ANIMAL, IN SHORT ALL IDEALS HITHERTO, WHICH ARE ONE AND ALL HOSTILE TO LIFE AND IDEALS THAT SLANDER THE WORLD. TO WHOM SHOULD ONE TURN TODAY WITH SUCH HOPES AND DEMANDS?

ONE WOULD HAVE PRECISELY THE GOOD MEN AGAINST ONE; AND, OF COURSE, THE COMFORTABLE, THE RECONCILED, THE VAIN, THE SENTIMENTAL, THE WEARY.

WHAT GIVES GREATER OFFENSE, WHAT SEPARATES ONE MORE FUNDAMENTALLY, THAN TO REVEAL SOMETHING OF THE SEVERITY AND RESPECT WITH WHICH ONE TREATS ONESELF? AND ON THE OTHER HAND‚ÄÎHOW ACCOMMODATING, HOW FRIENDLY ALL THE WORLD IS TOWARD US AS SOON AS WE ACT AS ALL THE WORLD DOES AND ‚ÄÚLET OURSELVES GO‚ÄÙ LIKE ALL THE WORLD!

THE ATTAINMENT OF THIS GOAL WOULD REQUIRE A DIFFERENT KIND OF SPIRIT FROM THAT LIKELY TO APPEAR IN THIS PRESENT AGE: SPIRITS STRENGTHENED BY WAR AND VICTORY, FOR WHOM CONQUEST, ADVENTURE, DANGER, AND EVEN PAIN HAVE BECOME NEEDS; IT WOULD REQUIRE HABITUATION TO THE KEEN AIR OF THE HEIGHTS, TO WINTER JOURNEYS, TO ICE AND MOUNTAINS IN EVERY SENSE; IT WOULD REQUIRE EVEN A KIND OF SUBLIME WICKEDNESS, AN ULTIMATE, SUPREMELY SELF-CONFIDENT MISCHIEVOUSNESS IN KNOWLEDGE THAT GOES WITH GREAT HEALTH; IT WOULD REQUIRE, IN BRIEF AND ALAS, PRECISELY THIS GREAT HEALTH!

IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE TODAY?‚ÄÎBUT SOME DAY, IN A STRONGER AGE THAN THIS DECAYING, SELF-DOUBTING PRESENT, HE MUST YET COME TO US, THE REDEEMING MAN OF GREAT LOVE AND CONTEMPT, THE CREATIVE SPIRIT WHOSE COMPELLING STRENGTH WILL NOT LET HIM REST IN ANY ALOOFNESS OR ANY BEYOND, WHOSE ISOLATION IS MISUNDERSTOOD BY THE PEOPLE AS IF IT WERE FLIGHT FROM REALITY‚ÄÎWHILE IT IS ONLY HIS ABSORPTION, IMMERSION, PENETRATION INTO REALITY, SO THAT, WHEN HE ONE DAY EMERGES AGAIN INTO THE LIGHT, HE MAY BRING HOME THE REDEMPTION OF THIS REALITY: ITS REDEMPTION FROM THE CURSE THAT THE HITHERTO REIGNING IDEAL HAS LAID UPON IT. THIS MAN OF THE FUTURE, WHO WILL REDEEM US NOT ONLY FROM THE HITHERTO REIGNING IDEAL BUT ALSO FROM THAT WHICH WAS BOUND TO GROW OUT OF IT, THE GREAT NAUSEA, THE WILL TO NOTHINGNESS, NIHILISM; THIS BELL-STROKE OF NOON AND OF THE GREAT DECISION THAT LIBERATES THE WILL AGAIN AND RESTORES ITS GOAL TO THE EARTH AND HIS HOPE TO MAN; THIS ANTICHRIST AND ANTINIHILIST; THIS VICTOR OVER GOD AND NOTHINGNESS‚ÄÎHE MUST COME ONE DAY.‚ÄÎ





25


BUT WHAT AM I SAYING? ENOUGH! ENOUGH! AT THIS POINT IT BEHOOVES ME ONLY TO BE SILENT; OR I SHALL USURP THAT TO WHICH ONLY ONE YOUNGER, ‚ÄÚHEAVIER WITH FUTURE,‚ÄÙ AND STRONGER THAN I HAS A RIGHT‚ÄÎTHAT TO WHICH ONLY ZARATHUSTRA HAS A RIGHT, ZARATHUSTRA THE GODLESS.‚ÄÎ


1SCHLECHTES GEWISSEN IS NO TECHNICAL TERM BUT SIMPLY THE COMMON GERMAN EQUIVALENT OF ‚ÄÚBAD CONSCIENCE.‚ÄÙ DANTO‚ÄÔS TRANSLATION ‚ÄÚBAD CONSCIOUSNESS‚ÄÙ (NIETZSCHE AS PHILOSOPHER, NEW YORK, MACMILLAN, 1965) IS SIMPLY WRONG: GEWISSEN, LIKE CONSCIENCE, AND UNLIKE THE FRENCH CONSCIENCE, CANNOT MEAN CONSCIOUSNESS.

THERE ARE MANY MISTRANSLATIONS IN DANTO‚ÄÔS NIETZSCHE. ANOTHER ONE, THOUGH RELATIVELY UNIMPORTANT, IS OF SOME INTEREST AND RELEVANT TO THE GENEALOGY: SCHADENFREUDE‚ÄÎA GERMAN WORD FOR WHICH THERE IS NO ENGLISH EQUIVALENT‚ÄÎIS NOT QUITE ‚ÄÚTHE WICKED PLEASURE IN THE BEHOLDING OF SUFFERING‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚIN THE SHEER SPECTACLE OF SUFFERING: IN FIGHTS, EXECUTIONS,‚Ä¶BULLBAITING, COCKFIGHTS, AND THE LIKE‚ÄÙ. IN SUCH CONTEXTS THE WORD IS UTTERLY OUT OF PLACE: IT SIGNIFIES THE PETTY, MISCHIEVOUS DELIGHT FELT IN THE DISCOMFITURE OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.

2THE PARENTHETICAL STATEMENT IS THE CONTRARY OF KANT‚ÄÔS VIEW. WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN, IT MUST HAVE STRUCK MOST READERS AS PARADOXICAL, BUT IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY IT IS APT TO SEEM LESS PARADOXICAL THAN KANT‚ÄÔS VIEW. THE LONELY CROWD (BY DAVID RIESMAN, WITH NATHAN GLAZER AND REUEL DENNEY; NEW HAVEN, CONN.: YALE UNIVERSITY PRESS, 1950) HAS POPULARIZED A NIETZSCHEAN, NON-KANTIAN CONCEPTION OF THE AUTONOMOUS INDIVIDUAL, WHO IS CONTRASTED WITH THE TRADITION-DIRECTED (NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS MORALITY OF MORES), THE INNER-DIRECTED (KANT, FOR EXAMPLE), AND THE OTHER-DIRECTED (NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚLAST MAN‚ÄÙ).

1THE GERMAN EQUIVALENT OF ‚ÄÚGUILT‚ÄÙ IS SCHULD; AND THE GERMAN FOR ‚ÄÚDEBT(S)‚ÄÙ IS SCHULD(EN). ‚ÄÚINNOCENT‚ÄÙ IS UNSCHULDIG; ‚ÄÚDEBTOR‚ÄÙ IS SCHULDNER; AND SO FORTH. THIS OBVIOUSLY POSES PROBLEMS FOR AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF THIS ESSAY; BUT ONCE THE POINT HAS BEEN CLEARLY STATED, NO MISUNDERSTANDINGS NEED RESULT. NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CLAIMS OBVIOUSLY DO NOT DEPEND ON THE DOUBLE MEANING OF A GERMAN WORD; NOR ARE THEY WEAKENED BY THE FACT THAT IN ENGLISH THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT WORDS, ONE DERIVED FROM AN ANGLO-SAXON ROOT, THE OTHER FROM LATIN.

AUFHEBEN IS A VERY TROUBLESOME WORD, THOUGH COMMON IN ORDINARY GERMAN. LITERALLY, IT MEANS ‚ÄÚPICK UP;‚ÄÙ BUT IT HAS TWO DERIVATIVE MEANINGS THAT ARE NO LESS COMMON: ‚ÄÚCANCEL‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚPRESERVE‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚKEEP.‚ÄÙ SOMETHING PICKED UP IS NO LONGER THERE, BUT THE POINT OF PICKING IT UP MAY BE TO KEEP IT. HEGEL MADE MUCH OF THIS TERM; HIS USE OF IT IS EXPLAINED AND DISCUSSED IN WALTER KAUFMANN, HEGEL (GARDEN CITY, N.Y., DOUBLEDAY, 1965; GARDEN CITY, N.Y., DOUBLEDAY ANCHOR BOOKS, 1966), SECTION 34‚ÄÎAND A COMPARISON OF HEGEL AND NIETZSCHE ON THIS POINT MAY BE FOUND IN KAUFMANN‚ÄÔS NIETZSCHE, CHAPTER 8, SECTION II.

2THE THEME SOUNDED HERE IS ONE OF THE CENTRAL MOTIFS OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS PHILOSOPHY. CF.

WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ASCETIC IDEALS?‚ÄÎIN THE CASE OF ARTISTS THEY MEAN NOTHING OR TOO MANY THINGS; IN THE CASE OF PHILOSOPHERS AND SCHOLARS SOMETHING LIKE A SENSE AND INSTINCT FOR THE MOST FAVORABLE PRECONDITIONS OF HIGHER SPIRITUALITY; IN THE CASE OF WOMEN AT BEST ONE MORE SEDUCTIVE CHARM, A TOUCH OF MORBIDEZZA IN FAIR FLESH, THE ANGELIC LOOK OF A PLUMP PRETTY ANIMAL; IN THE CASE OF THE PHYSIOLOGICALLY DEFORMED AND DERANGED (THE MAJORITY OF MORTALS) AN ATTEMPT TO SEE THEMSELVES AS ‚ÄÚTOO GOOD‚ÄÙ FOR THIS WORLD, A SAINTLY FORM OF DEBAUCH, THEIR CHIEF WEAPON IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST SLOW PAIN AND BOREDOM; IN THE CASE OF PRIESTS THE DISTINCTIVE PRIESTLY FAITH, THEIR BEST INSTRUMENT OF POWER, ALSO THE ‚ÄÚSUPREME‚ÄÙ LICENSE FOR POWER; IN THE CASE OF SAINTS, FINALLY, A PRETEXT FOR HIBERNATION, THEIR NOVISSIMA GLORIAE CUPIDO,2 THEIR REPOSE IN NOTHINGNESS (‚ÄÚGOD‚ÄÙ), THEIR FORM OF MADNESS. THAT THE ASCETIC IDEAL HAS MEANT SO MANY THINGS TO MAN, HOWEVER, IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE BASIC FACT OF THE HUMAN WILL, ITS HORROR VACUI.3 IT NEEDS A GOAL‚ÄÎAND IT WILL RATHER WILL NOTHINGNESS THAN NOT WILL.‚ÄÎAM I UNDERSTOOD? ‚Ä¶ HAVE I BEEN UNDERSTOOD? ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄÚNOT AT ALL, MY DEAR SIR!‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHEN LET US START AGAIN, FROM THE BEGINNING.

WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ASCETIC IDEALS?‚ÄÎOR, TO TAKE AN INDIVIDUAL CASE THAT I HAVE OFTEN BEEN ASKED ABOUT: WHAT DOES IT MEAN, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN AN ARTIST LIKE RICHARD WAGNER PAYS HOMAGE TO CHASTITY IN HIS OLD AGE? IN A CERTAIN SENSE, TO BE SURE, HE HAD ALWAYS DONE THIS: BUT ONLY IN THE VERY END IN AN ASCETIC SENSE. WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS CHANGE OF ‚ÄÚSENSE,‚ÄÙ THIS RADICAL REVERSAL OF SENSE?‚ÄÎFOR THAT IS WHAT IT WAS: WAGNER LEAPED OVER INTO HIS OPPOSITE. WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN AN ARTIST LEAPS OVER INTO HIS OPPOSITE?

HERE, IF WE ARE DISPOSED TO PAUSE A MOMENT AT THIS QUESTION, WE ARE AT ONCE REMINDED OF WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE FINEST, STRONGEST, HAPPIEST, MOST COURAGEOUS PERIOD OF WAGNER‚ÄÔS LIFE: THE PERIOD DURING WHICH HE WAS DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH THE IDEA OF LUTHER‚ÄÔS WEDDING. WHO KNOWS UPON WHAT CHANCE EVENTS IT DEPENDED THAT INSTEAD OF THIS WEDDING MUSIC WE POSSESS TODAY DIE MEISTERSINGER? AND HOW MUCH OF THE FORMER PERHAPS STILL ECHOES IN THE LATTER? BUT THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT ‚ÄÚLUTHER‚ÄÔS WEDDING‚ÄÙ WOULD ALSO HAVE INVOLVED A PRAISE OF CHASTITY. AND ALSO A PRAISE OF SENSUALITY, TO BE SURE‚ÄÎAND THIS WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO BE QUITE IN ORDER, QUITE ‚ÄÚWAGNERIAN.‚ÄÙ

FOR THERE IS NO NECESSARY ANTITHESIS BETWEEN CHASTITY AND SENSUALITY;1 EVERY GOOD MARRIAGE, EVERY GENUINE LOVE AFFAIR, TRANSCENDS THIS ANTITHESIS. WAGNER WOULD HAVE DONE WELL, I THINK, TO HAVE BROUGHT THIS PLEASANT TACT HOME ONCE MORE TO HIS GERMANS BY MEANS OF A BOLD AND BEAUTIFUL LUTHER COMEDY, FOR THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL ARE MANY SLANDERERS OF SENSUALITY AMONG THE GERMANS; AND PERHAPS LUTHER PERFORMED NO GREATER SERVICE THAN TO HAVE HAD THE COURAGE OF HIS SENSUALITY (IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS CALLED, DELICATELY ENOUGH, ‚ÄÚEVANGELICAL FREEDOM‚ÄÙ). BUT EVEN IN THOSE CASES IN WHICH THIS ANTITHESIS BETWEEN CHASTITY AND SENSUALITY REALLY EXISTS, THERE IS FORTUNATELY NO NEED FOR IT TO BE A TRAGIC ANTITHESIS. AT LEAST THIS HOLDS GOOD FOR ALL THOSE WELL-CONSTITUTED, JOYFUL MORTALS WHO ARE FAR FROM REGARDING THEIR UNSTABLE EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN ‚ÄÚANIMAL AND ANGEL‚ÄÙ AS NECESSARILY AN ARGUMENT AGAINST EXISTENCE‚ÄÎTHE SUBTLEST AND BRIGHTEST AMONG THEM HAVE EVEN FOUND IN IT, LIKE GOETHE AND HAFIZ, ONE MORE STIMULUS TO LIFE. IT IS PRECISELY SUCH ‚ÄÚCONTRADICTIONS‚ÄÙ THAT SEDUCE ONE TO EXISTENCE‚Ä¶ ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS ONLY TOO CLEAR THAT WHEN SWINE WHO HAVE COME TO GRIEF ARE FINALLY INDUCED TO WORSHIP CHASTITY‚ÄÎAND THERE ARE SUCH SWINE!‚ÄÎTHEY WILL SEE AND WORSHIP IN IT ONLY THEIR ANTITHESIS, THE ANTITHESIS OF FAILED SWINE‚ÄÎAND ONE CAN IMAGINE WITH WHAT TRAGIC ZEAL AND GRUNTING THEY WILL DO SO!‚ÄÎTHAT EMBARRASSING AND SUPERFLUOUS ANTITHESIS WHICH RICHARD WAGNER AT THE END OF HIS LIFE UNQUESTIONABLY INTENDED TO SET TO MUSIC AND PUT UPON THE STAGE. BUT WHY? AS ONE MIGHT REASONABLY ASK. FOR WHAT WERE SWINE TO HIM, WHAT ARE THEY TO US?‚ÄÎ





3


THIS DOES NOT, OF COURSE, HELP US TO AVOID ASKING THIS OTHER QUESTION, WHAT THAT MALE (YET SO UNMANLY) ‚ÄÚCOUNTRY SIMPLETON‚ÄÙ WAS TO HIM, THAT POOR DEVIL AND NATURE, BOY PARSIFAL, WHOM HE FINALLY MADE INTO A CATHOLIC BY SUCH CAPTIOUS MEANS‚ÄÎWHAT? WAS THIS PARSIFAL MEANT SERIOUSLY? FOR ONE MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO SUPPOSE THE REVERSE, EVEN TO DESIRE IT‚ÄÎTHAT THE WAGNERIAN PARSIFAL WAS INTENDED AS A JOKE, AS A KIND OF EPILOGUE AND SATYR PLAY WITH WHICH THE TRAGEDIAN WAGNER WANTED TO TAKE LEAVE OF US, ALSO OF HIMSELF, ABOVE ALL OF TRAGEDY IN A FITTING MANNER WORTHY OF HIMSELF, NAMELY WITH AN EXTRAVAGANCE OF WANTON PARODY OF THE TRAGIC ITSELF, OF THE WHOLE GRUESOME EARTHLY SERIOUSNESS AND MISERY OF HIS PREVIOUS WORKS, OF THE CRUDEST FORM, OVERCOME AT LONG LAST, OF THE ANTI-NATURE OF THE ASCETIC IDEAL. THIS, TO REPEAT, WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF A GREAT TRAGEDIAN, WHO, LIKE EVERY ARTIST, ARRIVES AT THE ULTIMATE PINNACLE OF HIS GREATNESS ONLY WHEN HE COMES TO SEE HIMSELF AND HIS ART BENEATH HIM‚ÄÎWHEN HE KNOWS HOW TO LAUGH AT HIMSELF.

IS WAGNER‚ÄÔS PARSIFAL HIS SECRET LAUGHTER OF SUPERIORITY AT HIMSELF, THE TRIUMPH OF HIS ULTIMATE ARTIST‚ÄÔS FREEDOM AND ARTIST‚ÄÔS TRANSCENDENCE? ONE COULD WISH THAT IT WERE, TO REPEAT AGAIN; FOR WHAT WOULD A SERIOUSLY-INTENDED PARSIFAL BE? MUST ONE REALLY SEE IN HIM (AS SOMEONE ONCE PUT IT TO ME) ‚ÄÚTHE PRODUCT OF AN INSANE HATRED OF KNOWLEDGE, SPIRIT, AND SENSUALITY‚ÄÙ? A CURSE ON THE SENSES AND THE SPIRIT IN A SINGLE BREATH OF HATRED? AN APOSTACY AND RETURN TO MORBID CHRISTIAN AND OBSCURANTIST IDEALS? AND ULTIMATELY A SELF-NEGATION, A SELF-CANCELLATION ON THE PART OF AN ARTIST WHO HAD HITHERTO AIMED WITH ALL THE POWER OF HIS WILL AT THE REVERSE, AT THE HIGHEST SPIRITUALIZATION AND SENSUALIZATION OF HIS ART? AND NOT OF HIS ART ONLY; OF HIS LIFE, TOO.

ONE SHOULD RECALL HOW ENTHUSIASTICALLY WAGNER AT ONE TIME FOLLOWED IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE PHILOSOPHER FEUERBACH:1 FEUERBACH‚ÄÔS CRY OF ‚ÄÚHEALTHY SENSUALITY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT SOUNDED IN THE THIRTIES AND FORTIES, TO WAGNER AS TO MANY OTHER GERMANS (THEY CALLED THEMSELVES THE ‚ÄÚYOUNG GERMANS‚ÄÙ), LIKE A CRY OF REDEMPTION. DID HE AT LAST COME TO LEARN OTHERWISE? FOR AT LEAST IT SEEMS THAT HE FINALLY HAD THE WILL TO TEACH OTHERWISE. AND NOT ONLY FROM THE STAGE WITH THE TRUMPETS OF PARSIFAL; IN THE MURKY WRITINGS OF HIS LAST YEARS, AS UNFREE AS THEY ARE PERPLEXED, THERE ARE A HUNDRED PASSAGES THAT BETRAY A SECRET WISH AND WILL, A DESPAIRING, UNSURE, UNACKNOWLEDGED WILL TO PREACH NOTHING OTHER THAN REVERSION, CONVERSION, DENIAL, CHRISTIANITY, MEDIEVALISM, AND TO SAY TO HIS DISCIPLES ‚ÄÚIT IS NO GOOD! SEEK SALVATION ELSEWHERE!‚ÄÙ EVEN THE ‚ÄÚBLOOD OF THE REDEEMER‚ÄÙ IS INVOKED IN ONE PLACE.‚ÄÎ





4


IN SUCH A CASE AS THIS, EMBARRASSING IN MANY WAYS, MY VIEW IS‚ÄÎAND IT IS A TYPICAL CASE‚ÄÎTHAT ONE DOES BEST TO SEPARATE AN ARTIST FROM HIS WORK, NOT TAKING HIM AS SERIOUSLY AS HIS WORK. HE IS, AFTER ALL, ONLY THE PRECONDITION OF HIS WORK, THE WOMB, THE SOIL, SOMETIMES THE DUNG AND MANURE ON WHICH, OUT OF WHICH, IT GROWS‚ÄÎAND THEREFORE IN MOST CASES SOMETHING ONE MUST FORGET IF ONE IS TO ENJOY THE WORK ITSELF. INSIGHT INTO THE ORIGIN OF A WORK CONCERNS THE PHYSIOLOGISTS AND VIVISECTIONISTS OF THE SPIRIT; NEVER THE AESTHETIC MAN, THE ARTIST!

THE POET AND CREATOR OF PARSIFAL COULD NO MORE BE SPARED A DEEP, THOROUGH, EVEN FRIGHTFUL IDENTIFICATION WITH AND DESCENT INTO MEDIEVAL SOUL-CONFLICTS, A HOSTILE SEPARATION FROM ALL SPIRITUAL HEIGHT, SEVERITY, AND DISCIPLINE, A KIND OF INTELLECTUAL PERVERSITY (IF I MAY BE PARDONED THE WORD), THAN CAN A PREGNANT WOMAN BE SPARED THE REPELLENT AND BIZARRE ASPECTS OF PREGNANCY‚ÄÎWHICH, AS AFORESAID, MUST BE FORGOTTEN IF ONE IS TO ENJOY THE CHILD.

ONE SHOULD GUARD AGAINST CONFUSION THROUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTIGUITY, TO USE A BRITISH TERM,1 A CONFUSION TO WHICH AN ARTIST HIMSELF IS ONLY TOO PRONE: AS IF HE HIMSELF WERE WHAT HE IS ABLE TO REPRESENT, CONCEIVE, AND EXPRESS. THE FACT IS THAT IF HE WERE IT, HE WOULD NOT REPRESENT, CONCEIVE, AND EXPRESS IT: A HOMER WOULD NOT HAVE CREATED AN ACHILLES NOR A GOETHE A FAUST IF HOMER HAD BEEN AN ACHILLES OR GOETHE A FAUST. WHOEVER IS COMPLETELY AND WHOLLY AN ARTIST IS TO ALL ETERNITY SEPARATED FROM THE ‚ÄÚREAL,‚ÄÙ THE ACTUAL; ON THE OTHER HAND, ONE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW HE MAY SOMETIMES WEARY TO THE POINT OF DESPERATION OF THE ETERNAL ‚ÄÚUNREALITY‚ÄÙ AND FALSITY OF HIS INNERMOST EXISTENCE‚ÄÎAND THAT THEN HE MAY WELL ATTEMPT WHAT IS MOST FORBIDDEN HIM, TO LAY HOLD OF ACTUALITY, FOR ONCE ACTUALLY TO BE. WITH WHAT SUCCESS? THAT IS EASY TO GUESS.

IT IS THE TYPICAL VELLEITY OF THE ARTIST: THE SAME VELLEITY TO WHICH THE AGED WAGNER FELL VICTIM AND FOR WHICH HE HAD TO PAY SO HIGH AND FATEFUL A PRICE (IT COST HIM THOSE OF HIS FRIENDS WHO WERE VALUABLE). FINALLY, HOWEVER, QUITE APART FROM THIS VELLEITY, WHO WOULD NOT WISH FOR WAGNER‚ÄÔS OWN SAKE THAT HE HAD TAKEN LEAVE OF US AND OF HIS ART DIFFERENTLY, NOT WITH A PARSIFAL BUT IN A MORE TRIUMPHANT MANNER, MORE SELF-CONFIDENT, MORE WAGNERIAN‚ÄÎLESS MISLEADING, LESS AMBIGUOUS IN RELATION TO HIS OVER-ALL INTENTIONS, LESS SCHOPENHAUERIAN, LESS NIHILISTIC?





5


WHAT, THEN, IS THE MEANING OF ASCETIC IDEALS? IN THE CASE OF AN ARTIST, AS WE SEE, NOTHING WHATEVER!‚Ä¶OR SO MANY THINGS IT AMOUNTS TO NOTHING WHATEVER!

LET US, FIRST OF ALL, ELIMINATE THE ARTISTS: THEY DO NOT STAND NEARLY INDEPENDENTLY ENOUGH IN THE WORLD AND AGAINST THE WORLD FOR THEIR CHANGING VALUATIONS TO DESERVE ATTENTION IN THEMSELVES! THEY HAVE AT ALL TIMES BEEN VALETS OF SOME MORALITY, PHILOSOPHY, OR RELIGION; QUITE APART FROM THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE UNFORTUNATELY OFTEN BEEN ALL-TOO-PLIABLE COURTIERS OF THEIR OWN FOLLOWERS AND PATRONS, AND CUNNING FLATTERERS OF ANCIENT OR NEWLY ARRIVED POWERS. THEY ALWAYS NEED AT THE VERY LEAST PROTECTION, A PROP, AN ESTABLISHED AUTHORITY: ARTISTS NEVER STAND APART; STANDING ALONE IS CONTRARY TO THEIR DEEPEST INSTINCTS.

THUS RICHARD WAGNER, FOR EXAMPLE, USED THE PHILOSOPHER SCHOPENHAUER, WHEN THE LATTER‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚTIME HAD COME,‚ÄÙ AS HIS HERALD AND PROTECTION: WHO WOULD REGARD IT AS EVEN THINKABLE THAT HE WOULD HAVE HAD THE COURAGE FOR THE ASCETIC IDEAL WITHOUT THE PROP PROVIDED BY SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS PHILOSOPHY, WITHOUT THE AUTHORITY OF SCHOPENHAUER WHICH HAD GAINED ASCENDANCY IN EUROPE DURING THE SEVENTIES? (LET US LEAVE OUT OF ACCOUNT WHETHER IN THE NEW GERMANY AN ARTIST COULD HAVE EXISTED WHO LACKED THE MILK OF PIOUS, REICHS-PIOUS SENTIMENTS).

HERE WE HAVE ARRIVED AT THE MORE SERIOUS QUESTION: WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN A GENUINE PHILOSOPHER PAYS HOMAGE TO THE ASCETIC IDEAL, A GENUINELY INDEPENDENT SPIRIT LIKE SCHOPENHAUER, A MAN AND KNIGHT OF A STEELY EYE WHO HAD THE COURAGE TO BE HIMSELF, WHO KNEW HOW TO STAND ALONE WITHOUT FIRST WAITING FOR HERALDS AND SIGNS FROM ABOVE?

LET US HERE CONSIDER STRAIGHTAWAY THE REMARKABLE AND FOR MANY KINDS OF MEN EVEN FASCINATING ATTITUDE SCHOPENHAUER ADOPTED TOWARD ART: FOR IT WAS OBVIOUSLY FOR THE SAKE OF THIS THAT RICHARD WAGNER INITIALLY WENT OVER TO SCHOPENHAUER (PERSUADED, AS ONE KNOWS, BY A POET, BY HERWEGH1), AND DID SO TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THERE EXISTS A COMPLETE THEORETICAL CONTRADICTION BETWEEN HIS EARLIER AND HIS LATER AESTHETIC CREED‚ÄÎTHE FORMER SET DOWN, FOR EXAMPLE, IN OPERA AND DRAMA, THE LATTER IN THE WRITINGS HE PUBLISHED FROM 1870 ONWARD. SPECIFICALLY, HE RUTHLESSLY ALTERED‚ÄÎAND THIS IS PERHAPS MOST ASTONISHING‚ÄÎHIS JUDGMENT AS TO THE VALUE AND STATUS OF MUSIC: WHAT DID HE CARE THAT HE HAD FORMERLY MADE OF MUSIC A MEANS, A MEDIUM, A ‚ÄÚWOMAN‚ÄÙ WHO REQUIRED A GOAL, A MAN, IN ORDER TO PROSPER‚ÄÎNAMELY, DRAMA! HE GRASPED ALL AT ONCE THAT WITH THE SCHOPENHAUERIAN THEORY AND INNOVATION MORE COULD BE DONE IN MAJOREM MUSICAE GLORIAM2‚ÄÎNAMELY, WITH THE THEORY OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF MUSIC AS SCHOPENHAUER CONCEIVED IT: MUSIC SET APART FROM ALL THE OTHER ARTS, THE INDEPENDENT ART AS SUCH, NOT OFFERING IMAGES OF PHENOMENALITY, AS THE OTHER ARTS DID, BUT SPEAKING RATHER THE LANGUAGE OF THE WILL ITSELF, DIRECTLY OUT OF THE ‚ÄÚABYSS‚ÄÙ AS ITS MOST AUTHENTIC, ELEMENTAL, NONDERIVATIVE REVELATION. WITH THIS EXTRAORDINARY RISE IN THE VALUE OF MUSIC THAT APPEARED TO FOLLOW FROM SCHOPENHAUERIAN PHILOSOPHY, THE VALUE OF THE MUSICIAN HIMSELF ALL AT ONCE WENT UP IN AN UNHEARD-OF MANNER, TOO: FROM NOW ON HE BECAME AN ORACLE, A PRIEST, INDEED MORE THAN A PRIEST, A KIND OF MOUTHPIECE OF THE ‚ÄÚIN ITSELF‚ÄÙ OF THINGS, A TELEPHONE FROM THE BEYOND‚ÄÎHENCEFORTH HE UTTERED NOT ONLY MUSIC, THIS VENTRILOQUIST OF GOD‚ÄÎHE UTTERED METAPHYSICS: NO WONDER HE ONE DAY FINALLY UTTERED ASCETIC IDEALS:





6


SCHOPENHAUER MADE USE OF THE KANTIAN VERSION OF THE AESTHETIC PROBLEM‚ÄÎALTHOUGH HE CERTAINLY DID NOT VIEW IT WITH KANTIAN EYES. KANT THOUGHT HE WAS HONORING ART WHEN AMONG THE PREDICATES OF BEAUTY HE EMPHASIZED AND GAVE PROMINENCE TO THOSE WHICH ESTABLISH THE HONOR OF KNOWLEDGE: IMPERSONALITY AND UNIVERSALITY. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO INQUIRE WHETHER THIS WAS ESSENTIALLY A MISTAKE; ALL I WISH TO UNDERLINE IS THAT KANT, LIKE ALL PHILOSOPHERS, INSTEAD OF ENVISAGING THE AESTHETIC PROBLEM FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE ARTIST (THE CREATOR), CONSIDERED ART AND THE BEAUTIFUL PURELY FROM THAT OF THE ‚ÄÚSPECTATOR,‚ÄÙ AND UNCONSCIOUSLY INTRODUCED THE ‚ÄÚSPECTATOR‚ÄÙ INTO THE CONCEPT ‚ÄÚBEAUTIFUL.‚ÄÙ IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO BAD IF THIS ‚ÄÚSPECTATOR‚ÄÙ HAD AT LEAST BEEN SUFFICIENTLY FAMILIAR TO THE PHILOSOPHERS OF BEAUTY‚ÄÎNAMELY, AS A GREAT PERSONAL FACT AND EXPERIENCE, AS AN ABUNDANCE OF VIVID AUTHENTIC EXPERIENCES, DESIRES, SURPRISES, AND DELIGHTS IN THE REALM OF THE BEAUTIFUL! BUT I FEAR THAT THE REVERSE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE; AND SO THEY HAVE OFFERED US, FROM THE BEGINNING, DEFINITIONS IN WHICH, AS IN KANT‚ÄÔS FAMOUS DEFINITION OF THE BEAUTIFUL, A LACK OF ANY REFINED FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE REPOSES IN THE SHAPE OF A FAT WORM OF ERROR. ‚ÄÚTHAT IS BEAUTIFUL,‚ÄÙ SAID KANT,1 ‚ÄÚWHICH GIVES US PLEASURE WITHOUT INTEREST.‚ÄÙ WITHOUT INTEREST! COMPARE WITH THIS DEFINITION ONE FRAMED BY A GENUINE ‚ÄÚSPECTATOR‚ÄÙ AND ARTIST‚ÄÎSTENDHAL, WHO ONCE CALLED THE BEAUTIFUL UNE PROMESSE DE BONHEUR.2 AT ANY RATE HE REJECTED AND REPUDIATED THE ONE POINT ABOUT THE AESTHETIC CONDITION WHICH KANT HAD STRESSED: LE D√©SINT√©RESSEMENT. WHO IS RIGHT, KANT OR STENDHAL?

IF OUR AESTHETICIANS NEVER WEARY OF ASSERTING IN KANT‚ÄÔS FAVOR THAT, UNDER THE SPELL OF BEAUTY, ONE CAN EVEN VIEW UNDRAPED FEMALE STATUES ‚ÄÚWITHOUT INTEREST,‚ÄÙ ONE MAY LAUGH A LITTLE AT THEIR EXPENSE: THE EXPERIENCES OF ARTISTS ON THIS TICKLISH POINT ARE MORE ‚ÄÚINTERESTING,‚ÄÙ AND PYGMALION WAS IN ANY EVENT NOT NECESSARILY AN ‚ÄÚUNAESTHETIC MAN.‚ÄÙ LET US THINK THE MORE HIGHLY OF THE INNOCENCE OF OUR AESTHETICIANS WHICH IS REFLECTED IN SUCH ARGUMENTS; LET US, FOR EXAMPLE, CREDIT IT TO THE HONOR OF KANT THAT HE SHOULD EXPATIATE ON THE PECULIAR PROPERTIES OF THE SENSE OF TOUCH WITH THE NA√ØVET√© OF A COUNTRY PARSON!

AND HERE WE COME BACK TO SCHOPENHAUER, WHO STOOD MUCH CLOSER TO THE ARTS THAN KANT AND YET DID NOT FREE HIMSELF FROM THE SPELL OF THE KANTIAN DEFINITION: HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? THE CIRCUMSTANCE IS REMARKABLE ENOUGH: HE INTERPRETED THE TERM ‚ÄÚWITHOUT INTEREST‚ÄÙ IN AN EXTREMELY PERSONAL WAY, ON THE BASIS OF ONE OF HIS MOST REGULAR EXPERIENCES.

OF FEW THINGS DOES SCHOPENHAUER SPEAK WITH GREATER ASSURANCE THAN HE DOES OF THE EFFECT OF AESTHETIC CONTEMPLATION: HE SAYS OF IT THAT IT COUNTERACTS SEXUAL ‚ÄÚINTERESTEDNESS,‚ÄÙ LIKE LUPULIN AND CAMPHOR; HE NEVER WEARIED OF GLORIFYING THIS LIBERATION FROM THE ‚ÄÚWILL‚ÄÙ AS THE GREAT MERIT AND UTILITY OF THE AESTHETIC CONDITION. INDEED, ONE MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO ASK WHETHER HIS BASIC CONCEPTION OF ‚ÄÚWILL AND REPRESENTATION,‚ÄÙ THE THOUGHT THAT REDEMPTION FROM THE ‚ÄÚWILL‚ÄÙ COULD BE ATTAINED ONLY THROUGH ‚ÄÚREPRESENTATION,‚ÄÙ DID NOT ORIGINATE AS A GENERALIZATION FROM THIS SEXUAL EXPERIENCE. (IN ALL QUESTIONS CONCERNING SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS PHILOSOPHY, BY THE WAY, ONE SHOULD NEVER FORGET THAT IT WAS THE CONCEPTION OF A YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY-SIX; SO THAT IT PARTAKES NOT ONLY OF THE SPECIFIC QUALITIES OF SCHOPENHAUER, BUT ALSO OF THE SPECIFIC QUALITIES OF THAT PERIOD OF LIFE.) LISTEN, FOR INSTANCE, TO ONE OF THE MOST EXPLICIT OF THE COUNTLESS PASSAGES HE HAS WRITTEN IN PRAISE OF THE AESTHETIC CONDITION (WORLD AS WILL AND REPRESENTATION,3); LISTEN TO THE TONE, THE SUFFERING, THE HAPPINESS, THE GRATITUDE EXPRESSED IN SUCH WORDS.

‚ÄÚTHIS IS THE PAINLESS CONDITION THAT EPICURUS PRAISED AS THE HIGHEST GOOD AND THE CONDITION OF THE GODS; FOR A MOMENT WE ARE DELIVERED FROM THE VILE URGENCY OF THE WILL; WE CELEBRATE THE SABBATH OF THE PENAL SERVITUDE OF VOLITION; THE WHEEL OF IXION STANDS STILL!‚ÄÙ

WHAT VEHEMENCE OF DICTION! WHAT IMAGES OF TORMENT AND LONG DESPAIR! WHAT AN ALMOST PATHOLOGICAL ANTITHESIS BETWEEN ‚ÄÚA MOMENT‚ÄÙ AND THE USUAL ‚ÄÚWHEEL OF IXION,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚPENAL SERVITUDE OF VOLITION,‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚVILE URGENCY OF THE WILL!‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎBUT EVEN IF SCHOPENHAUER WAS A HUNDRED TIMES RIGHT IN HIS OWN CASE, WHAT INSIGHT DOES THAT GIVE US INTO THE NATURE OF THE BEAUTIFUL? SCHOPENHAUER DESCRIBED ONE EFFECT OF THE BEAUTIFUL, ITS CALMING EFFECT ON THE WILL‚ÄÎBUT IS THIS A REGULAR EFFECT? STENDHAL, AS WE HAVE SEEN, A NO LESS SENSUAL BUT MORE HAPPILY CONSTITUTED PERSON THAN SCHOPENHAUER, EMPHASIZES ANOTHER EFFECT OF THE BEAUTIFUL: ‚ÄÚTHE BEAUTIFUL PROMISES HAPPINESS;‚ÄÙ TO HIM THE FACT SEEMS TO BE PRECISELY THAT THE BEAUTIFUL AROUSES THE WILL (‚ÄÚINTERESTEDNESS‚ÄÙ). AND COULD ONE NOT FINALLY URGE AGAINST SCHOPENHAUER HIMSELF THAT HE WAS QUITE WRONG IN THINKING HIMSELF A KANTIAN IN THIS MATTER, THAT HE BY NO MEANS UNDERSTOOD THE KANTIAN DEFINITION OF THE BEAUTIFUL IN A KANTIAN SENSE‚ÄÎTHAT HE, TOO, WAS PLEASED BY THE BEAUTIFUL FROM AN ‚ÄÚINTERESTED‚ÄÙ VIEWPOINT, EVEN FROM THE VERY STRONGEST, MOST PERSONAL INTEREST: THAT OF A TORTURED MAN WHO GAINS RELEASE FROM HIS TORTURE?‚ÄÎ AND, TO RETURN TO OUR FIRST QUESTION, ‚ÄÚWHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN A PHILOSOPHER PAYS HOMAGE TO THE ASCETIC IDEAL?‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHERE WE GET AT ANY RATE A FIRST INDICATION: HE WANTS TO GAIN RELEASE FROM A TORTURE.‚ÄÎ

LET US NOT BECOME GLOOMY AS SOON AS WE HEAR THE WORD ‚ÄÚTORTURE‚ÄÙ: IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THERE IS PLENTY TO OFFSET AND MITIGATE THAT WORD‚ÄÎEVEN SOMETHING TO LAUGH AT. ABOVE ALL, WE SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE FACT THAT SCHOPENHAUER, WHO TREATED SEXUALITY AS A PERSONAL ENEMY (INCLUDING ITS TOOL, WOMAN, THAT ‚ÄÚINSTRUMENTUM DIABOLI‚ÄÙ1), NEEDED ENEMIES IN ORDER TO KEEP IN GOOD SPIRITS; THAT HE LOVED BILIOUS, BLACK-GREEN WORDS, THAT HE SCOLDED FOR THE SAKE OF SCOLDING, OUT OF PASSION; THAT HE WOULD HAVE BECOME ILL, BECOME A PESSIMIST (FOR HE WAS NOT ONE, HOWEVER MUCH HE DESIRED IT), IF DEPRIVED OF HIS ENEMIES, OF HEGEL, OF WOMAN, OF SENSUALITY AND THE WHOLE WILL TO EXISTENCE, TO PERSISTENCE. WITHOUT THESE, SCHOPENHAUER WOULD NOT HAVE PERSISTED, ONE MAY WAGER ON THAT; HE WOULD HAVE RUN AWAY: BUT HIS ENEMIES HELD HIM FAST, HIS ENEMIES SEDUCED HIM EVER AGAIN TO EXISTENCE; HIS ANGER WAS, JUST AS IN THE CASE OF THE CYNICS OF ANTIQUITY, HIS BALM, HIS REFRESHMENT, HIS REWARD, HIS SPECIFIC AGAINST DISGUST, HIS HAPPINESS. SO MUCH IN REGARD TO WHAT IS MOST PERSONAL IN THE CASE OF SCHOPENHAUER; ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS ALSO SOMETHING TYPICAL IN HIM‚ÄÎAND HERE WE FINALLY COME BACK TO OUR PROBLEM.

AS LONG AS THERE ARE PHILOSOPHERS ON EARTH, AND WHEREVER THERE HAVE BEEN PHILOSOPHERS (FROM INDIA TO ENGLAND, TO TAKE THE ANTITHETICAL POLES OF PHILOSOPHICAL ENDOWMENT), THERE UNQUESTIONABLY EXISTS A PECULIAR PHILOSOPHERS‚ÄÔ IRRITATION AT AND RANCOR AGAINST SENSUALITY: SCHOPENHAUER IS MERELY ITS MOST ELOQUENT AND, IF ONE HAS EARS FOR THIS, MOST RAVISHING AND DELIGHTFUL EXPRESSION. THERE ALSO EXISTS A PECULIAR PHILOSOPHERS‚ÄÔ PREJUDICE AND AFFECTION IN FAVOR OF THE WHOLE ASCETIC IDEAL; ONE SHOULD NOT OVERLOOK THAT. BOTH, TO REPEAT, PERTAIN TO THE TYPE; IF BOTH ARE LACKING IN A PHILOSOPHER, THEN‚ÄÎONE CAN BE SURE OF IT‚ÄÎHE IS ALWAYS ONLY A ‚ÄÚSO-CALLED‚ÄÙ PHILOSOPHER. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? FOR THIS FACT HAS TO BE INTERPRETED: IN ITSELF IT JUST STANDS THERE, STUPID TO ALL ETERNITY, LIKE EVERY ‚ÄÚTHING-IN-ITSELF.‚ÄÙ

EVERY ANIMAL‚ÄÎTHEREFORE LA B√™TE PHILOSOPHE,2 TOO‚ÄÎINSTINCTIVELY STRIVES FOR AN OPTIMUM OF FAVORABLE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH IT CAN EXPEND ALL ITS STRENGTH AND ACHIEVE ITS MAXIMAL FEELING OF POWER; EVERY ANIMAL ABHORS, JUST AS INSTINCTIVELY AND WITH A SUBTLETY OF DISCERNMENT THAT IS ‚ÄÚHIGHER THAN ALL REASON,‚ÄÙ EVERY KIND OF INTRUSION OR HINDRANCE THAT OBSTRUCTS OR COULD OBSTRUCT THIS PATH TO THE OPTIMUM (I AM NOT SPEAKING OF ITS PATH TO HAPPINESS, BUT ITS PATH TO POWER, TO ACTION, TO THE MOST POWERFUL ACTIVITY, AND IN MOST CASES ACTUALLY ITS PATH TO UNHAPPINESS). THUS THE PHILOSOPHER ABHORS MARRIAGE, TOGETHER WITH THAT WHICH MIGHT PERSUADE TO IT‚ÄÎMARRIAGE BEING A HINDRANCE AND CALAMITY ON HIS PATH TO THE OPTIMUM. WHAT GREAT PHILOSOPHER HITHERTO HAS BEEN MARRIED? HERACLITUS, PLATO, DESCARTES, SPINOZA, LEIBNIZ, KANT, SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÎTHEY WERE NOT; MORE, ONE CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE THEM MARRIED. A MARRIED PHILOSOPHER BELONGS IN COMEDY, THAT IS MY PROPOSITION‚ÄÎAND AS FOR THAT EXCEPTION, SOCRATES3‚ÄÎTHE MALICIOUS SOCRATES, IT WOULD SEEM, MARRIED IRONICALLY, JUST TO DEMONSTRATE THIS PROPOSITION.

EVERY PHILOSOPHER WOULD SPEAK AS BUDDHA DID WHEN HE WAS TOLD OF THE BIRTH OF A SON: ‚ÄÚRAHULA HAS BEEN BORN TO ME, A FETTER HAS BEEN FORGED FOR ME‚ÄÙ (RAHULA HERE MEANS ‚ÄÚA LITTLE DEMON‚ÄÙ); EVERY ‚ÄÚFREE SPIRIT‚ÄÙ WOULD EXPERIENCE A THOUGHTFUL MOMENT, SUPPOSING HE HAD PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED A THOUGHTLESS ONE, OF THE KIND THAT ONCE CAME TO THE SAME BUDDHA‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚNARROW AND OPPRESSIVE,‚ÄÙ HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF, ‚ÄÚIS LIFE IN A HOUSE, A PLACE OF IMPURITY; FREEDOM LIES IN LEAVING THE HOUSE‚ÄÙ: ‚ÄÚTHINKING THUS, HE LEFT THE HOUSE.‚ÄÙ ASCETIC IDEALS REVEAL SO MANY BRIDGES TO INDEPENDENCE THAT A PHILOSOPHER IS BOUND TO REJOICE AND CLAP HIS HANDS WHEN HE HEARS THE STORY OF ALL THOSE RESOLUTE MEN WHO ONE DAY SAID NO TO ALL SERVITUDE AND WENT INTO SOME DESERT: EVEN SUPPOSING THEY WERE MERELY STRONG ASSES AND QUITE THE REVERSE OF A STRONG SPIRIT.

WHAT, THEN, IS THE MEANING OF THE ASCETIC IDEAL IN THE CASE OF A PHILOSOPHER? MY ANSWER IS‚ÄÎYOU WILL HAVE GUESSED IT LONG AGO: THE PHILOSOPHER SEES IN IT AN OPTIMUM CONDITION FOR THE HIGHEST AND BOLDEST SPIRITUALITY AND SMILES‚ÄÎHE DOES NOT DENY ‚ÄÚEXISTENCE,‚ÄÙ HE RATHER AFFIRMS HIS EXISTENCE AND ONLY HIS EXISTENCE, AND THIS PERHAPS TO THE POINT AT WHICH HE IS NOT FAR FROM HARBORING THE IMPIOUS WISH: PEREAT MUNDUS, FIAT PHILOSOPHIA, FIAT PHILOSOPHUS, FIAM!4‚ÄÎ

AS YOU SEE, THEY ARE NOT UNBIASED WITNESSES AND JUDGES OF THE VALUE OF THE ASCETIC IDEAL, THESE PHILOSOPHERS! THEY THINK OF THEMSELVES‚ÄÎWHAT IS ‚ÄÚTHE SAINT‚ÄÙ TO THEM! THEY THINK OF WHAT THEY CAN LEAST DO WITHOUT: FREEDOM FROM COMPULSION, DISTURBANCE, NOISE, FROM TASKS, DUTIES, WORRIES; CLEAR HEADS; THE DANCE, LEAP, AND FLIGHT OF IDEAS; GOOD AIR, THIN, CLEAR, OPEN, DRY, LIKE THE AIR OF THE HEIGHTS THROUGH WHICH ALL ANIMAL BEING BECOMES MORE SPIRITUAL AND ACQUIRES WINGS; REPOSE IN ALL CELLAR REGIONS; ALL DOGS NICELY CHAINED UP; NO BARKING OF HOSTILITY AND SHAGGY-HAIRED RANCOR; NO GNAWING WORM OF INJURED AMBITION; UNDEMANDING AND OBEDIENT INTESTINES, BUSY AS WINDMILLS BUT DISTANT; THE HEART REMOTE, BEYOND, HEAVY WITH FUTURE, POSTHUMOUS‚ÄÎALL IN ALL, THEY THINK OF THE ASCETIC IDEAL AS THE CHEERFUL ASCETICISM OF AN ANIMAL BECOME FLEDGED AND DIVINE, FLOATING ABOVE LIFE RATHER THAN IN REPOSE.

THE THREE GREAT SLOGANS OF THE ASCETIC IDEAL ARE FAMILIAR: POVERTY, HUMILITY, CHASTITY. NOW TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THE LIVES OF ALL THE GREAT, FRUITFUL, INVENTIVE SPIRITS: YOU WILL ALWAYS ENCOUNTER ALL THREE TO A CERTAIN DEGREE. NOT, IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING, AS THOUGH THESE CONSTITUTED THEIR ‚ÄÚVIRTUES‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWHAT HAS THIS KIND OF MAN TO DO WITH VIRTUES!‚ÄÎBUT AS THE MOST APPROPRIATE AND NATURAL CONDITIONS OF THEIR BEST EXISTENCE, THEIR FAIREST FRUITFULNESS. IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THEIR DOMINATING SPIRITUALITY HAD FIRST TO PUT A CHECK ON AN UNRESTRAINED AND IRRITABLE PRIDE OR A WANTON SENSUALITY, OR THAT IT PERHAPS HAD A HARD JOB TO MAINTAIN ITS WILL TO THE ‚ÄÚDESERT‚ÄÙ AGAINST A LOVE OF LUXURY AND REFINEMENT OR AN EXCESSIVE LIBERALITY OF HEART AND HAND. BUT IT DID IT, PRECISELY BECAUSE IT WAS THE DOMINATING INSTINCT WHOSE DEMANDS PREVAILED AGAINST THOSE OF ALL THE OTHER INSTINCTS‚ÄÎIT CONTINUES TO DO IT; IF IT DID NOT DO IT, IT WOULD NOT DOMINATE. THERE IS THUS NOTHING OF ‚ÄÚVIRTUE‚ÄÙ IN THIS.

THE DESERT, INCIDENTALLY, THAT I JUST MENTIONED, WHERE THE STRONG, INDEPENDENT SPIRITS WITHDRAW AND BECOME LONELY‚ÄÎOH, HOW DIFFERENT IT LOOKS FROM THE WAY EDUCATED PEOPLE IMAGINE A DESERT!‚ÄÎFOR IN SOME CASES THEY THEMSELVES ARE THIS DESERT, THESE EDUCATED PEOPLE. AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT NO ACTOR OF THE SPIRIT COULD POSSIBLY ENDURE LIFE IN IT‚ÄÎFOR THEM IT IS NOT NEARLY ROMANTIC OR SYRIAN ENOUGH, NOT NEARLY ENOUGH OF A STAGE DESERT! TO BE SURE, THERE IS NO LACK OF CAMELS1 IN IT; BUT THAT IS WHERE THE SIMILARITY ENDS. A VOLUNTARY OBSCURITY PERHAPS; AN AVOIDANCE OF ONESELF; A DISLIKE OF NOISE, HONOR, NEWSPAPERS, INFLUENCE; A MODEST JOB, AN EVERYDAY JOB, SOMETHING THAT CONCEALS RATHER THAN EXPOSES ONE; AN OCCASIONAL ASSOCIATION WITH HARMLESS, CHEERFUL BEASTS AND BIRDS WHOSE SIGHT IS REFRESHING; MOUNTAINS FOR COMPANY, BUT NOT DEAD ONES, MOUNTAINS WITH EYES (THAT IS, WITH LAKES); PERHAPS EVEN A ROOM IN A FULL, UTTERLY COMMONPLACE HOTEL, WHERE ONE IS CERTAIN TO GO UNRECOGNIZED AND CAN TALK TO ANYONE WITH IMPUNITY‚ÄÎTHAT IS WHAT ‚ÄÚDESERT‚ÄÙ MEANS HERE: OH, IT IS LONELY ENOUGH, BELIEVE ME! WHEN HERACLITUS WITHDREW INTO THE COURTYARDS AND COLONNADES OF THE GREAT TEMPLE OF ARTEMIS, THIS WAS A WORTHIER ‚ÄÚDESERT,‚ÄÙ I ADMIT: WHY DO WE LACK SUCH TEMPLES? (PERHAPS WE DO NOT LACK THEM: I JUST RECALL MY MOST BEAUTIFUL STUDY‚ÄÎTHE PIAZZA DI SAN MARCO, IN SPRING OF COURSE, AND MORNING ALSO, THE TIME BETWEEN TEN AND TWELVE.) THAT WHICH HERACLITUS AVOIDED, HOWEVER, IS STILL THE SAME AS THAT WHICH WE SHUN TODAY: THE NOISE AND DEMOCRATIC CHATTER OF THE EPHESIANS, THEIR POLITICS, THEIR LATEST NEWS OF THE ‚ÄÚEMPIRE‚ÄÙ2 (THE PERSIAN, YOU UNDERSTAND), THEIR MARKET BUSINESS OF ‚ÄÚTODAY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎFOR WE PHILOSOPHERS NEED TO BE SPARED ONE THING ABOVE ALL: EVERYTHING TO DO WITH ‚ÄÚTODAY.‚ÄÙ WE REVERENCE WHAT IS STILL, COLD, NOBLE, DISTANT, PAST, AND IN GENERAL EVERYTHING IN THE FACE OF WHICH THE SOUL DOES NOT HAVE TO DEFEND ITSELF AND WRAP ITSELF UP‚ÄÎWHAT ONE CAN SPEAK TO WITHOUT SPEAKING ALOUD.

ONE SHOULD LISTEN TO HOW A SPIRIT SOUNDS WHEN IT SPEAKS: EVERY SPIRIT HAS ITS OWN SOUND AND LOVES ITS OWN SOUND. THAT ONE, OVER THERE, FOR EXAMPLE, MUST BE AN AGITATOR, THAT IS TO SAY, A HOLLOW HEAD, A HOLLOW POT: WHATEVER GOES INTO HIM COMES BACK OUT OF HIM DULL AND THICK, HEAVY WITH THE ECHO OF GREAT EMPTINESS. THIS FELLOW USUALLY SPEAKS HOARSELY: HAS HE PERHAPS THOUGHT HIMSELF HOARSE? THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE‚ÄÎASK ANY PHYSIOLOGIST‚ÄÎBUT WHOEVER THINKS IN WORDS THINKS AS AN ORATOR AND NOT AS A THINKER (IT SHOWS THAT FUNDAMENTALLY HE DOES NOT THINK FACTS, NOR FACTUALLY, BUT ONLY IN RELATION TO FACTS; THAT HE IS REALLY THINKING OF HIMSELF AND HIS LISTENERS). A THIRD PERSON SPEAKS IMPORTUNATELY, HE COMES TOO CLOSE TO US, HE BREATHES ON US‚ÄÎINVOLUNTARILY WE CLOSE OUR MOUTHS, ALTHOUGH IT IS A BOOK THROUGH WHICH HE IS SPEAKING TO US: THE SOUND OF HIS STYLE BETRAYS THE REASON: HE HAS NO TIME TO WASTE, HE HAS LITTLE FAITH IN HIMSELF, HE MUST SPEAK TODAY OR NEVER. A SPIRIT THAT IS SURE OF ITSELF, HOWEVER, SPEAKS SOFTLY; IT SEEKS CONCEALMENT, IT KEEPS PEOPLE WAITING.

A PHILOSOPHER MAY BE RECOGNIZED BY THE FACT THAT HE AVOIDS THREE GLITTERING AND LOUD THINGS: FAME, PRINCES, AND WOMEN‚ÄÎWHICH IS NOT TO SAY THEY DO NOT COME TO HIM. HE SHUNS LIGHT THAT IS TOO BRIGHT: THAT IS WHY HE SHUNS HIS AGE AND ITS ‚ÄÚDAY.‚ÄÙ IN THIS HE IS LIKE A SHADOW: THE LOWER HIS SUN SINKS THE BIGGER HE BECOMES. AS FOR HIS ‚ÄÚHUMILITY,‚ÄÙ HE ENDURES A CERTAIN DEPENDENCE AND ECLIPSE, AS HE ENDURES THE DARKNESS: MORE, HE IS AFRAID OF BEING DISTRACTED BY LIGHTNING, HE SHIES AWAY FROM THE UNPROTECTED ISOLATION OF ABANDONED TREES UPON WHICH ANY BAD WEATHER CAN VENT ITS MOODS, ANY MOOD ITS BAD WEATHER. HIS ‚ÄÚMATERNAL‚ÄÙ INSTINCT, THE SECRET LOVE OF THAT WHICH IS GROWING IN HIM, DIRECTS HIM TOWARD SITUATIONS IN WHICH HE IS RELIEVED OF THE NECESSITY OF THINKING OF HIMSELF; IN THE SAME SENSE IN WHICH THE INSTINCT OF THE MOTHER IN WOMAN HAS HITHERTO GENERALLY KEPT WOMAN IN A DEPENDENT SITUATION. ULTIMATELY THEY ASK FOR LITTLE ENOUGH, THESE PHILOSOPHERS: THEIR MOTTO IS ‚ÄÚHE WHO POSSESSES IS POSSESSED‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎNOT, AS I MUST SAY AGAIN AND AGAIN, FROM VIRTUE, FROM A LAUDABLE WILL TO CONTENTMENT AND SIMPLICITY, BUT BECAUSE THEIR SUPREME LORD DEMANDS THIS OF THEM, PRUDENTLY AND INEXORABLY: HE IS CONCERNED WITH ONE THING ALONE, AND ASSEMBLES AND SAVES UP EVERYTHING‚ÄÎTIME, ENERGY, LOVE, AND INTEREST‚ÄÎONLY FOR THAT ONE THING.

THIS KIND OF MAN DOES NOT LIKE TO BE DISTURBED BY ENMITIES, NOR BY FRIENDSHIPS; HE EASILY FORGETS AND EASILY DESPISES. HE THINKS IT IN BAD TASTE TO PLAY THE MARTYR; ‚ÄÚTO SUFFER FOR TRUTH‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHE LEAVES THAT TO THE AMBITIOUS AND THE STAGE HEROES OF THE SPIRIT AND TO ANYONE ELSE WHO HAS THE TIME FOR IT (THE PHILOSOPHERS THEMSELVES HAVE SOMETHING TO DO FOR THE TRUTH). THEY USE BIG WORDS SPARINGLY; IT IS SAID THAT THEY DISLIKE THE VERY WORD ‚ÄÚTRUTH‚ÄÙ: IT SOUNDS TOO GRANDILOQUENT.

AS FOR THE ‚ÄÚCHASTITY‚ÄÙ OF PHILOSOPHERS, FINALLY, THIS TYPE OF SPIRIT CLEARLY HAS ITS FRUITFULNESS SOMEWHERE ELSE THAN IN CHILDREN; PERHAPS IT ALSO HAS THE SURVIVAL OF ITS NAME ELSEWHERE, ITS LITTLE IMMORTALITY (PHILOSOPHERS IN ANCIENT INDIA EXPRESSED THEMSELVES EVEN MORE IMMODESTLY: ‚ÄÚWHY SHOULD HE DESIRE PROGENY WHOSE SOUL IS THE WORLD?‚ÄÙ). THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS OF CHASTITY FROM ANY KIND OF ASCETIC SCRUPLE OR HATRED OF THE SENSES, JUST AS IT IS NOT CHASTITY WHEN AN ATHLETE OR JOCKEY ABSTAINS FROM WOMEN: IT IS RATHER THE WILL OF THEIR DOMINATING INSTINCT, AT LEAST DURING THEIR PERIODS OF GREAT PREGNANCY. EVERY ARTIST KNOWS WHAT A HARMFUL EFFECT INTERCOURSE HAS IN STATES OF GREAT SPIRITUAL TENSION AND PREPARATION; THOSE WITH THE GREATEST POWER AND THE SUREST INSTINCTS DO NOT NEED TO LEARN THIS BY EXPERIENCE, BY UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE‚ÄÎTHEIR ‚ÄÚMATERNAL‚ÄÙ INSTINCT RUTHLESSLY DISPOSES OF ALL OTHER STORES AND ACCUMULATIONS OF ENERGY, OF ANIMAL VIGOR, FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE EVOLVING WORK: THE GREATER ENERGY THEN USES UP THE LESSER.

NOW LET US INTERPRET THE CASE OF SCHOPENHAUER, DISCUSSED ABOVE, IN THE LIGHT OF THESE REMARKS: THE SIGHT OF THE BEAUTIFUL OBVIOUSLY HAD UPON HIM THE EFFECT OF RELEASING THE CHIEF ENERGY OF HIS NATURE (THE ENERGY OF CONTEMPLATION AND PENETRATION), SO THAT THIS EXPLODED AND ALL AT ONCE BECAME THE MASTER OF HIS CONSCIOUSNESS. THIS SHOULD BY NO MEANS PRECLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SWEETNESS AND PLENITUDE PECULIAR TO THE AESTHETIC STATE MIGHT BE DERIVED PRECISELY FROM THE INGREDIENT OF ‚ÄÚSENSUALITY‚ÄÙ (JUST AS THE ‚ÄÚIDEALISM‚ÄÙ OF ADOLESCENT GIRLS DERIVES FROM THIS SOURCE)‚ÄÎSO THAT SENSUALITY IS NOT OVERCOME BY THE APPEARANCE OF THE AESTHETIC CONDITION, AS SCHOPENHAUER BELIEVED, BUT ONLY TRANSFIGURED AND NO LONGER ENTERS CONSCIOUSNESS AS SEXUAL EXCITEMENT. (I SHALL RETURN TO THIS POINT ON ANOTHER OCCASION, IN CONNECTION WITH THE STILL MORE DELICATE PROBLEMS OF THE PHYSIOLOGY OF AESTHETICS,3 WHICH IS PRACTICALLY UNTOUCHED AND UNEXPLORED SO FAR.)

WE HAVE SEEN HOW A CERTAIN ASCETICISM, A SEVERE AND CHEERFUL CONTINENCE WITH THE BEST WILL, BELONGS TO THE MOST FAVORABLE CONDITIONS OF SUPREME SPIRITUALITY, AND IS ALSO AMONG ITS MOST NATURAL CONSEQUENCES: HENCE IT NEED BE NO MATTER FOR SURPRISE THAT PHILOSOPHERS HAVE ALWAYS DISCUSSED THE ASCETIC IDEAL WITH A CERTAIN FONDNESS. A SERIOUS EXAMINATION OF HISTORY ACTUALLY REVEALS THAT THE BOND BETWEEN PHILOSOPHY AND THE ASCETIC IDEAL IS EVEN MUCH CLOSER AND STRONGER. ONE MIGHT ASSERT THAT IT WAS ONLY ON THE LEADING-STRINGS OF THIS IDEAL THAT PHILOSOPHY LEARNED TO TAKE ITS FIRST SMALL STEPS ON EARTH‚ÄÎALAS, SO CLUMSILY, SO UNWILLINGLY, SO READY TO FALL ON ITS FACE AND LIE ON ITS BELLY, THIS TIMID LITTLE TODDLER AND MOLLYCODDLE WITH SHAKY LEGS!

PHILOSOPHY BEGAN AS ALL GOOD THINGS BEGIN: FOR A LONG TIME IT LACKED THE COURAGE FOR ITSELF; IT WAS ALWAYS LOOKING ROUND TO SEE IF SOMEONE WOULD COME AND HELP IT; YET IT WAS AFRAID OF ALL WHO LOOKED AT IT. DRAW UP A LIST OF THE VARIOUS PROPENSITIES AND VIRTUES OF THE PHILOSOPHER‚ÄÎHIS BENT TO DOUBT, HIS BENT TO DENY, HIS BENT TO SUSPEND JUDGMENT (HIS ‚ÄÚEPHECTIC‚ÄÙ BENT), HIS BENT TO ANALYZE, HIS BENT TO INVESTIGATE, SEEK, DARE, HIS BENT TO COMPARE AND BALANCE, HIS WILL TO NEUTRALITY AND OBJECTIVITY, HIS WILL TO EVERY ‚ÄÚSINE IRA ET STUDIO‚ÄÙ:1 IS IT NOT CLEAR THAT FOR THE LONGEST TIME ALL OF THEM CONTRAVENED THE BASIC DEMANDS OF MORALITY AND CONSCIENCE (NOT TO SPEAK OF REASON QUITE GENERALLY, WHICH LUTHER LIKED TO CALL ‚ÄÚMISTRESS CLEVER, THE CLEVER WHORE‚ÄÙ)‚ÄÎTHAT IF A PHILOSOPHER HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF WHAT HE WAS, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO FEEL HIMSELF THE EMBODIMENT OF ‚ÄÚNITIMUR IN VETITUM‚ÄÙ2‚ÄÎAND CONSEQUENTLY GUARDED AGAINST ‚ÄÚFEELING HIMSELF,‚ÄÙ AGAINST BECOMING CONSCIOUS OF HIMSELF?

IT IS, TO REPEAT, NO DIFFERENT WITH ALL THE GOOD THINGS OF WHICH WE ARE PROUD TODAY; MEASURED EVEN BY THE STANDARDS OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS, OUR ENTIRE MODERN WAY OF LIFE, INSOFAR AS IT IS NOT WEAKNESS BUT POWER AND CONSCIOUSNESS OF POWER, HAS THE APPEARANCE OF SHEER HUBRIS3 AND GODLESSNESS: FOR THE LONGEST TIME IT WAS PRECISELY THE REVERSE OF THOSE THINGS WE HOLD IN HONOR TODAY THAT HAD A GOOD CONSCIENCE ON ITS SIDE AND GOD FOR ITS GUARDIAN. OUR WHOLE ATTITUDE TOWARD NATURE, THE WAY WE VIOLATE HER WITH THE AID OF MACHINES AND THE HEEDLESS INVENTIVENESS OF OUR TECHNICIANS AND ENGINEERS, IS HUBRIS; OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD GOD AS SOME ALLEGED SPIDER OF PURPOSE AND MORALITY BEHIND THE GREAT CAPTIOUS WEB OF CAUSALITY, IS HUBRIS‚ÄÎWE MIGHT SAY, WITH CHARLES THE BOLD WHEN HE OPPOSED LOUIS XI, ‚ÄÚJE COMBATS L‚ÄÔUNIVERSELLE ARAIGN√©E‚ÄÙ;,4 OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD OURSELVES IS HUBRIS, FOR WE EXPERIMENT WITH OURSELVES IN A WAY WE WOULD NEVER PERMIT OURSELVES TO EXPERIMENT WITH ANIMALS AND, CARRIED AWAY BY CURIOSITY, WE CHEERFULLY VIVISECT OUR SOULS: WHAT IS THE ‚ÄÚSALVATION‚ÄÙ OF THE SOUL TO US TODAY? AFTERWARD WE CURE OURSELVES: SICKNESS IS INSTRUCTIVE, WE HAVE NO DOUBT OF THAT, EVEN MORE INSTRUCTIVE THAN HEALTH‚ÄÎTHOSE WHO MAKE SICK SEEM EVEN MORE NECESSARY TO US TODAY THAN ANY MEDICINE MEN OR ‚ÄÚSAVIORS.‚ÄÙ WE VIOLATE OURSELVES NOWADAYS, NO DOUBT OF IT, WE NUTCRACKERS OF THE SOUL, EVER QUESTIONING AND QUESTIONABLE, AS IF LIFE WERE NOTHING BUT CRACKING NUTS; AND THUS WE ARE BOUND TO GROW DAY-BY-DAY MORE QUESTIONABLE, WORTHIER OF ASKING QUESTIONS;5 PERHAPS ALSO WORTHIER‚ÄÎOF LIVING?

ALL GOOD THINGS WERE FORMERLY BAD THINGS; EVERY ORIGINAL SIN HAS TURNED INTO AN ORIGINAL VIRTUE. MARRIAGE, FOR EXAMPLE, SEEMED FOR A LONG TIME A TRANSGRESSION AGAINST THE RIGHTS OF THE COMMUNITY; ONE HAD TO MAKE REPARATION FOR BEING SO IMMODEST AS TO CLAIM A WOMAN FOR ONESELF (HENCE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS?6, WHICH IN CAMBODIA IS STILL THE PREROGATIVE OF THE PRIESTS, THOSE GUARDIANS OF ALL ‚ÄÚHALLOWED CUSTOMS‚ÄÙ). THE GENTLE, BENEVOLENT, CONCILIATORY, AND COMPASSIONATE FEELINGS‚ÄÎEVENTUALLY SO HIGHLY VALUED THAT THEY ALMOST CONSTITUTE ‚ÄÚTHE ETERNAL VALUES‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWERE OPPOSED FOR THE LONGEST TIME BY SELF-CONTEMPT: ONE WAS ASHAMED OF MILDNESS AS ONE IS TODAY ASHAMED OF HARDNESS (CF. BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, SECTION 260). SUBMISSION TO LAW: HOW THE CONSCIENCES OF NOBLE TRIBES ALL OVER THE EARTH RESISTED THE ABANDONMENT OF VENDETTA AND WERE LOATH TO BOW BEFORE THE POWER OF THE LAW! ‚ÄÚLAW‚ÄÙ WAS FOR A LONG TIME A VETITUM,7 AN OUTRAGE, AN INNOVATION; IT WAS CHARACTERIZED BY VIOLENCE‚ÄÎIT WAS VIOLENCE TO WHICH ONE SUBMITTED, FEELING ASHAMED OF ONESELF. EVERY SMALLEST STEP ON EARTH HAS BEEN PAID FOR BY SPIRITUAL AND PHYSICAL TORTURE: THIS WHOLE POINT OF VIEW, ‚ÄÚTHAT NOT ONLY EVERY PROGRESSIVE STEP, NO! EVERY STEP, MOVEMENT, AND CHANGE HAS REQUIRED ITS COUNTLESS MARTYRS,‚ÄÙ SOUNDS UTTERLY STRANGE TO US TODAY‚ÄÎI CALLED ATTENTION TO IT IN THE DAWN, SECTION 18.

‚ÄÚNOTHING HAS BEEN BOUGHT MORE DEARLY,‚ÄÙ I SAY THERE, ‚ÄÚTHAN THE MODICUM OF HUMAN REASON AND FEELING OF FREEDOM THAT ARE NOW OUR PRIDE. IT IS THIS PRIDE, HOWEVER, THAT MAKES IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TODAY TO EMPATHIZE WITH THAT VAST ERA OF THE ‚ÄÒMORALITY OF MORES‚ÄÔ8 WHICH PRECEDED ‚ÄÒWORLD HISTORY‚ÄÔ AS THE TRULY DECISIVE HISTORY THAT DETERMINED THE CHARACTER OF MANKIND: WHEN SUFFERING WAS EVERYWHERE COUNTED AS A VIRTUE, CRUELTY AS A VIRTUE, DISSEMBLING AS A VIRTUE, REVENGE AS A VIRTUE, SLANDER OF REASON AS A VIRTUE, AND WHEN ON THE OTHER HAND WELL-BEING WAS COUNTED AS A DANGER, THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE AS A DANGER, PEACE AS A DANGER, PITY AS A DANGER, BEING PITIED AS A DISGRACE, WORK AS A DISGRACE, MADNESS AS DIVINE, CHANGE AS THE VERY ESSENCE OF IMMORALITY9 AND PREGNANT WITH DISASTER.‚ÄÙ

IN THE SAME BOOK (SECTION 42) IT IS EXPLAINED UNDER WHAT VALUATION, WHAT OPPRESSION OF VALUATION, THE EARLIEST RACE OF CONTEMPLATIVE MEN HAD TO LIVE: WHEN NOT FEARED, THEY WERE DESPISED. CONTEMPLATION FIRST APPEARED ON EARTH IN DISGUISE, IN AMBIGUOUS FORM, WITH AN EVIL HEART AND OFTEN AN ANXIOUS HEAD: THERE IS NO DOUBT OF THAT. THE INACTIVE, BROODING, UNWARLIKE ELEMENT IN THE INSTINCTS OF CONTEMPLATIVE MEN LONG SURROUNDED THEM WITH A PROFOUND MISTRUSTFULNESS: THE ONLY WAY OF DISPELLING IT WAS TO AROUSE A DECIDED FEAR OF ONESELF. AND THE ANCIENT BRAHMINS, FOR INSTANCE, KNEW HOW TO DO THIS! THE EARLIEST PHILOSOPHERS KNEW HOW TO ENDOW THEIR EXISTENCE AND APPEARANCE WITH A MEANING, A BASIS AND BACKGROUND, THROUGH WHICH OTHERS MIGHT COME TO FEAR THEM: MORE CLOSELY CONSIDERED, THEY DID SO FROM AN EVEN MORE FUNDAMENTAL NEED, NAMELY, SO AS TO FEAR AND REVERENCE THEMSELVES. FOR THEY FOUND ALL THE VALUE JUDGMENTS WITHIN THEM TURNED AGAINST THEM, THEY HAD TO FIGHT DOWN EVERY KIND OF SUSPICION AND RESISTANCE AGAINST ‚ÄÚTHE PHILOSOPHER IN THEM,‚ÄÙ AS MEN OF FRIGHTFUL AGES, THEY DID THIS BY USING FRIGHTFUL MEANS: CRUELTY TOWARD THEMSELVES, INVENTIVE SELF-CASTIGATION‚ÄÎTHIS WAS THE PRINCIPAL MEANS THESE POWER-HUNGRY HERMITS AND INNOVATORS OF IDEAS REQUIRED TO OVERCOME THE GODS AND TRADITION IN THEMSELVES, SO AS TO BE ABLE TO BELIEVE IN THEIR OWN INNOVATIONS. I RECALL THE FAMOUS STORY OF KING VISHVAMITRA, WHO THROUGH MILLENNIA OF SELF-TORTURE ACQUIRED SUCH A FEELING OF POWER AND SELF-CONFIDENCE THAT HE ENDEAVORED TO BUILD A NEW HEAVEN‚ÄÎTHE UNCANNY SYMBOL OF THE MOST ANCIENT AND MOST RECENT EXPERIENCE OF PHILOSOPHERS ON EARTH: WHOEVER HAS AT SOME TIME BUILT A ‚ÄÚNEW HEAVEN‚ÄÙ HAS FOUND THE POWER TO DO SO ONLY IN HIS OWN HELL.

LET US COMPRESS THE FACTS INTO A FEW BRIEF FORMULAS: TO BEGIN WITH, THE PHILOSOPHIC SPIRIT ALWAYS HAD TO USE AS A MASK AND COCOON THE PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED TYPES OF THE CONTEMPLATIVE MAN‚ÄÎPRIEST, SORCERER, SOOTHSAYER, AND IN ANY CASE A RELIGIOUS TYPE‚ÄÎIN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO EXIST AT ALL: THE ASCETIC IDEAL FOR A LONG TIME SERVED THE PHILOSOPHER AS A FORM IN WHICH TO APPEAR, AS A PRECONDITION OF EXISTENCE‚ÄÎHE HAD TO REPRESENT IT SO AS TO BE ABLE TO BE A PHILOSOPHER; HE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT IT. THE PECULIAR, WITHDRAWN ATTITUDE OF THE PHILOSOPHER, WORLD-DENYING, HOSTILE TO LIFE, SUSPICIOUS OF THE SENSES, FREED FROM SENSUALITY, WHICH HAS BEEN MAINTAINED DOWN TO THE MOST MODERN TIMES AND HAS BECOME VIRTUALLY THE PHILOSOPHER‚ÄÔS POSE PAR EXCELLENCE‚ÄÎIT IS ABOVE ALL A RESULT OF THE EMERGENCY CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH PHILOSOPHY AROSE AND SURVIVED AT ALL; FOR THE LONGEST TIME PHILOSOPHY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE AT ALL ON EARTH WITHOUT ASCETIC WRAPS AND CLOAK, WITHOUT AN ASCETIC SELF-MISUNDERSTANDING. TO PUT IT VIVIDLY: THE ASCETIC PRIEST PROVIDED UNTIL THE MOST MODERN TIMES THE REPULSIVE AND GLOOMY CATERPILLAR FORM IN WHICH ALONE THE PHILOSOPHER COULD LIVE AND CREEP ABOUT.

HAS ALL THIS REALLY ALTERED? HAS THAT MANY-COLORED AND DANGEROUS WINGED CREATURE, THE ‚ÄÚSPIRIT‚ÄÙ WHICH THIS CATERPILLAR CONCEALED, REALLY BEEN UNFETTERED AT LAST AND RELEASED INTO THE LIGHT, THANKS TO A SUNNIER, WARMER, BRIGHTER WORLD? IS THERE SUFFICIENT PRIDE, DARING, COURAGE, SELF-CONFIDENCE AVAILABLE TODAY, SUFFICIENT WILL OF THE SPIRIT, WILL TO RESPONSIBILITY, FREEDOM OF WILL, FOR ‚ÄÚTHE PHILOSOPHER‚ÄÙ TO BE HENCEFORTH‚ÄÎPOSSIBLE ON EARTH?‚ÄÎ





11


ONLY NOW THAT WE BEHOLD THE ASCETIC PRIEST DO WE SERIOUSLY COME TO GRIPS WITH OUR PROBLEM: WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE ASCETIC IDEAL?‚ÄÎONLY NOW DOES IT BECOME ‚ÄÚSERIOUS‚ÄÙ: WE ARE NOW FACE TO FACE WITH THE ACTUAL REPRESENTATIVE OF SERIOUSNESS. ‚ÄÚWHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL SERIOUSNESS?‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHIS EVEN MORE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION MAY PERHAPS BE TREMBLING ON OUR LIPS AT THIS POINT: A QUESTION FOR PHYSIOLOGISTS, OF COURSE, BUT ONE WHICH WE MUST STILL AVOID FOR THE MOMENT. THE ASCETIC PRIEST POSSESSED IN THIS IDEAL NOT ONLY HIS FAITH BUT ALSO HIS WILL, HIS POWER, HIS INTEREST. HIS RIGHT TO EXIST STANDS OR FALLS WITH THAT IDEAL: NO WONDER WE ENCOUNTER HERE A TERRIBLE ANTAGONIST‚ÄÎSUPPOSING WE ARE ANTAGONISTS OF THAT IDEAL‚ÄÎONE WHO FIGHTS FOR HIS EXISTENCE AGAINST THOSE WHO DENY THAT IDEAL.

ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS INHERENTLY IMPROBABLE THAT SO INTERESTED AN ATTITUDE TOWARD OUR PROBLEM WILL BENEFIT IT: THE ASCETIC PRIEST WILL HARDLY PROVIDE THE BEST DEFENSE OF HIS IDEAL, JUST AS A WOMAN WHO TRIES TO DEFEND ‚ÄÚWOMAN AS SUCH‚ÄÙ USUALLY FAILS‚ÄÎAND HE CERTAINLY WILL NOT BE THE MOST OBJECTIVE JUDGE OF THIS CONTROVERSY. FAR FROM FEARING HE WILL CONFUTE US‚ÄÎTHIS MUCH IS ALREADY OBVIOUS‚ÄÎWE SHALL HAVE TO HELP HIM DEFEND HIMSELF AGAINST US.

THE IDEA AT ISSUE HERE IS THE VALUATION THE ASCETIC PRIEST PLACES ON OUR LIFE: HE JUXTAPOSES IT (ALONG WITH WHAT PERTAINS TO IT: ‚ÄÚNATURE,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚWORLD,‚ÄÙ THE WHOLE SPHERE OF BECOMING AND TRANSITORINESS) WITH A QUITE DIFFERENT MODE OF EXISTENCE WHICH IT OPPOSES AND EXCLUDES, UNLESS IT TURN AGAINST ITSELF, DENY ITSELF: IN THAT CASE, THE CASE OF THE ASCETIC LIFE, LIFE COUNTS AS A BRIDGE TO THAT OTHER MODE OF EXISTENCE. THE ASCETIC TREATS LIFE AS A WRONG ROAD ON WHICH ONE MUST FINALLY WALK BACK TO THE POINT WHERE IT BEGINS, OR AS A MISTAKE THAT IS PUT RIGHT BY DEEDS‚ÄÎTHAT WE OUGHT TO PUT RIGHT: FOR HE DEMANDS THAT ONE GO ALONG WITH HIM; WHERE HE CAN HE COMPELS ACCEPTANCE OF HIS EVALUATION OF EXISTENCE.

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? SO MONSTROUS A MODE OF VALUATION STANDS INSCRIBED IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND NOT AS AN EXCEPTION AND CURIOSITY, BUT AS ONE OF THE MOST WIDESPREAD AND ENDURING OF ALL PHENOMENA. READ FROM A DISTANT STAR, THE MAJUSCULE SCRIPT OF OUR EARTHLY EXISTENCE WOULD PERHAPS LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE EARTH WAS THE DISTINCTIVELY ASCETIC PLANET, A NOOK OF DISGRUNTLED, ARROGANT, AND OFFENSIVE CREATURES FILLED WITH A PROFOUND DISGUST AT THEMSELVES, AT THE EARTH, AT ALL LIFE, WHO INFLICT AS MUCH PAIN ON THEMSELVES AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN OUT OF PLEASURE IN INFLICTING PAIN‚ÄÎWHICH IS PROBABLY THEIR ONLY PLEASURE. FOR CONSIDER HOW REGULARLY AND UNIVERSALLY THE ASCETIC PRIEST APPEARS IN ALMOST EVERY AGE; HE BELONGS TO NO ONE RACE; HE PROSPERS EVERYWHERE; HE EMERGES FROM EVERY CLASS OF SOCIETY. NOR DOES HE BREED AND PROPAGATE HIS MODE OF VALUATION THROUGH HEREDITY: THE OPPOSITE IS THE CASE‚ÄÎBROADLY SPEAKING, A PROFOUND INSTINCT RATHER FORBIDS HIM TO PROPAGATE. IT MUST BE A NECESSITY OF THE FIRST ORDER THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN PROMOTES THE GROWTH AND PROSPERITY OF THIS LIFE-INIMICAL SPECIES‚ÄÎIT MUST INDEED BE IN THE INTEREST OF LIFE ITSELF THAT SUCH A SELF-CONTRADICTORY TYPE DOES NOT DIE OUT. FOR AN ASCETIC LIFE IS A SELF-CONTRADICTION: HERE RULES A RESSENTIMENT WITHOUT EQUAL, THAT OF AN INSATIABLE INSTINCT AND POWER-WILL THAT WANTS TO BECOME MASTER NOT OVER SOMETHING IN LIFE BUT OVER LIFE ITSELF, OVER ITS MOST PROFOUND, POWERFUL, AND BASIC CONDITIONS; HERE AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO EMPLOY FORCE TO BLOCK UP THE WELLS OF FORCE; HERE PHYSIOLOGICAL WELL-BEING ITSELF IS VIEWED ASKANCE, AND ESPECIALLY THE OUTWARD EXPRESSION OF THIS WELL-BEING, BEAUTY AND JOY; WHILE PLEASURE IS FELT AND SOUGHT IN ILL‚ÄÎCONSTITUTEDNESS, DECAY, PAIN, MISCHANCE, UGLINESS, VOLUNTARY DEPRIVATION, SELF-MORTIFICATION, SELF-FLAGELLATION, SELF-SACRIFICE. ALL THIS IS IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE PARADOXICAL: WE STAND BEFORE A DISCORD THAT WANTS TO BE DISCORDANT, THAT ENJOYS ITSELF IN THIS SUFFERING AND EVEN GROWS MORE SELF-CONFIDENT AND TRIUMPHANT THE MORE ITS OWN PRESUPPOSITION, ITS PHYSIOLOGICAL CAPACITY FOR LIFE, DECREASES, ‚ÄÚTRIUMPH IN THE ULTIMATE AGONY‚ÄÙ: THE ASCETIC IDEAL HAS ALWAYS FOUGHT UNDER THIS HYPERBOLIC SIGN; IN THIS ENIGMA OF SEDUCTION, IN THIS IMAGE OF TORMENT AND DELIGHT, IT RECOGNIZED ITS BRIGHTEST LIGHT, ITS SALVATION, ITS ULTIMATE VICTORY. CRUX, NUX, LUX1‚ÄÎFOR THE ASCETIC IDEAL THESE THREE ARE ONE.‚ÄÎ

SUPPOSE SUCH AN INCARNATE WILL TO CONTRADICTION AND ANTINATURALNESS IS INDUCED TO PHILOSOPHIZE: UPON WHAT WILL IT VENT ITS INNERMOST CONTRARINESS? UPON WHAT IS FELT MOST CERTAINLY TO BE REAL AND ACTUAL: IT WILL LOOK FOR ERROR PRECISELY WHERE THE INSTINCT OF LIFE MOST UNCONDITIONALLY POSITS TRUTH. IT WILL, FOR EXAMPLE, LIKE THE ASCETICS OF THE VEDANTA PHILOSOPHY, DOWNGRADE PHYSICALITY TO AN ILLUSION; LIKEWISE PAIN, MULTIPLICITY, THE ENTIRE CONCEPTUAL ANTITHESIS ‚ÄÚSUBJECT‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚOBJECT‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎERRORS, NOTHING BUT ERRORS! TO RENOUNCE BELIEF IN ONE‚ÄÔS EGO, TO DENY ONE‚ÄÔS OWN ‚ÄÚREALITY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWHAT A TRIUMPH! NOT MERELY OVER THE SENSES, OVER APPEARANCE, BUT A MUCH HIGHER KIND OF TRIUMPH, A VIOLATION AND CRUELTY AGAINST REASON‚ÄÎA VOLUPTUOUS PLEASURE THAT REACHES ITS HEIGHT WHEN THE ASCETIC SELF-CONTEMPT AND SELF-MOCKERY OF REASON DECLARES: ‚ÄÚTHERE IS A REALM OF TRUTH AND BEING, BUT REASON IS EXCLUDED FROM IT!‚ÄÙ

(INCIDENTALLY, EVEN IN THE KANTIAN CONCEPT OF THE ‚ÄÚINTELLIGIBLE CHARACTER OF THINGS‚ÄÙ SOMETHING REMAINS OF THIS LASCIVIOUS ASCETIC DISCORD THAT LOVES TO TURN REASON AGAINST REASON: FOR ‚ÄÚINTELLIGIBLE CHARACTER‚ÄÙ SIGNIFIES IN KANT THAT THINGS ARE SO CONSTITUTED THAT THE INTELLECT COMPREHENDS JUST ENOUGH OF THEM TO KNOW THAT FOR THE INTELLECT THEY ARE‚ÄÎUTTERLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE.)

BUT PRECISELY BECAUSE WE SEEK KNOWLEDGE, LET US NOT BE UNGRATEFUL TO SUCH RESOLUTE REVERSALS OF ACCUSTOMED PERSPECTIVES AND VALUATIONS WITH WHICH THE SPIRIT HAS, WITH APPARENT MISCHIEVOUSNESS AND FUTILITY, RAGED AGAINST ITSELF FOR SO LONG: TO SEE DIFFERENTLY IN THIS WAY FOR ONCE, TO WANT TO SEE DIFFERENTLY, IS NO SMALL DISCIPLINE AND PREPARATION OF THE INTELLECT FOR ITS FUTURE ‚ÄÚOBJECTIVITY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHE LATTER UNDERSTOOD NOT AS ‚ÄÚCONTEMPLATION WITHOUT INTEREST‚ÄÙ (WHICH IS A NONSENSICAL ABSURDITY), BUT AS THE ABILITY TO CONTROL ONE‚ÄÔS PRO AND CON AND TO DISPOSE OF THEM, SO THAT ONE KNOWS HOW TO EMPLOY A VARIETY OF PERSPECTIVES AND AFFECTIVE INTERPRETATIONS IN THE SERVICE OF KNOWLEDGE.

HENCEFORTH, MY DEAR PHILOSOPHERS, LET US BE ON GUARD AGAINST THE DANGEROUS OLD CONCEPTUAL FICTION THAT POSITED A ‚ÄÚPURE, WILL-LESS, PAINLESS, TIMELESS KNOWING SUBJECT;‚ÄÙ LET US GUARD AGAINST THE SNARES OF SUCH CONTRADICTORY CONCEPTS AS ‚ÄÚPURE REASON,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚABSOLUTE SPIRITUALITY,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚKNOWLEDGE IN ITSELF‚ÄÙ: THESE ALWAYS DEMAND THAT WE SHOULD THINK OF AN EYE THAT IS COMPLETELY UNTHINKABLE, AN EYE TURNED IN NO PARTICULAR DIRECTION, IN WHICH THE ACTIVE AND INTERPRETING FORCES, THROUGH WHICH ALONE SEEING BECOMES SEEING SOMETHING, ARE SUPPOSED TO BE LACKING; THESE ALWAYS DEMAND OF THE EYE AN ABSURDITY AND A NONSENSE. THERE IS ONLY A PERSPECTIVE SEEING, ONLY A PERSPECTIVE ‚ÄÚKNOWING;‚ÄÙ AND THE MORE AFFECTS WE ALLOW TO SPEAK ABOUT ONE THING, THE MORE EYES, DIFFERENT EYES, WE CAN USE TO OBSERVE ONE THING, THE MORE COMPLETE WILL OUR ‚ÄÚCONCEPT‚ÄÙ OF THIS THING, OUR ‚ÄÚOBJECTIVITY,‚ÄÙ BE.1 BUT TO ELIMINATE THE WILL ALTOGETHER, TO SUSPEND EACH AND EVERY AFFECT, SUPPOSING WE WERE CAPABLE OF THIS‚ÄÎWHAT WOULD THAT MEAN BUT TO CASTRATE THE INTELLECT?‚ÄÎ

BUT LET US RETURN TO OUR PROBLEM. IT WILL BE IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS THAT SUCH A SELF-CONTRADICTION AS THE ASCETIC APPEARS TO REPRESENT, ‚ÄÚLIFE AGAINST LIFE,‚ÄÙ IS, PHYSIOLOGICALLY CONSIDERED AND NOT MERELY PSYCHOLOGICALLY, A SIMPLE ABSURDITY. IT CAN ONLY BE APPARENT; IT MUST BE A KIND OF PROVISIONAL FORMULATION, AN INTERPRETATION AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MISUNDERSTANDING OF SOMETHING WHOSE REAL NATURE COULD NOT FOR A LONG TIME BE UNDERSTOOD OR DESCRIBED AS IT REALLY WAS‚ÄÎA MERE WORD INSERTED INTO AN OLD GAP IN HUMAN KNOWLEDGE. LET US REPLACE IT WITH A BRIEF FORMULATION OF THE FACTS OF THE MATTER: THE ASCETIC IDEAL SPRINGS FROM THE PROTECTIVE INSTINCT OF A DEGENERATING LIFE WHICH TRIES BY ALL MEANS TO SUSTAIN ITSELF AND TO FIGHT FOR ITS EXISTENCE; IT INDICATES A PARTIAL PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSTRUCTION AND EXHAUSTION AGAINST WHICH THE DEEPEST INSTINCTS OF LIFE, WHICH HAVE REMAINED INTACT, CONTINUALLY STRUGGLE WITH NEW EXPEDIENTS AND DEVICES. THE ASCETIC IDEAL IS SUCH AN EXPEDIENT; THE CASE IS THEREFORE THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THOSE WHO REVERENCE THIS IDEAL BELIEVE: LIFE WRESTLES IN IT AND THROUGH IT WITH DEATH AND AGAINST DEATH; THE ASCETIC IDEAL IS AN ARTIFICE FOR THE PRESERVATION OF LIFE.

THAT THIS IDEAL ACQUIRED SUCH POWER AND RULED OVER MEN AS IMPERIOUSLY AS WE FIND IT IN HISTORY, ESPECIALLY WHEREVER THE CIVILIZATION AND TAMING OF MAN HAS BEEN CARRIED THROUGH, EXPRESSES A GREAT FACT: THE SICKLINESS OF THE TYPE OF MAN WE HAVE HAD HITHERTO, OR AT LEAST OF THE TAMED MAN, AND THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STRUGGLE OF MAN AGAINST DEATH (MORE PRECISELY: AGAINST DISGUST WITH LIFE, AGAINST EXHAUSTION, AGAINST THE DESIRE FOR THE ‚ÄÚEND‚ÄÙ). THE ASCETIC PRIEST IS THE INCARNATE DESIRE TO BE DIFFERENT, TO BE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE, AND INDEED THIS DESIRE AT ITS GREATEST EXTREME, ITS DISTINCTIVE FERVOR AND PASSION; BUT PRECISELY THIS POWER OF HIS DESIRE IS THE CHAIN THAT HOLDS HIM CAPTIVE SO THAT HE BECOMES A TOOL FOR THE CREATION OF MORE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR BEING HERE AND BEING MAN‚ÄÎIT IS PRECISELY THIS POWER THAT ENABLES HIM TO PERSUADE TO EXISTENCE THE WHOLE HERD OF THE ILL-CONSTITUTED, DISGRUNTLED, UNDERPRIVILEGED, UNFORTUNATE, AND ALL WHO SUFFER OF THEMSELVES, BY INSTINCTIVELY GOING BEFORE THEM AS THEIR SHEPHERD. YOU WILL SEE MY POINT: THIS ASCETIC PRIEST, THIS APPARENT ENEMY OF LIFE, THIS DENIER‚ÄÎPRECISELY HE IS AMONG THE GREATEST CONSERVING AND YES-CREATING1 FORCES OF LIFE.

WHERE DOES IT COME FROM, THIS SICKLINESS? FOR MAN IS MORE SICK, UNCERTAIN, CHANGEABLE, INDETERMINATE THAN ANY OTHER ANIMAL, THERE IS NO DOUBT OF THAT‚ÄÎHE IS THE SICK ANIMAL: HOW HAS THAT COME ABOUT? CERTAINLY HE HAS ALSO DARED MORE, DONE MORE NEW THINGS, BRAVED MORE AND CHALLENGED FATE MORE THAN ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS PUT TOGETHER: HE, THE GREAT EXPERIMENTER WITH HIMSELF, DISCONTENTED AND INSATIABLE, WRESTLING WITH ANIMALS, NATURE, AND GODS FOR ULTIMATE DOMINION‚ÄÎHE, STILL UNVANQUISHED, ETERNALLY DIRECTED TOWARD THE FUTURE, WHOSE OWN RESTLESS ENERGIES NEVER LEAVE HIM IN PEACE, SO THAT HIS FUTURE DIGS LIKE A SPUR INTO THE FLESH OF EVERY PRESENT‚ÄÎHOW SHOULD SUCH A COURAGEOUS AND RICHLY ENDOWED ANIMAL NOT ALSO BE THE MOST IMPERILED, THE MOST CHRONICALLY AND PROFOUNDLY SICK OF ALL SICK ANIMALS?

MAN HAS OFTEN HAD ENOUGH; THERE ARE ACTUAL EPIDEMICS OF HAVING HAD ENOUGH (AS AROUND 1348, AT THE TIME OF THE DANCE OF DEATH); BUT EVEN THIS NAUSEA, THIS WEARINESS, THIS DISGUST WITH HIMSELF‚ÄÎALL THIS BURSTS FROM HIM WITH SUCH VIOLENCE THAT IT AT ONCE BECOMES A NEW FETTER. THE NO HE SAYS TO LIFE BRINGS TO LIGHT, AS IF BY MAGIC, AN ABUNDANCE OF TENDER YESES; EVEN WHEN HE WOUNDS HIMSELF, THIS MASTER OF DESTRUCTION, OF SELF-DESTRUCTION‚ÄÎTHE VERY WOUND ITSELF AFTERWARD COMPELS HIM TO LIVE.‚ÄÎ

THE MORE NORMAL SICKLINESS BECOMES AMONG MEN‚ÄÎAND WE CANNOT DENY ITS NORMALITY‚ÄÎTHE HIGHER SHOULD BE THE HONOR ACCORDED THE RARE CASES OF GREAT POWER OF SOUL AND BODY, MAN‚ÄÔS LUCKY HITS; THE MORE WE SHOULD PROTECT THE WELL-CONSTITUTED FROM THE WORST KIND OF AIR, THE AIR OF THE SICKROOM. IS THIS DONE?

THE SICK REPRESENT THE GREATEST DANGER FOR THE HEALTHY; IT IS NOT THE STRONGEST BUT THE WEAKEST WHO SPELL DISASTER FOR THE STRONG. IS THIS KNOWN?

BROADLY SPEAKING, IT IS NOT FEAR OF MAN THAT WE SHOULD DESIRE TO SEE DIMINISHED; FOR THIS FEAR COMPELS THE STRONG TO BE STRONG, AND OCCASIONALLY TERRIBLE‚ÄÎIT MAINTAINS THE WELL-CONSTITUTED TYPE OF MAN. WHAT IS TO BE FEARED, WHAT HAS A MORE CALAMITOUS EFFECT THAN ANY OTHER CALAMITY, IS THAT MAN SHOULD INSPIRE NOT PROFOUND FEAR BUT PROFOUND NAUSEA; ALSO NOT GREAT FEAR BUT GREAT PITY. SUPPOSE THESE TWO WERE ONE DAY TO UNITE, THEY WOULD INEVITABLY BEGET ONE OF THE UNCANNIEST MONSTERS: THE ‚ÄÚLAST WILL‚ÄÙ OF MAN, HIS WILL TO NOTHINGNESS, NIHILISM. AND INDEED A GREAT DEAL POINTS TO THIS UNION. WHOEVER CAN SMELL NOT ONLY WITH HIS NOSE BUT ALSO WITH HIS EYES AND EARS, SCENTS ALMOST EVERYWHERE HE GOES TODAY SOMETHING LIKE THE AIR OF MADHOUSES AND HOSPITALS‚ÄÎI AM SPEAKING, OF COURSE, OF THE CULTURAL DOMAIN, OF EVERY KIND OF ‚ÄÚEUROPE‚ÄÙ ON THIS EARTH. THE SICK ARE MAN‚ÄÔS GREATEST DANGER; NOT THE EVIL, NOT THE ‚ÄÚBEASTS OF PREY.‚ÄÙ THOSE WHO ARE FAILURES FROM THE START, DOWNTRODDEN, CRUSHED‚ÄÎIT IS THEY, THE WEAKEST, WHO MUST UNDERMINE LIFE AMONG MEN, WHO CALL INTO QUESTION AND POISON MOST DANGEROUSLY OUR TRUST IN LIFE, IN MAN, AND IN OURSELVES. WHERE DOES ONE NOT ENCOUNTER THAT VEILED GLANCE WHICH BURDENS ONE WITH A PROFOUND SADNESS, THAT INWARD-TURNED GLANCE OF THE BORN FAILURE WHICH BETRAYS HOW SUCH A MAN SPEAKS TO HIMSELF‚ÄÎTHAT GLANCE WHICH IS A SIGH! ‚ÄÚIF ONLY I WERE SOMEONE ELSE,‚ÄÙ SIGHS THIS GLANCE: ‚ÄÚBUT THERE IS NO HOPE OF THAT. I AM WHO I AM: HOW COULD I EVER GET FREE OF MYSELF? AND YET‚ÄÎI AM SICK OF MYSELF!‚ÄÙ

IT IS ON SUCH SOIL, ON SWAMPY GROUND, THAT EVERY WEED, EVERY POISONOUS PLANT GROWS, ALWAYS SO SMALL, SO HIDDEN, SO FALSE, SO SACCHARINE. HERE THE WORMS OF VENGEFULNESS AND RANCOR SWARM; HERE THE AIR STINKS OF SECRETS AND CONCEALMENT; HERE THE WEB OF THE MOST MALICIOUS OF ALL CONSPIRACIES IS BEING SPUN CONSTANTLY‚ÄÎTHE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUFFERING AGAINST THE WELL-CONSTITUTED AND VICTORIOUS, HERE THE ASPECT OF THE VICTORIOUS IS HATED. AND WHAT MENDACIOUSNESS IS EMPLOYED TO DISGUISE THAT THIS HATRED IS HATRED! WHAT A DISPLAY OF GRAND WORDS AND POSTURES, WHAT AN ART OF ‚ÄÚHONEST‚ÄÙ CALUMNY! THESE FAILURES: WHAT NOBLE ELOQUENCE FLOWS FROM THEIR LIPS! HOW MUCH SUGARY, SLIMY, HUMBLE SUBMISSIVENESS SWIMS IN THEIR EYES! WHAT DO THEY REALLY WANT? AT LEAST TO REPRESENT JUSTICE, LOVE, WISDOM, SUPERIORITY‚ÄÎTHAT IS THE AMBITION OF THE ‚ÄÚLOWEST,‚ÄÙ THE SICK. AND HOW SKILLFULL SUCH AN AMBITION MAKES THEM! ADMIRE ABOVE ALL THE FORGER‚ÄÔS SKILL WITH WHICH THE STAMP OF VIRTUE, EVEN THE RING, THE GOLDEN-SOUNDING RING OF VIRTUE, IS HERE COUNTERFEITED. THEY MONOPOLIZE VIRTUE, THESE WEAK, HOPELESSLY SICK PEOPLE, THERE IS NO DOUBT OF IT: ‚ÄÚWE ALONE ARE THE GOOD AND JUST,‚ÄÙ THEY SAY, ‚ÄÚWE ALONE ARE HOMINES BONAE VOLUNTATIS.‚ÄÙ1 THEY WALK AMONG US AS EMBODIED REPROACHES, AS WARNINGS TO US‚ÄÎAS IF HEALTH, WELL-CONSTITUTEDNESS, STRENGTH, PRIDE, AND THE SENSE OF POWER WERE IN THEMSELVES NECESSARILY VICIOUS THINGS FOR WHICH ONE MUST PAY SOME DAY, AND PAY BITTERLY: HOW READY THEY THEMSELVES ARE AT BOTTOM TO MAKE ONE PAY; HOW THEY CRAVE TO BE HANGMEN. THERE IS AMONG THEM AN ABUNDANCE OF THE VENGEFUL DISGUISED AS JUDGES, WHO CONSTANTLY BEAR THE WORD ‚ÄÚJUSTICE‚ÄÙ IN THEIR MOUTHS LIKE POISONOUS SPITTLE, ALWAYS WITH PURSED LIPS, ALWAYS READY TO SPIT UPON ALL WHO ARE NOT DISCONTENTED BUT GO THEIR WAY IN GOOD SPIRITS. NOR IS THERE LACKING AMONG THEM THAT MOST DISGUSTING SPECIES OF THE VAIN, THE MENDACIOUS FAILURES WHOSE AIM IS TO APPEAR AS ‚ÄÚBEAUTIFUL SOULS‚ÄÙ AND WHO BRING TO MARKET THEIR DEFORMED SENSUALITY, WRAPPED UP IN VERSES AND OTHER SWADDLING CLOTHES, AS ‚ÄÚPURITY OF HEART‚ÄÙ: THE SPECIES OF MORAL MASTURBATERS AND ‚ÄÚSELF-GRATIFIERS.‚ÄÙ THE WILL OF THE WEAK TO REPRESENT SOME FORM OF SUPERIORITY, THEIR INSTINCT FOR DEVIOUS PATHS TO TYRANNY OVER THE HEALTHY‚ÄÎWHERE CAN IT NOT BE DISCOVERED, THIS WILL TO POWER OF THE WEAKEST!

THE SICK WOMAN ESPECIALLY: NO ONE CAN EXCEL HER IN THE WILES TO DOMINATE, OPPRESS, AND TYRANNIZE. THE SICK WOMAN SPARES NOTHING, LIVING OR DEAD; SHE WILL DIG UP THE MOST DEEPLY BURIED THINGS (THE BOGOS SAY: ‚ÄÚWOMAN IS A HYENA‚ÄÙ).

EXAMINE THE BACKGROUND OF EVERY FAMILY, EVERY ORGANIZATION, EVERY COMMONWEALTH: EVERYWHERE THE STRUGGLE OF THE SICK AGAINST THE HEALTHY‚ÄÎA SILENT STRUGGLE AS A RULE, WITH PETTY POISONS, WITH PINPRICKS, WITH SLY LONG-SUFFERING EXPRESSIONS, BUT OCCASIONALLY ALSO WITH THAT INVALID‚ÄÔS PHARISEEISM OF LOUD GESTURES THAT LIKES BEST TO POSE AS ‚ÄÚNOBLE INDIGNATION.‚ÄÙ THIS HOARSE, INDIGNANT BARKING OF SICK DOGS, THIS RABID MENDACIOUSNESS AND RAGE OF ‚ÄÚNOBLE‚ÄÙ PHARISEES, PENETRATES EVEN THE HALLOWED HALLS OF SCIENCE (I AGAIN REMIND READERS WHO HAVE EARS FOR SUCH THINGS OF THAT BERLIN APOSTLE OF REVENGE, EUGEN D√ºHRING, WHO EMPLOYS MORAL MUMBO-JUMBO MORE INDECENTLY AND REPULSIVELY THAN ANYONE ELSE IN GERMANY TODAY: D√ºHRING, THE FOREMOST MORAL BIGMOUTH TODAY‚ÄÎUNEXCELLED EVEN AMONG HIS OWN ILK, THE ANTI-SEMITES).

THEY ARE ALL MEN OF RESSENTIMENT, PHYSIOLOGICALLY UNFORTUNATE AND WORM-EATEN, A WHOLE TREMULOUS REALM OF SUBTERRANEAN REVENGE, INEXHAUSTIBLE AND INSATIABLE IN OUTBURSTS AGAINST THE FORTUNATE AND HAPPY2 AND IN MASQUERADES OF REVENGE AND PRETEXTS FOR REVENGE: WHEN WOULD THEY ACHIEVE THE ULTIMATE, SUBTLEST, SUBLIMEST TRIUMPH OF REVENGE? UNDOUBTEDLY IF THEY SUCCEEDED IN POISONING THE CONSCIENCES OF THE FORTUNATE WITH THEIR OWN MISERY, WITH ALL MISERY, SO THAT ONE DAY THE FORTUNATE BEGAN TO BE ASHAMED OF THEIR GOOD FORTUNE AND PERHAPS SAID ONE TO ANOTHER: ‚ÄÚIT IS DISGRACEFUL TO BE FORTUNATE: THERE IS TOO MUCH MISERY!‚ÄÙ

BUT NO GREATER OR MORE CALAMITOUS MISUNDERSTANDING IS POSSIBLE THAN FOR THE HAPPY, WELL-CONSTITUTED, POWERFUL IN SOUL AND BODY, TO BEGIN TO DOUBT THEIR RIGHT TO HAPPINESS IN THIS FASHION. AWAY WITH THIS ‚ÄÚINVERTED WORLD‚ÄÙ! AWAY WITH THIS SHAMEFUL EMASCULATION OF FEELING! THAT THE SICK SHOULD NOT MAKE THE HEALTHY SICK‚ÄÎAND THIS IS WHAT SUCH AN EMASCULATION WOULD INVOLVE‚ÄÎSHOULD SURELY BE OUR SUPREME CONCERN ON EARTH; BUT THIS REQUIRES ABOVE ALL THAT THE HEALTHY SHOULD BE SEGREGATED FROM THE SICK, GUARDED EVEN FROM THE SIGHT OF THE SICK, THAT THEY MAY NOT CONFOUND THEMSELVES WITH THE SICK. OR IS IT THEIR TASK, PERHAPS, TO BE NURSES OR PHYSICIANS?3

BUT NO WORSE MISUNDERSTANDING AND DENIAL OF THEIR TASK CAN BE IMAGINED: THE HIGHER OUGHT NOT TO DEGRADE ITSELF TO THE STATUS OF AN INSTRUMENT OF THE LOWER, THE PATHOS OF DISTANCE OUGHT TO KEEP THEIR TASKS ETERNALLY SEPARATE! THEIR RIGHT TO EXIST, THE PRIVILEGE OF THE FULL-TONED BELL OVER THE FALSE AND CRACKED, IS A THOUSAND TIMES GREATER: THEY ALONE ARE OUR WARRANTY FOR THE FUTURE, THEY ALONE ARE LIABLE FOR THE FUTURE OF MAN. THE SICK CAN NEVER HAVE THE ABILITY OR OBLIGATION TO DO WHAT THEY CAN DO, WHAT THEY OUGHT TO DO: BUT IF THEY ARE TO BE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY ALONE OUGHT TO DO, HOW CAN THEY AT THE SAME TIME BE PHYSICIANS, CONSOLERS, AND ‚ÄÚSAVIORS‚ÄÙ OF THE SICK?

AND THEREFORE LET US HAVE FRESH AIR! FRESH AIR! AND KEEP CLEAR OF THE MADHOUSES AND HOSPITALS OF CULTURE! AND THEREFORE LET US HAVE GOOD COMPANY, OUR COMPANY! OR SOLITUDE, IF IT MUST BE! BUT AWAY FROM THE SICKENING FUMES OF INNER CORRUPTION AND THE HIDDEN ROT OF DISEASE!‚Ä¶SO THAT WE MAY, AT LEAST FOR A WHILE YET, GUARD OURSELVES, MY FRIENDS, AGAINST THE TWO WORST CONTAGIONS THAT MAY BE RESERVED JUST FOR US‚ÄÎAGAINST THE GREAT NAUSEA AT MAN! AGAINST GREAT PITY FOR MAN!4

IF ONE HAS GRASPED IN ALL ITS PROFUNDITY‚ÄÎAND I INSIST THAT PRECISELY THIS MATTER REQUIRES PROFOUND APPREHENSION AND COMPREHENSION‚ÄÎHOW IT CANNOT BE THE TASK OF THE HEALTHY TO NURSE THE SICK AND TO MAKE THEM WELL, THEN ONE HAS ALSO GRASPED ONE FURTHER NECESSITY‚ÄÎTHE NECESSITY OF DOCTORS AND NURSES WHO ARE THEMSELVES SICK; AND NOW WE UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE ASCETIC PRIEST AND GRASP IT WITH BOTH HANDS.

WE MUST COUNT THE ASCETIC PRIEST AS THE PREDESTINED SAVIOR, SHEPHERD, AND ADVOCATE OF THE SICK HERD: ONLY THUS CAN WE UNDERSTAND HIS TREMENDOUS HISTORICAL MISSION. DOMINION OVER THE SUFFERING IS HIS KINGDOM, THAT IS WHERE HIS INSTINCT DIRECTS HIM, HERE HE POSSESSES HIS DISTINCTIVE ART, HIS MASTERY, HIS KIND OF HAPPINESS. HE MUST BE SICK HIMSELF, HE MUST BE PROFOUNDLY RELATED TO THE SICK‚ÄÎHOW ELSE WOULD THEY UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER?‚ÄÎBUT HE MUST ALSO BE STRONG, MASTER OF HIMSELF EVEN MORE THAN OF OTHERS, WITH HIS WILL TO POWER INTACT, SO AS TO BE BOTH TRUSTED AND FEARED BY THE SICK, SO AS TO BE THEIR SUPPORT, RESISTANCE, PROP, COMPULSION, TASKMASTER, TYRANT, AND GOD. HE HAS TO DEFEND HIS HERD‚ÄÎAGAINST WHOM? AGAINST THE HEALTHY, OF COURSE, AND ALSO AGAINST ENVY OF THE HEALTHY; HE MUST BE THE NATURAL OPPONENT AND DESPISER OF ALL RUDE, STORMY, UNBRIDLED, HARD, VIOLENT BEAST-OF-PREY HEALTH AND MIGHT. THE PRIEST IS THE FIRST FORM OF THE MORE DELICATE ANIMAL THAT DESPISES MORE READILY THAN IT HATES. HE WILL NOT BE SPARED WAR WITH THE BEASTS OF PREY, A WAR OF CUNNING (OF THE ‚ÄÚSPIRIT‚ÄÙ) RATHER THAN ONE OF FORCE, AS GOES WITHOUT SAYING; TO FIGHT IT HE WILL UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES NEED TO EVOLVE A VIRTUALLY NEW TYPE OF PREYING ANIMAL OUT OF HIMSELF, OR AT LEAST HE WILL NEED TO REPRESENT IT‚ÄÎA NEW KIND OF ANIMAL FEROCITY IN WHICH THE POLAR BEAR, THE SUPPLE, COLD, AND PATIENT TIGER, AND NOT LEAST THE FOX SEEM TO BE JOINED IN A UNITY AT ONCE ENTICING AND TERRIFYING. IF NEED COMPELS HIM, HE WILL WALK AMONG THE OTHER BEASTS OF PREY WITH BEARLIKE SERIOUSNESS AND FEIGNED SUPERIORITY, VENERABLE, PRUDENT, AND COLD, AS THE HERALD AND MOUTHPIECE OF MORE MYSTERIOUS POWERS, DETERMINED TO SOW THIS SOIL WITH MISERY, DISCORD, AND SELF-CONTRADICTION WHEREVER HE CAN AND, ONLY TOO CERTAIN OF HIS ART, TO DOMINATE THE SUFFERING AT ALL TIMES. HE BRINGS SALVES AND BALM WITH HIM, NO DOUBT; BUT BEFORE HE CAN ACT AS A PHYSICIAN HE FIRST HAS TO WOUND; WHEN HE THEN STILLS THE PAIN OF THE WOUND HE AT THE SAME TIME INFECTS THE WOUND‚ÄÎFOR THAT IS WHAT HE KNOWS TO DO BEST OF ALL, THIS SORCERER AND ANIMAL-TAMER, IN WHOSE PRESENCE EVERYTHING HEALTHY NECESSARILY GROWS SICK, AND EVERYTHING SICK TAME.

INDEED, HE DEFENDS HIS SICK HERD WELL ENOUGH, THIS STRANGE SHEPHERD‚ÄÎHE ALSO DEFENDS IT AGAINST ITSELF, AGAINST THE BASENESS, SPITE, MALICE, AND WHATEVER ELSE IS NATURAL TO THE AILING AND SICK AND SMOLDERS WITHIN THE HERD ITSELF; HE FIGHTS WITH CUNNING AND SEVERITY AND IN SECRET AGAINST ANARCHY AND EVER-THREATENING DISINTEGRATION WITHIN THE HERD, IN WHICH THE MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL EXPLOSIVES, RESSENTIMENT, IS CONSTANTLY ACCUMULATING. SO TO DETONATE THIS EXPLOSIVE THAT IT DOES NOT BLOW UP HERD AND HERDSMAN IS HIS ESSENTIAL ART, AS IT IS HIS SUPREME UTILITY; IF ONE WANTED TO EXPRESS THE VALUE OF THE PRIESTLY EXISTENCE IN THE BRIEFEST FORMULA IT WOULD BE: THE PRIEST ALTERS THE DIRECTION OF RESSENTIMENT.

FOR EVERY SUFFERER INSTINCTIVELY SEEKS A CAUSE FOR HIS SUFFERING; MORE EXACTLY, AN AGENT; STILL MORE SPECIFICALLY, A GUILTY AGENT WHO IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO SUFFERING‚ÄÎIN SHORT, SOME LIVING THING UPON WHICH HE CAN, ON SOME PRETEXT OR OTHER, VENT HIS AFFECTS, ACTUALLY OR IN EFFIGY: FOR THE VENTING OF HIS AFFECTS REPRESENTS THE GREATEST ATTEMPT ON THE PART OF THE SUFFERING TO WIN RELIEF, ANAESTHESIA‚ÄÎTHE NARCOTIC HE CANNOT HELP DESIRING TO DEADEN PAIN OF ANY KIND. THIS ALONE, I SURMISE, CONSTITUTES THE ACTUAL PHYSIOLOGICAL CAUSE OF RESSENTIMENT, VENGEFULNESS, AND THE LIKE: A DESIRE TO DEADEN PAIN BY MEANS OF AFFECTS. THIS CAUSE IS USUALLY SOUGHT, QUITE WRONGLY IN MY VIEW, IN DEFENSIVE RETALIATION, A MERE REACTIVE PROTECTIVE MEASURE, A ‚ÄÚREFLEX MOVEMENT‚ÄÙ SET OFF BY SUDDEN INJURY OR PERIL, SUCH AS EVEN A BEHEADED FROG STILL MAKES TO SHAKE OFF A CORROSIVE ACID. BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS FUNDAMENTAL: IN THE ONE CASE, THE DESIRE IS TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER INJURY, IN THE OTHER IT IS TO DEADEN, BY MEANS OF A MORE VIOLENT EMOTION OF ANY KIND, A TORMENTING, SECRET PAIN THAT IS BECOMING UNENDURABLE, AND TO DRIVE IT OUT OF CONSCIOUSNESS AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT: FOR THAT ONE REQUIRES AN AFFECT, AS SAVAGE AN AFFECT AS POSSIBLE, AND, IN ORDER TO EXCITE THAT, ANY PRETEXT AT ALL. ‚ÄÚSOMEONE OR OTHER MUST BE TO BLAME FOR MY FEELING ILL‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHIS KIND OF REASONING IS COMMON TO ALL THE SICK, AND IS INDEED HELD THE MORE FIRMLY THE MORE THE REAL CAUSE OF THEIR FEELING ILL, THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CAUSE, REMAINS HIDDEN. (IT MAY PERHAPS LIE IN SOME DISEASE OF THE NERVUS SYMPATHICUS, OR IN AN EXCESSIVE SECRETION OF BILE, OR IN A DEFICIENCY OF POTASSIUM SULPHATE AND PHOSPHATE IN THE BLOOD, OR IN AN OBSTRUCTION IN THE ABDOMEN WHICH IMPEDES THE BLOOD CIRCULATION, OR IN DEGENERATION OF THE OVARIES, AND THE LIKE).

THE SUFFERING ARE ONE AND ALL DREADFULLY EAGER AND INVENTIVE IN DISCOVERING OCCASIONS FOR PAINFUL AFFECTS; THEY ENJOY BEING MISTRUSTFUL AND DWELLING ON NASTY DEEDS AND IMAGINARY SLIGHTS; THEY SCOUR THE ENTRAILS OF THEIR PAST AND PRESENT FOR OBSCURE AND QUESTIONABLE OCCURRENCES THAT OFFER THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVEL IN TORMENTING SUSPICIONS AND TO INTOXICATE THEMSELVES WITH THE POISON OF THEIR OWN MALICE: THEY TEAR OPEN THEIR OLDEST WOUNDS, THEY BLEED FROM LONG-HEALED SCARS, THEY MAKE EVILDOERS OUT OF THEIR FRIENDS, WIVES, CHILDREN, AND WHOEVER ELSE STANDS CLOSEST TO THEM.1 ‚ÄÚI SUFFER: SOMEONE MUST BE TO BLAME FOR IT‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHUS THINKS EVERY SICKLY SHEEP. BUT HIS SHEPHERD, THE ASCETIC PRIEST, TELLS HIM: ‚ÄÚQUITE SO, MY SHEEP! SOMEONE MUST BE TO BLAME FOR IT: BUT YOU YOURSELF ARE THIS SOMEONE, YOU ALONE ARE TO BLAME FOR IT‚ÄÎYOU ALONE ARE TO BLAME FOR YOURSELF!‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHIS IS BRAZEN AND FALSE ENOUGH: BUT ONE THING AT LEAST IS ACHIEVED BY IT, THE DIRECTION OF RESSENTIMENT IS ALTERED.





16


YOU WILL GUESS WHAT, ACCORDING TO MY IDEA, THE CURATIVE INSTINCT OF LIFE HAS AT LEAST ATTEMPTED THROUGH THE ASCETIC PRIEST, AND WHY IT REQUIRED FOR A TIME THE TYRANNY OF SUCH PARADOXICAL AND PARALOGICAL CONCEPTS AS ‚ÄÚGUILT,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚSIN,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚSINFULNESS,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚDEPRAVITY,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚDAMNATION‚ÄÙ: TO RENDER THE SICK TO A CERTAIN DEGREE HARMLESS, TO WORK THE SELF-DESTRUCTION OF THE INCURABLE, TO DIRECT THE RESSENTIMENT OF THE LESS SEVERELY AFFLICTED STERNLY BACK UPON THEMSELVES (‚ÄÚONE THING IS NEEDFUL‚ÄÙ)‚ÄÎAND IN THIS WAY TO EXPLOIT THE BAD INSTINCTS OF ALL SUFFERERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF SELF-DISCIPLINE, SELF-SURVEILLANCE, AND SELF-OVERCOMING.

IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT A ‚ÄÚMEDICATION‚ÄÙ OF THIS KIND, A MERE AFFECT MEDICATION, CANNOT POSSIBLY BRING ABOUT A REAL CURE OF SICKNESS IN A PHYSIOLOGICAL SENSE; WE MAY NOT EVEN SUPPOSE THAT THE INSTINCT OF LIFE CONTEMPLATES OR INTENDS ANY SORT OF CURE. A KIND OF CONCENTRATION AND ORGANIZATION OF THE SICK ON ONE SIDE (THE WORD ‚ÄÚCHURCH‚ÄÙ IS THE MOST POPULAR NAME FOR IT), A KIND OF PROVISIONAL SAFEGUARDING OF THE MORE HEALTHILY CONSTITUTED, THE MORE FULLY ACHIEVED, ON THE OTHER, AND THE CREATION OF A CHASM BETWEEN HEALTHY AND SICK‚ÄÎFOR A LONG TIME THAT WAS ALL! AND IT WAS MUCH! VERY MUCH!

(IT IS PLAIN THAT IN THIS ESSAY I PROCEED ON A PRESUPPOSITION THAT I DO NOT FIRST HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE TO READERS OF THE KIND I NEED: THAT MAN‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚSINFULNESS‚ÄÙ IS NOT A FACT, BUT MERELY THE INTERPRETATION OF A FACT, NAMELY OF PHYSIOLOGICAL DEPRESSION‚ÄÎTHE LATTER VIEWED IN A RELIGIO-MORAL PERSPECTIVE THAT IS NO LONGER BINDING ON US.‚ÄÎTHAT SOMEONE FEELS ‚ÄÚGUILTY‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚSINFUL‚ÄÙ IS NO PROOF THAT HE IS RIGHT, ANY MORE THAN A MAN IS HEALTHY MERELY BECAUSE HE FEELS HEALTHY. RECALL THE FAMOUS WITCH TRIALS: THE MOST ACUTE AND HUMANE JUDGES WERE IN NO DOUBT AS TO THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED; THE ‚ÄÚWITCHES‚ÄÙ THEMSELVES DID NOT DOUBT IT‚ÄÎAND YET THERE WAS NO GUILT.‚ÄÎTO EXPRESS THIS PRESUPPOSITION IN A MORE GENERAL FORM: I CONSIDER EVEN ‚ÄÚPSYCHOLOGICAL PAIN‚ÄÙ TO BE NOT A FACT BUT ONLY AN INTERPRETATION‚ÄÎA CAUSAL INTERPRETATION‚ÄÎOF FACTS THAT HAVE HITHERTO DEFIED EXACT FORMULATION‚ÄÎTOO VAGUE TO BE SCIENTIFICALLY SERIOUS‚ÄÎA FAT WORD REPLACING A VERY THIN QUESTION MARK. WHEN SOMEONE CANNOT GET OVER A ‚ÄÚPSYCHOLOGICAL PAIN,‚ÄÙ THAT IS NOT THE FAULT OF HIS ‚ÄÚPSYCHE‚ÄÙ BUT, TO SPEAK CRUDELY, MORE PROBABLY EVEN THAT OF HIS BELLY (SPEAKING CRUDELY, TO REPEAT, WHICH DOES NOT MEAN THAT I WANT TO BE HEARD CRUDELY OR UNDERSTOOD CRUDELY‚ÄÎ). A STRONG AND WELL-CONSTITUTED MAN DIGESTS HIS EXPERIENCES (HIS DEEDS AND MISDEEDS INCLUDED) AS HE DIGESTS HIS MEALS, EVEN WHEN HE HAS TO SWALLOW SOME TOUGH MORSELS. IF HE CANNOT GET OVER AN EXPERIENCE AND HAVE DONE WITH IT, THIS KIND OF INDIGESTION IS AS MUCH PHYSIOLOGICAL AS IS THE OTHER‚ÄÎAND OFTEN IN FACT MERELY A CONSEQUENCE OF THE OTHER.‚ÄÎWITH SUCH A CONCEPTION ONE CAN, BETWEEN OURSELVES, STILL BE THE STERNEST OPPONENT OF ALL MATERIALISM.‚ÄÎ)





17


BUT IS HE REALLY A PHYSICIAN, THIS ASCETIC PRIEST?‚ÄÎWE HAVE SEEN WHY IT IS HARDLY PERMISSIBLE TO CALL HIM A PHYSICIAN, HOWEVER MUCH HE ENJOYS FEELING LIKE A ‚ÄÚSAVIOR‚ÄÙ AND LETTING HIMSELF BE REVERENCED AS A ‚ÄÚSAVIOR.‚ÄÙ HE COMBATS ONLY THE SUFFERING ITSELF, THE DISCOMFITURE OF THE SUFFERER, NOT ITS CAUSE, NOT THE REAL SICKNESS: THIS MUST BE OUR MOST FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTION TO PRIESTLY MEDICATION.

BUT IF ONE ADOPTS THE ONLY PERSPECTIVE KNOWN TO THE PRIEST, IT IS NOT EASY TO SET BOUNDS TO ONE‚ÄÔS ADMIRATION OF HOW MUCH HE HAS SEEN, SOUGHT, AND FOUND UNDER THIS PERSPECTIVE. THE ALLEVIATION OF SUFFERING, ‚ÄÚCONSOLATION‚ÄÙ OF EVERY KIND‚ÄÎHERE LIES HIS GENIUS; HOW INVENTIVELY HE HAS GONE ABOUT HIS TASK OF CONSOLATION, HOW BOLDLY AND UNSCRUPULOUSLY HE HAS SELECTED THE MEANS FOR IT! CHRISTIANITY IN PARTICULAR MAY BE CALLED A GREAT TREASURE HOUSE OF INGENIOUS MEANS OF CONSOLATION: IT OFFERS SUCH A COLLECTION OF REFRESHMENTS, PALLIATIVES, AND NARCOTICS; IT RISKS SO MUCH THAT IS MOST DANGEROUS AND AUDACIOUS; IT HAS DISPLAYED SUCH REFINEMENT AND SUBTLETY, SUCH SOUTHERN SUBTLETY, IN GUESSING WHAT STIMULANT AFFECTS WILL OVERCOME, AT LEAST FOR A TIME, THE DEEP DEPRESSION, THE LEADEN EXHAUSTION, THE BLACK MELANCHOLY OF THE PHYSIOLOGICALLY INHIBITED. FOR WE MAY GENERALIZE: THE MAIN CONCERN OF ALL GREAT RELIGIONS HAS BEEN TO FIGHT A CERTAIN WEARINESS AND HEAVINESS GROWN TO EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS.

ONE MAY ASSUME IN ADVANCE THE PROBABILITY THAT FROM TIME TO TIME AND IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE EARTH A FEELING OF PHYSIOLOGICAL INHIBITION IS ALMOST BOUND TO SEIZE ON LARGE MASSES OF PEOPLE, THOUGH, OWING TO THEIR LACK OF PHYSIOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE, THEY DO NOT DIAGNOSE IT AS SUCH: ITS ‚ÄÚCAUSE‚ÄÙ AND REMEDY ARE SOUGHT AND TESTED ONLY IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL-MORAL DOMAIN (THIS IS MY MOST GENERAL FORMULA FOR WHAT IS USUALLY CALLED A ‚ÄÚRELIGION‚ÄÙ). SUCH A FEELING OF INHIBITION CAN HAVE THE MOST VARIOUS ORIGINS: PERHAPS IT MAY ARISE FROM THE CROSSING OF RACES TOO DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER (OR OF CLASSES‚ÄÎCLASSES ALWAYS ALSO EXPRESS DIFFERENCES OF ORIGIN AND RACE: EUROPEAN ‚ÄÚWELTSCHMERZ,‚ÄÙ1 THE ‚ÄÚPESSIMISM‚ÄÙ OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, IS ESSENTIALLY THE RESULT OF AN ABSURDLY PRECIPITATE MIXING OF CLASSES); OR FROM AN INJUDICIOUS EMIGRATION‚ÄÎA RACE INTRODUCED INTO A CLIMATE FOR WHICH ITS POWERS OF ADAPTATION ARE INADEQUATE (THE CASE OF THE INDIANS IN INDIA); OR FROM THE AFTEREFFECTS OF AGE AND EXHAUSTION IN THE RACE (PARISIAN PESSIMISM FROM 1850 ONWARD); OR FROM AN INCORRECT DIET (THE ALCOHOLISM OF THE MIDDLE AGES; THE ABSURDITY OF THE VEGETARIANS WHO, TO BE SURE, CAN INVOKE THE AUTHORITY OF SQUIRE CHRISTOPHER IN SHAKESPEARE);2 OR FROM DEGENERATION OF THE BLOOD, MALARIA, SYPHILIS, AND THE LIKE (GERMAN DEPRESSION AFTER THE THIRTY YEARS‚ÄÔ WAR, WHICH INFECTED HALF OF GERMANY WITH VILE DISEASES AND THUS PREPARED THE GROUND FOR GERMAN SERVILITY, GERMAN PUSILLANIMITY). IN EVERY SUCH CASE A GRAND STRUGGLE AGAINST THE FEELING OF DISPLEASURE IS ATTEMPTED; LET US BRIEFLY EXAMINE ITS PRINCIPAL FORMS AND METHODS. (I HERE IGNORE ALTOGETHER, AS SEEMS REASONABLE, THE PHILOSOPHERS‚ÄÔ STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS FEELING, WHICH IS USUALLY WAGED AT THE SAME TIME: IT IS INTERESTING ENOUGH BUT TOO ABSURD, TOO PRACTICALLY INEFFECTIVE, TOO MUCH THE WORK OF WEB-SPINNERS AND IDLERS‚ÄÎAS WHEN PAIN IS PROVED TO BE AN ERROR, IN THE NA√ØVE SUPPOSITION THAT PAIN IS BOUND TO VANISH AS SOON AS THE ERROR IN IT IS RECOGNIZED; BUT BEHOLD! IT REFUSES TO VANISH‚Ä¶)

THIS DOMINATING SENSE OF DISPLEASURE IS COMBATTED, FIRST,3 BY MEANS THAT REDUCE THE FEELING OF LIFE IN GENERAL TO ITS LOWEST POINT. IF POSSIBLE, WILL AND DESIRE ARE ABOLISHED ALTOGETHER; ALL THAT PRODUCES AFFECTS AND ‚ÄÚBLOOD‚ÄÙ IS AVOIDED (ABSTINENCE FROM SALT: THE HYGIENIC REGIMEN OF THE FAKIRS); NO LOVE; NO HATE; INDIFFERENCE; NO REVENGE; NO WEALTH; NO WORK; ONE BEGS; IF POSSIBLE, NO WOMEN, OR AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE; IN SPIRITUAL MATTERS, PASCAL‚ÄÔS PRINCIPLE IL FAUT S‚ÄÔAB√™TIR‚ÄÙ4 IS APPLIED. THE RESULT, EXPRESSED IN MORAL-PSYCHOLOGICAL TERMS, IS ‚ÄÚSELFLESSNESS,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚSANCTIFICATION;‚ÄÙ IN PHYSIOLOGICAL TERMS: HYPNOTIZATION‚ÄÎTHE ATTEMPT TO WIN FOR MAN AN APPROXIMATION TO WHAT IN CERTAIN ANIMALS IS HIBERNATION, IN MANY TROPICAL PLANTS ESTIVATION, THE MINIMUM METABOLISM AT WHICH LIFE WILL STILL SUBSIST WITHOUT REALLY ENTERING CONSCIOUSNESS. AN ASTONISHING AMOUNT OF HUMAN ENERGY HAS BEEN EXPENDED TO THIS END‚ÄÎHAS IT BEEN IN VAIN?

THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THESE SPORTSMEN5 OF ‚ÄÚSANCTITY‚ÄÙ WHO PROLIFERATE IN ALMOST ALL AGES AND ALL PEOPLES HAVE IN FACT DISCOVERED A REAL RELEASE FROM THAT WHICH THEY COMBATED WITH SUCH RIGOROUS TRAINING: IN COUNTLESS CASES THEY HAVE REALLY FREED THEMSELVES FROM THAT PROFOUND PHYSIOLOGICAL DEPRESSION BY MEANS OF THEIR SYSTEM OF HYPNOTICS, WHICH THUS COUNTS AMONG THE MOST UNIVERSAL FACTS OF ETHNOLOGY. NOR IS THERE ANY GROUND FOR CONSIDERING THIS PROGRAM OF STARVING THE BODY AND THE DESIRES AS NECESSARILY A SYMPTOM OF LUNACY (AS A CERTAIN CLUMSY KIND OF BEEF-EATING ‚ÄÚFREE SPIRITS‚ÄÙ AND SQUIRE CHRISTOPHER ARE WONT TO DO). BUT IT IS CERTAINLY CAPABLE OF OPENING THE WAY TO ALL KINDS OF SPIRITUAL DISTURBANCES, TO ‚ÄÚAN INNER LIGHT‚ÄÙ FOR INSTANCE, AS WITH THE HESYCHASTS OF MOUNT ATHOS,6 TO AUDITORY AND VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS, TO VOLUPTUOUS INUNDATIONS AND ECSTASIES OF SENSUALITY (THE CASE OF ST. THERESA). IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THE INTERPRETATION WHICH THOSE SUBJECT TO THESE STATES HAVE PLACED UPON THEM HAS ALWAYS BEEN AS ENTHUSIASTIC AND FALSE AS POSSIBLE; BUT WE SHOULD NOT OVERLOOK THE NOTE OF UTTERLY CONVINCED GRATITUDE THAT FINDS EXPRESSION IN THE VERY WILL TO OFFER THAT KIND OF INTERPRETATION. THE SUPREME STATE, REDEMPTION ITSELF, TOTAL HYPNOTIZATION AND REPOSE AT LAST ACHIEVED, IS ALWAYS ACCOUNTED THE MYSTERY AS SUCH FOR WHOSE EXPRESSION EVEN THE SUPREME SYMBOLS ARE INADEQUATE, AS ENTRY AND RETURN INTO THE GROUND OF THINGS, AS LIBERATION FROM ALL ILLUSION, AS ‚ÄÚKNOWLEDGE,‚ÄÙ AS ‚ÄÚTRUTH,‚ÄÙ AS ‚ÄÚBEING,‚ÄÙ AS RELEASE FROM ALL PURPOSE, ALL DESIRE, ALL ACTION, AS A STATE BEYOND EVEN GOOD AND EVIL. ‚ÄÚGOOD AND EVIL,‚ÄÙ SAYS THE BUDDHIST‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚBOTH ARE FETTERS: THE PERFECT ONE BECAME MASTER OVER BOTH;‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚWHAT IS DONE AND WHAT IS NOT DONE,‚ÄÙ SAYS THE BELIEVER OF THE VEDANTA, ‚ÄÚGIVE HIM NO PAIN; AS A SAGE, HE SHAKES GOOD AND EVIL FROM HIMSELF; NO DEED CAN HARM HIS KINGDOM; HE HAS GONE BEYOND BOTH GOOD AND EVIL‚ÄÙ: THIS IDEA IS COMMON TO ALL OF INDIA, HINDU AND BUDDHIST. (NEITHER IN THE INDIAN NOR IN THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION IS THIS ‚ÄÚREDEMPTION‚ÄÙ ATTAINABLE THROUGH VIRTUE, THROUGH MORAL IMPROVEMENT, HOWEVER HIGHLY THEY MAY ESTEEM THE VALUE OF VIRTUE AS A MEANS OF HYPNOTIZATION: ONE SHOULD REMEMBER THIS‚ÄÎHERE THEY ARE TRUE TO THE FACTS. TO HAVE REMAINED TRUE IN THIS MAY PERHAPS BE REGARDED AS THE FINEST PIECE OF REALISM IN THE THREE GREAT RELIGIONS, WHICH ARE IN OTHER RESPECTS SO STEEPED IN MORALIZATION. ‚ÄÚFOR THE MAN OF KNOWLEDGE THERE ARE NO DUTIES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚREDEMPTION CANNOT BE ATTAINED THROUGH AN INCREASE IN VIRTUE; FOR REDEMPTION CONSISTS IN BEING ONE WITH BRAHMA, IN WHOM NO INCREASE IN PERFECTION IS POSSIBLE; NOR THROUGH A DECREASE IN FAULTS: FOR BRAHMA, WITH WHOM TO BE ONE CONSTITUTES REDEMPTION, IS ETERNALLY PURE.‚ÄÙ THESE ARE PASSAGES FROM THE COMMENTARY OF SHANKARA, QUOTED BY THE FIRST EUROPEAN EXPERT IN INDIAN PHILOSOPHY, MY FRIEND PAUL DEUSSEN.7) LET US THEREFORE HONOR ‚ÄÚREDEMPTION‚ÄÙ AS IT APPEARS IN THE GREAT RELIGIONS. BUT IT IS NOT EASY FOR US TO TAKE SERIOUSLY THE HIGH VALUATION PLACED ON DEEP SLEEP BY THESE PEOPLE, SO WEARY OF LIFE THAT THEY ARE TOO WEARY EVEN TO DREAM‚ÄÎDEEP SLEEP, THAT IS, AS AN ENTRY INTO BRAHMA, AS AN ACHIEVED UNIO MYSTICA WITH GOD.

‚ÄÚWHEN HE IS COMPLETELY ASLEEP‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎIT SAYS IN THE OLDEST AND MOST VENERABLE ‚ÄÚSCRIPTURE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚAND PERFECTLY AT REST, SO THAT HE NO LONGER DREAMS, THEN, DEARLY BELOVED, HE IS UNITED WITH WHAT IS, HE HAS ENTERED INTO HIMSELF‚ÄÎEMBRACED BY THE COGNITIVE SELF, HE IS NO LONGER CONSCIOUS OF WHAT IS WITHOUT OR WITHIN. OVER THIS BRIDGE COME NEITHER DAY NOR NIGHT, NOR DEATH, NOR SUFFERING, NOR GOOD WORKS, NOR EVIL WORKS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIN DEEP SLEEP,‚ÄÙ SAY THE FAITHFUL OF THIS DEEPEST OF THE THREE GREAT RELIGIONS, ‚ÄÚTHE SOUL RISES OUT OF THE BODY, ENTERS INTO THE SUPREME LIGHT AND THUS STEPS FORTH IN ITS REAL FORM: THERE IT IS THE SUPREME SPIRIT ITSELF THAT WALKS ABOUT, JOKING AND PLAYING AND AMUSING ITSELF, WHETHER WITH WOMEN OR WITH CARRIAGES OR WITH FRIENDS; THERE IT THINKS NO MORE OF THIS APPENDAGE OF A BODY TO WHICH THE PRANA (THE BREATH OF LIFE) IS HARNESSED LIKE A BEAST TO A CART.‚ÄÙ

NONETHELESS, WE MUST BEAR IN MIND HERE, AS IN THE CASE OF ‚ÄÚREDEMPTION,‚ÄÙ THAT, ALTHOUGH IT IS ARRAYED IN ORIENTAL EXAGGERATION, WHAT IS EXPRESSED IS MERELY THE SAME APPRAISAL AS THAT OF THE CLEAR, COOL, HELLENICALLY COOL, BUT SUFFERING EPICURUS: THE HYPNOTIC SENSE OF NOTHINGNESS, THE REPOSE OF DEEPEST SLEEP, IN SHORT ABSENCE OF SUFFERING‚ÄÎSUFFERERS AND THOSE PROFOUNDLY DEPRESSED WILL COUNT THIS AS THE SUPREME GOOD, AS THE VALUE OF VALUES; THEY ARE BOUND TO ACCORD IT A POSITIVE VALUE, TO EXPERIENCE IT AS THE POSITIVE AS SUCH. (ACCORDING TO THE SAME LOGIC OF FEELING, ALL PESSIMISTIC RELIGIONS CALL NOTHINGNESS GOD.)

MUCH MORE COMMON THAN THIS HYPNOTIC MUTING OF ALL SENSITIVITY, OF THE CAPACITY TO FEEL PAIN‚ÄÎWHICH PRESUPPOSES RARE ENERGY AND ABOVE ALL COURAGE, CONTEMPT FOR OPINION, ‚ÄÚINTELLECTUAL STOICISM‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎIS A DIFFERENT TRAINING AGAINST STATES OF DEPRESSION WHICH IS AT ANY RATE EASIER: MECHANICAL ACTIVITY. IT IS BEYOND DOUBT THAT THIS REGIMEN ALLEVIATES AN EXISTENCE OF SUFFERING TO A NOT INCONSIDERABLE DEGREE: THIS FACT IS TODAY CALLED, SOMEWHAT DISHONESTLY, ‚ÄÚTHE BLESSINGS OF WORK.‚ÄÙ THE ALLEVIATION CONSISTS IN THIS, THAT THE INTEREST OF THE SUFFERER IS DIRECTED ENTIRELY AWAY FROM HIS SUFFERING‚ÄÎTHAT ACTIVITY, AND NOTHING BUT ACTIVITY, ENTERS CONSCIOUSNESS, AND THERE IS CONSEQUENTLY LITTLE ROOM LEFT IN IT FOR SUFFERING: FOR THE CHAMBER OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS IS SMALL!

MECHANICAL ACTIVITY AND WHAT GOES WITH IT‚ÄÎSUCH AS ABSOLUTE REGULARITY, PUNCTILIOUS AND UNTHINKING OBEDIENCE, A MODE OF LIFE FIXED ONCE AND FOR ALL, FULLY OCCUPIED TIME, A CERTAIN PERMISSION, INDEED TRAINING FOR ‚ÄÚIMPERSONALITY,‚ÄÙ FOR SELF-FORGETFULNESS, FOR ‚ÄÚINCURIA SUI‚ÄÙ1‚ÄÎ: HOW THOROUGHLY, HOW SUBTLY THE ASCETIC PRIEST HAS KNOWN HOW TO EMPLOY THEM IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST PAIN! WHEN HE WAS DEALING WITH SUFFERERS OF THE LOWER CLASSES, WITH WORK-SLAVES OR PRISONERS (OR WITH WOMEN‚ÄÎWHO ARE MOSTLY BOTH AT ONCE, WORK-SLAVES AND PRISONERS), HE REQUIRED HARDLY MORE THAN A LITTLE INGENUITY IN NAME-CHANGING AND REBAPTIZING TO MAKE THEM SEE BENEFITS AND A RELATIVE HAPPINESS IN THINGS THEY FORMERLY HATED: THE SLAVE‚ÄÔS DISCONTENT WITH HIS LOT WAS AT ANY RATE NOT INVENTED BY THE PRIEST.

AN EVEN MORE HIGHLY VALUED MEANS OF COMBATING DEPRESSION IS THE PRESCRIBING OF A PETTY PLEASURE THAT IS EASILY ATTAINABLE AND CAN BE MADE INTO A REGULAR EVENT; THIS MEDICATION IS OFTEN EMPLOYED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE PREVIOUS ONE. THE MOST COMMON FORM IN WHICH PLEASURE IS THUS PRESCRIBED AS A CURATIVE IS THAT OF THE PLEASURE OF GIVING PLEASURE (DOING GOOD, GIVING, RELIEVING, HELPING, ENCOURAGING, CONSOLING, PRAISING, REWARDING); BY PRESCRIBING ‚ÄÚLOVE OF THE NEIGHBOR,‚ÄÙ THE ASCETIC PRIEST PRESCRIBES FUNDAMENTALLY AN EXCITEMENT OF THE STRONGEST, MOST LIFE-AFFIRMING DRIVE, EVEN IF IN THE MOST CAUTIOUS DOSES‚ÄÎNAMELY, OF THE WILL TO POWER. THE HAPPINESS OF ‚ÄÚSLIGHT SUPERIORITY,‚ÄÙ INVOLVED IN ALL DOING GOOD, BEING USEFUL, HELPING, AND REWARDING, IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF CONSOLATION FOR THE PHYSIOLOGICALLY INHIBITED, AND WIDELY EMPLOYED BY THEM WHEN THEY ARE WELL ADVISED: OTHERWISE THEY HURT ONE ANOTHER, OBEDIENT, OF COURSE, TO THE SAME BASIC INSTINCT.

WHEN ONE LOOKS FOR THE BEGINNINGS OF CHRISTIANITY IN THE ROMAN WORLD, ONE FINDS ASSOCIATIONS FOR MUTUAL AID, ASSOCIATIONS FOR THE POOR, FOR THE SICK, FOR BURIAL, EVOLVED AMONG THE LOWEST STRATA OF SOCIETY, IN WHICH THIS MAJOR REMEDY FOR DEPRESSION, PETTY PLEASURE PRODUCED BY MUTUAL HELPFULNESS, WAS CONSCIOUSLY EMPLOYED: PERHAPS THIS WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THOSE DAYS, A REAL DISCOVERY? THE ‚ÄÚWILL TO MUTUAL AID,‚ÄÙ TO THE FORMATION OF A HERD, TO ‚ÄÚCOMMUNITY,‚ÄÙ TO ‚ÄÚCONGREGATION,‚ÄÙ CALLED UP IN THIS WAY IS BOUND TO LEAD TO FRESH AND FAR MORE FUNDAMENTAL OUTBURSTS OF THAT WILL TO POWER WHICH IT HAS, EVEN IF ONLY TO A SMALL EXTENT, AROUSED: THE FORMATION OF A HERD IS A SIGNIFICANT VICTORY AND ADVANCE IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DEPRESSION. WITH THE GROWTH OF THE COMMUNITY, A NEW INTEREST GROWS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL, TOO, AND OFTEN LIFTS HIM ABOVE THE MOST PERSONAL ELEMENT IN HIS DISCONTENT, HIS AVERSION TO HIMSELF (GEULINCX‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚDESPECTIO SUI‚ÄÙ).2 ALL THE SICK AND SICKLY INSTINCTIVELY STRIVE AFTER A HERD ORGANIZATION AS A MEANS OF SHAKING OFF THEIR DULL DISPLEASURE AND FEELING OF WEAKNESS: THE ASCETIC PRIEST DIVINES THIS INSTINCT AND FURTHERS IT; WHEREVER THERE ARE HERDS, IT IS THE INSTINCT OF WEAKNESS THAT HAS WILLED THE HERD AND THE PRUDENCE OF THE PRIEST THAT HAS ORGANIZED IT. FOR ONE SHOULD NOT OVERLOOK THIS FACT: THE STRONG ARE AS NATURALLY INCLINED TO SEPARATE AS THE WEAK ARE TO CONGREGATE; IF THE FORMER UNITE TOGETHER, IT IS ONLY WITH THE AIM OF AN AGGRESSIVE COLLECTIVE ACTION AND COLLECTIVE SATISFACTION OF THEIR WILL TO POWER, AND WITH MUCH RESISTANCE FROM THE INDIVIDUAL CONSCIENCE; THE LATTER, ON THE CONTRARY, ENJOY PRECISELY THIS COMING TOGETHER‚ÄÎTHEIR INSTINCT IS JUST AS MUCH SATISFIED BY THIS AS THE INSTINCT OF THE BORN ‚ÄÚMASTERS‚ÄÙ (THAT IS, THE SOLITARY, BEAST-OF-PREY SPECIES OF MAN) IS FUNDAMENTALLY IRRITATED AND DISQUIETED BY ORGANIZATION. THE WHOLE OF HISTORY TEACHES THAT EVERY OLIGARCHY CONCEALS THE LUST FOR TYRANNY; EVERY OLIGARCHY CONSTANTLY TREMBLES WITH THE TENSION EACH MEMBER FEELS IN MAINTAINING CONTROL OVER THIS LUST. (SO IT WAS IN GREECE, FOR INSANCE: PLATO BEARS WITNESS TO IT IN A HUNDRED PASSAGES‚ÄÎAND HE KNEW HIS OWN KIND‚ÄÎAND HIMSELF‚Ä¶)

THE MEANS EMPLOYED BY THE ASCETIC PRIEST THAT WE HAVE DISCOVERED UP TO NOW‚ÄÎTHE GENERAL MUTING OF THE FEELING OF LIFE, MECHANICAL ACTIVITY, THE PETTY PLEASURE, ABOVE ALL ‚ÄÚLOVE OF ONE‚ÄÔS NEIGHBOR,‚ÄÙ HERD ORGANIZATION, THE AWAKENING OF THE COMMUNAL FEELING OF POWER THROUGH WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL‚ÄÔS DISCONTENT WITH HIMSELF IS DROWNED IN HIS PLEASURE IN THE PROSPERITY OF THE COMMUNITY‚ÄÎTHESE ARE, BY MODERN STANDARDS, HRS INNOCENT MEANS IN THE STRUGGLE WITH DISPLEASURE; LET US NOW TURN TO THE MORE INTERESTING MEANS, THE ‚ÄÚGUILTY‚ÄÙ ONES. THEY ALL INVOLVE ONE THING: SOME KIND OF AN ORGY OF FEELING‚ÄÎEMPLOYED AS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF DEADENING DULL, PARALYZING, PROTRACTED PAIN; HENCE PRIESTLY INVENTIVENESS IN THINKING THROUGH THIS SINGLE QUESTION‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚHOW CAN ONE PRODUCE AN ORGY OF FEELING?‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHAS BEEN VIRTUALLY INEXHAUSTIBLE.

THIS SOUNDS HARSH; OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD SOUND MORE PLEASANT AND BE MORE INGRATIATING IF I SAID: ‚ÄÚTHE ASCETIC PRIEST HAS AT ALL TIMES MADE USE OF THE ENTHUSIASM THAT LIES IN ALL STRONG AFFECTS.‚ÄÙ BUT WHY STROKE THE EFFEMINATE EARS OF OUR MODERN WEAKLINGS? WHY SHOULD WE GIVE WAY EVEN ONE STEP TO THEIR TARTUFFERY OF WORDS? FOR US PSYCHOLOGISTS THIS WOULD CONSTITUTE A TARTUFFERY IN DEED, QUITE APART FROM THE FACT THAT IT WOULD NAUSEATE US. FOR IF A PSYCHOLOGIST TODAY HAS GOOD TASTE (OTHERS MIGHT SAY, INTEGRITY) IT CONSISTS IN RESISTANCE TO THE SHAMEFULLY MORALIZED WAY OF SPEAKING WHICH HAS GRADUALLY MADE ALL MODERN JUDGMENTS OF MEN AND THINGS SLIMY.1 ONE SHOULD NOT DECEIVE ONESELF IN THIS MATTER: THE MOST DISTINCTIVE FEATURE OF MODERN SOULS AND MODERN BOOKS IS NOT LYING BUT THEIR INVETERATE INNOCENCE IN MORALISTIC MENDACIOUSNESS. TO HAVE TO REDISCOVER THIS ‚ÄÚINNOCENCE‚ÄÙ EVERYWHERE‚ÄÎTHIS CONSTITUTES PERHAPS THE MOST DISGUSTING JOB AMONG ALL THE PRECARIOUS TASKS A PSYCHOLOGIST HAS TO TACKLE TODAY; IT IS A PART OF OUR GREAT DANGER‚ÄÎIT IS A PATH THAT MAY LEAD PRECISELY US TOWARD GREAT NAUSEA.

I HAVE NO DOUBT FOR WHAT SOLE PURPOSE MODERN BOOKS (IF THEY LAST, WHICH WE FORTUNATELY HAVE LITTLE REASON TO FEAR, AND IF THERE WILL ONE DAY BE A POSTERITY WITH A MORE SEVERE, HARDER, HEALTHIER TASTE)‚ÄÎFOR WHAT PURPOSE EVERYTHING MODERN WILL SERVE THIS POSTERITY: AS AN EMETIC‚ÄÎAND THAT ON ACCOUNT OF ITS MORAL MAWKISHNESS AND FALSENESS, ITS INNERMOST FEMINISM THAT LIKES TO CALL ITSELF ‚ÄÚIDEALISM‚ÄÙ AND AT ANY RATE BELIEVES IT IS IDEALISM. OUR EDUCATED PEOPLE OF TODAY, OUR ‚ÄÚGOOD PEOPLE,‚ÄÙ DO NOT TELL LIES‚ÄÎTHAT IS TRUE; BUT THAT IS NOT TO THEIR CREDIT! A REAL LIE, A GENUINE, RESOLUTE, ‚ÄÚHONEST‚ÄÙ LIE (ON WHOSE VALUE ONE SHOULD CONSULT PLATO) WOULD BE SOMETHING FAR TOO SEVERE AND POTENT FOR THEM: IT WOULD DEMAND OF THEM WHAT ONE MAY NOT DEMAND OF THEM, THAT THEY SHOULD OPEN THEIR EYES TO THEMSELVES, THAT THEY SHOULD KNOW HOW TO DISTINGUISH ‚ÄÚTRUE‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚFALSE‚ÄÙ IN THEMSELVES. ALL THEY ARE CAPABLE OF IS A DISHONEST LIE; WHOEVER TODAY ACCOUNTS HIMSELF A ‚ÄÚGOOD MAN‚ÄÙ IS UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF CONFRONTING ANY MATTER EXCEPT WITH DISHONEST MENDACIOUSNESS‚ÄÎA MENDACIOUSNESS THAT IS ABYSMAL BUT INNOCENT, TRUEHEARTED, BLUE-EYED, AND VIRTUOUS. THESE ‚ÄÚGOOD MEN‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHEY ARE ONE AND ALL MORALIZED TO THE VERY DEPTHS AND RUINED AND BOTCHED TO ALL ETERNITY AS FAR AS HONESTY IS CONCERNED: WHO AMONG THEM COULD ENDURE A SINGLE TRUTH ‚ÄÚABOUT MAN‚ÄÙ? OR, PUT MORE PALPABLY: WHO AMONG THEM COULD STAND A TRUE BIOGRAPHY?

A COUPLE OF POINTERS: LORD BYRON WROTE A NUMBER OF VERY PERSONAL THINGS ABOUT HIMSELF, BUT THOMAS MOORE WAS ‚ÄÚTOO GOOD‚ÄÙ FOR THEM: HE BURNED HIS FRIEND‚ÄÔS PAPERS.2 DR. GWINNER, SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS EXECUTOR, IS SAID TO HAVE DONE THE SAME:3 FOR SCHOPENHAUER, TOO, HAD WRITTEN A FEW THINGS ABOUT HIMSELF AND PERHAPS AGAINST HIMSELF (EIS HEAUTON4). THE SOLID AMERICAN, THAYER, BEETHOVEN‚ÄÔS BIOGRAPHER, SUDDENLY CALLED A HALT TO HIS WORK: AT SOME POINT OR OTHER IN THIS VENERABLE AND NA√ØVE LIFE HE COULD NO LONGER TAKE IT.5

MORAL: WHAT PRUDENT MAN WOULD WRITE A SINGLE HONEST WORD ABOUT HIMSELF TODAY?‚ÄÎHE WOULD HAVE TO BE A MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF HOLY FOOLHARDINESS TO DO SO. WE ARE PROMISED AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF RICHARD WAGNER: WHO DOUBTS THAT IT WILL BE A PRUDENT AUTOBIOGRAPHY?

LET US FINALLY MENTION THAT LUDICROUS HORROR AROUSED IN GERMANY BY THE CATHOLIC PRIEST JANSSEN WITH HIS INCOMPARABLY ARTLESS AND INNOCUOUS PICTURE OF THE REFORMATION MOVEMENT. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SOMEONE WERE TO DESCRIBE THIS MOVEMENT DIFFERENTLY, IF A REAL PSYCHOLOGIST WERE TO DESCRIBE A REAL LUTHER, NOT WITH THE MORALISTIC SIMPLICITY OF A COUNTRY PARSON, NOT WITH THE SICKLY AND DISCREET BASHFULNESS OF A PROTESTANT HISTORIAN, BUT, SAY, WITH THE INTREPIDITY OF A TAINE, OUT OF STRENGTH OF SOUL AND NOT OUT OF A PRUDENT INDULGENCE TOWARD STRENGTH?6 (THE GERMANS, INCIDENTALLY, HAVE FINALLY PRODUCED A BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE OF THE CLASSICAL TYPE OF THE LATTER‚ÄÎTHEY MAY WELL CLAIM HIM AS ONE OF THEIR OWN AND BE PROUD OF HIM: LEOPOLD RANKE,7 THAT BORN CLASSICAL ADVOCATUS OF EVERY CAUSA FORTIOR8 THAT MOST PRUDENT OF ALL PRUDENT ‚ÄÚREALISTS.‚ÄÙ)





20


BUT MY POINT WILL HAVE BEEN TAKEN‚ÄÎTHERE IS REASON ENOUGH, IS THERE NOT, FOR US PSYCHOLOGISTS NOWADAYS TO BE UNABLE TO SHAKE OFF A CERTAIN MISTRUST OF OURSELVES.

PROBABLY, WE, TOO, ARE STILL ‚ÄÚTOO GOOD‚ÄÙ FOR OUR JOB; PROBABLY, WE, TOO, ARE STILL VICTIMS OF AND PREY TO THIS MORALIZED CONTEMPORARY TASTE AND ILL WITH IT, HOWEVER MUCH WE THINK WE DESPISE IT‚ÄÎPROBABLY IT INFECTS EVEN US. WHAT WAS THE WARNING THAT DIPLOMAT GAVE HIS COLLEAGUES? ‚ÄÚLET US ABOVE ALL MISTRUST OUR FIRST IMPULSES, GENTLEMEN!‚ÄÙ HE SAID; ‚ÄÚTHEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS GOOD.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHUS SHOULD EVERY PSYCHOLOGIST, TOO, ADDRESS HIS COLLEAGUES TODAY.

AND WITH THAT WE RETURN TO OUR PROBLEM, WHICH IN FACT DEMANDS A CERTAIN SEVERITY OF US, ESPECIALLY A CERTAIN MISTRUST OF ‚ÄÚFIRST IMPULSES.‚ÄÙ THE ASCETIC IDEAL EMPLOYED TO PRODUCE ORGIES OF FEELING‚ÄÎWHOEVER RECALLS THE PRECEDING ESSAY WILL ANTICIPATE FROM THESE NINE WORDS THE ESSENCE OF WHAT IS NOW TO BE SHOWN. TO WRENCH THE HUMAN SOUL FROM ITS MOORINGS, TO IMMERSE IT IN TERRORS, ICE, FLAMES, AND RAPTURES TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT IS LIBERATED FROM ALL PETTY DISPLEASURE, GLOOM, AND DEPRESSION AS BY A FLASH OF LIGHTNING: WHAT PATHS LEAD TO THIS GOAL? AND WHICH OF THEM DO SO MOST SURELY?

FUNDAMENTALLY, EVERY GREAT AFFECT HAS THIS POWER, PROVIDED IT EXPLODES SUDDENLY: ANGER, FEAR, VOLUPTUOUSNESS, REVENGE, HOPE, TRIUMPH, DESPAIR, CRUELTY; AND THE ASCETIC PRIEST HAS INDEED PRESSED INTO HIS SERVICE INDISCRIMINATELY THE WHOLE PACK OF SAVAGE HOUNDS IN MAN AND LET LOOSE NOW THIS ONE AND NOW THAT, ALWAYS WITH THE SAME END IN VIEW: TO AWAKEN MEN FROM THEIR SLOW MELANCHOLY, TO HUNT AWAY, IF ONLY FOR A TIME, THEIR DULL PAIN AND LINGERING MISERY, AND ALWAYS UNDER COVER OF A RELIGIOUS INTERPRETATION AND ‚ÄÚJUSTIFICATION.‚ÄÙ EVERY SUCH ORGY OF FEELING HAS TO BE PAID FOR AFTERWARD, THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING‚ÄÎIT MAKES THE SICK SICKER; AND THAT IS WHY THIS KIND OF CURE FOR PAIN IS, BY MODERN STANDARDS, ‚ÄÚGUILTY.‚ÄÙ YET, TO BE FAIR, ONE MUST INSIST ALL THE MORE THAT IT WAS EMPLOYED WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE, THAT THE ASCETIC PRIEST PRESCRIBED IT IN THE PROFOUNDEST FAITH IN ITS UTILITY, INDEED INDISPENSABILITY‚ÄÎAND EVEN THAT HE WAS OFTEN ALMOST SHATTERED BY THE MISERY HE HAD CAUSED; ONE MUST ALSO ADD THAT THE VIOLENT PHYSIOLOGICAL REVENGE TAKEN BY SUCH EXCESSES, INCLUDING EVEN MENTAL DISTURBANCES, DOES NOT REALLY CONFUTE THE SENSE OF THIS KIND OF MEDICATION, WHICH, AS HAS BEEN SHOWN ABOVE, DOES NOT AIM AT CURING THE SICKNESS BUT AT COMBATING THE DEPRESSION BY RELIEVING AND DEADENING ITS DISPLEASURE. THIS IS ONE WAY OF ATTAINING THAT END.

THE CHIEF TRICK THE ASCETIC PRIEST PERMITTED HIMSELF FOR MAKING THE HUMAN SOUL RESOUND WITH HEART-RENDING, ECSTATIC MUSIC OF ALL KINDS WAS, AS EVERYONE KNOWS, THE EXPLOITATION OF THE SENSE OF GUILT. ITS ORIGIN HAS BEEN BRIEFLY SUGGESTED IN THE PRECEDING ESSAY‚ÄÎAS A PIECE OF ANIMAL PSYCHOLOGY, NO MORE: THERE WE ENCOUNTERED THE SENSE OF GUILT IN ITS RAW STATE, SO TO SPEAK. IT WAS ONLY IN THE HANDS OF THE PRIEST, THAT ARTIST IN GUILT FEELINGS, THAT IT ACHIEVED FORM‚ÄÎOH, WHAT A FORM! ‚ÄÚSIN‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎFOR THIS IS THE PRIESTLY NAME FOR THE ANIMAL‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚBAD CONSCIENCE‚ÄÙ (CRUELTY DIRECTED BACKWARD)‚ÄÎHAS BEEN THE GREATEST EVENT SO FAR IN THE HISTORY OF THE SICK SOUL: WE POSSESS IN IT THE MOST DANGEROUS AND FATEFUL ARTIFICE OF RELIGIOUS INTERPRETATION. MAN, SUFFERING FROM HIMSELF IN SOME WAY OR OTHER BUT IN ANY CASE PHYSIOLOGICALLY LIKE AN ANIMAL SHUT UP IN A CAGE, UNCERTAIN WHY OR WHEREFORE, THIRSTING FOR REASONS‚ÄÎREASONS RELIEVE‚ÄÎTHIRSTING, TOO, FOR REMEDIES AND NARCOTICS, AT LAST TAKES COUNSEL WITH ONE WHO KNOWS HIDDEN THINGS, TOO‚ÄÎAND BEHOLD! HE RECEIVES A HINT, HE RECEIVES FROM HIS SORCERER, THE ASCETIC PRIEST, THE FIRST HINT AS TO THE ‚ÄÚCAUSE‚ÄÙ OF HIS SUFFERING: HE MUST SEEK IT IN HIMSELF, IN SOME GUILT, IN A PIECE OF THE PAST, HE MUST UNDERSTAND HIS SUFFERING AS A PUNISHMENT.

HE HAS HEARD, HE HAS UNDERSTOOD, THIS UNFORTUNATE: FROM NOW ON HE IS LIKE A HEN IMPRISONED BY A CHALK LINE. HE CAN NO LONGER GET OUT OF THIS CHALK CIRCLE: THE INVALID HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO ‚ÄÚTHE SINNER.‚ÄÙ

FOR TWO MILLENNIA NOW WE HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED TO THE SIGHT OF THIS NEW TYPE OF INVALID, ‚ÄÚTHE SINNER‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎSHALL IT ALWAYS BE SO?‚ÄÎEVERYWHERE ONE LOOKS THERE IS THE HYPNOTIC GAZE OF THE SINNER, ALWAYS FIXED ON THE SAME OBJECT (ON ‚ÄÚGUILT‚ÄÙ AS THE SOLE CAUSE OF SUFFERING); EVERYWHERE THE BAD CONSCIENCE, THAT ‚ÄÚABOMINABLE BEAST,‚ÄÙ AS LUTHER CALLED IT; EVERYWHERE THE PAST REGURGITATED, THE FACT DISTORTED, THE ‚ÄÚJAUNDICED EYE‚ÄÙ FOR ALL ACTION; EVERYWHERE THE WILL TO MISUNDERSTAND SUFFERING MADE THE CONTENT OF LIFE, THE REINTERPRETATION OF SUFFERING AS FEELINGS OF GUILT, FEAR, AND PUNISHMENT; EVERYWHERE THE SCOURGE, THE HAIR SHIRT, THE STARVING BODY, CONTRITION; EVERYWHERE THE SINNER BREAKING HIMSELF ON THE CRUEL WHEEL OF A RESTLESS, MORBIDLY LASCIVIOUS CONSCIENCE; EVERYWHERE DUMB TORMENT, EXTREME FEAR, THE AGONY OF THE TORTURED HEART, CONVULSIONS OF AN UNKNOWN HAPPINESS, THE CRY FOR ‚ÄÚREDEMPTION.‚ÄÙ THE OLD DEPRESSION, HEAVINESS, AND WEARINESS WERE INDEED OVERCOME THROUGH THIS SYSTEM OF PROCEDURES; LIFE AGAIN BECAME VERY INTERESTING: AWAKE, EVERLASTINGLY AWAKE, SLEEPLESS, GLOWING, CHARRED, SPENT AND YET NOT WEARY‚ÄÎTHUS WAS THE MAN, ‚ÄÚTHE SINNER,‚ÄÙ INITIATED INTO THIS MYSTERY. THIS ANCIENT MIGHTY SORCERER IN HIS STRUGGLE WITH DISPLEASURE, THE ASCETIC PRIEST‚ÄÎHE HAD OBVIOUSLY WON, HIS KINGDOM HAD COME: ONE NO LONGER PROTESTED AGAINST PAIN, ONE THIRSTED FOR PAIN; ‚ÄÚMORE PAIN! MORE PAIN!‚ÄÙ THE DESIRE OF HIS DISCIPLES AND INITIATES HAS CRIED FOR CENTURIES. EVERY PAINFUL ORGY OF FEELING, EVERYTHING THAT SHATTERED, BOWLED OVER, CRUSHED, ENRAPTURED, TRANSPORTED; THE SECRETS OF THE TORTURE CHAMBER, THE INVENTIVENESS OF HELL ITSELF‚ÄÎALL WERE HENCEFORTH DISCOVERED, DIVINED, AND EXPLOITED, ALL STOOD IN THE SERVICE OF THE SORCERER, ALL SERVED HENCEFORWARD TO PROMOTE THE VICTORY OF HIS IDEAL, THE ASCETIC IDEAL.‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚMY KINGDOM IS NOT OF THIS WORLD‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHE CONTINUED TO SAY, AS BEFORE: BUT DID HE STILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY IT?

GOETHE CLAIMED THERE WERE ONLY THIRTY-SIX TRAGIC SITUATIONS: ONE COULD GUESS FROM THAT, IF ONE DID NOT KNOW IT ANYWAY, THAT GOETHE WAS NO ASCETIC PRIEST. HE‚ÄÎKNOWS MORE.‚ÄÎ

IT WOULD BE POINTLESS TO INDULGE IN CRITICISM OF THIS KIND OF PRIESTLY MEDICATION, THE ‚ÄÚGUILTY‚ÄÙ KIND. WHO WOULD WANT TO MAINTAIN THAT SUCH ORGIES OF FEELING AS THE ASCETIC PRIEST PRESCRIBED FOR HIS SICK PEOPLE (UNDER THE HOLIEST NAMES, AS GOES WITHOUT SAYING, AND CONVINCED OF THE HOLINESS OF HIS ENDS) EVER BENEFITED ANY OF THEM? AT LEAST WE SHOULD BE CLEAR ON THE MEANING OF THE WORD ‚ÄÚBENEFIT.‚ÄÙ IF ONE INTENDS IT TO CONVEY THAT SUCH A SYSTEM OF TREATMENT HAS IMPROVED MEN, I SHALL NOT ARGUE: ONLY I SHOULD HAVE TO ADD WHAT ‚ÄÚIMPROVED‚ÄÙ SIGNIFIES TO ME‚ÄÎTHE SAME THING AS ‚ÄÚTAMED,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚWEAKENED,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚDISCOURAGED,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚMADE REFINED,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚMADE EFFETE,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚEMASCULATED‚ÄÙ (THUS ALMOST THE SAME THING AS HARMED.) BUT WHEN SUCH A SYSTEM IS CHIEFLY APPLIED TO THE SICK, DISTRESSED, AND DEPRESSED, IT INVARIABLY MAKES THEM SICKER, EVEN IF IT DOES ‚ÄÚIMPROVE‚ÄÙ THEM; ONE NEED ONLY ASK PSYCHIATRISTS1 WHAT HAPPENS TO PATIENTS WHO ARE METHODICALLY SUBJECTED TO THE TORMENTS OF REPENTANCE, STATES OF CONTRITION, AND FITS OF REDEMPTION. ONE SHOULD ALSO CONSULT HISTORY: WHEREVER THE ASCETIC PRIEST HAS PREVAILED WITH THIS TREATMENT, SICKNESS HAS SPREAD IN DEPTH AND BREADTH WITH ASTONISHING SPEED. WHAT HAS ALWAYS CONSTITUTED ITS ‚ÄÚSUCCESS‚ÄÙ? A SHATTERED NERVOUS SYSTEM ADDED TO ANY EXISTING ILLNESS‚ÄÎAND THIS ON THE LARGEST AS ON THE SMALLEST SCALE, IN INDIVIDUALS AS IN MASSES.

IN THE WAKE OF REPENTANCE AND REDEMPTION TRAINING WE FIND TREMENDOUS EPILEPTIC EPIDEMICS, THE GREATEST KNOWN TO HISTORY, SUCH AS THE ST. VITUS‚ÄÔ AND ST. JOHN‚ÄÔS DANCES OF THE MIDDLE AGES; AS ANOTHER AFTEREFFECT WE ENCOUNTER TERRIBLE PARALYSES AND PROTRACTED STATES OF DEPRESSION, WHICH SOMETIMES TRANSFORM THE TEMPERAMENT OF A PEOPLE OR A CITY (GENEVA, BASEL) ONCE AND FOR ALL INTO ITS OPPOSITE; HERE WE MAY ALSO INCLUDE THE WITCH-HUNT HYSTERIA, SOMETHING RELATED TO SOMNAMBULISM (THERE WERE EIGHT GREAT EPIDEMIC OUTBREAKS OF THIS BETWEEN 1564 AND 1605 ALONE); WE ALSO FIND IN ITS WAKE THOSE DEATH-SEEKING MASS DELIRIA WHOSE DREADFUL CRY ‚ÄÚEVVIVA LA MORTE!2 WAS HEARD ALL OVER EUROPE, INTERSPERSED NOW WITH VOLUPTUOUS IDIOSYNCRASIES, NOW WITH RAGES OF DESTRUCTION; AND THE SAME ALTERNATION OF AFFECTS, ACCOMPANIED BY THE SAME INTERMISSIONS AND SOMERSAULTS, IS TO BE OBSERVED EVEN TODAY WHENEVER THE ASCETIC DOCTRINE OF SIN AGAIN ACHIEVES A GRAND SUCCESS. (THE RELIGIOUS NEUROSIS APPEARS AS A FORM OF EVIL; THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. WHAT IS IT? QUAERITUR.3) BROADLY SPEAKING, THE ASCETIC IDEAL AND ITS SUBLIMELY MORAL CULT, THIS MOST INGENIOUS, UNSCRUPULOUS, AND DANGEROUS SYSTEMATIZATION OF ALL THE MEANS FOR PRODUCING ORGIES OF FEELING UNDER THE COVER OF HOLY INTENTIONS, HAS INSCRIBED ITSELF IN A FEARFUL AND UNFORGETTABLE WAY IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF MAN‚ÄÎAND UNFORTUNATELY NOT ONLY IN HIS HISTORY.

I KNOW OF HARDLY ANYTHING ELSE THAT HAS HAD SO DESTRUCTIVE AN EFFECT UPON THE HEALTH AND RACIAL STRENGTH OF EUROPEANS AS THIS IDEAL; ONE MAY WITHOUT ANY EXAGGERATION CALL IT THE TRUE CALAMITY IN THE HISTORY OF EUROPEAN HEALTH. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN BE COMPARED WITH ITS INFLUENCE IS THE SPECIFICALLY TEUTONIC INFLUENCE: I MEAN THE ALCOHOLIC POISONING OF EUROPE, WHICH HAS HITHERTO GONE STRICTLY IN STEP WITH THE POLITICAL AND RACIAL HEGEMONY OF THE TEUTONS (WHEREVER THEY INFUSED THEIR BLOOD THEY ALSO INFUSED THEIR VICE).‚ÄÎTHIRD IN LINE WOULD BE SYPHILIS‚ÄÎMAGNO SED PROXIMA INTER-VALLO.4

THE ASCETIC PRIEST HAS RUINED PSYCHICAL HEALTH WHEREVER HE HAS COME TO POWER; CONSEQUENTLY HE HAS ALSO RUINED TASTE IN ARTIBUS ET LITTERIS1‚ÄÎHE IS STILL RUINING IT. ‚ÄÚCONSEQUENTLY?‚ÄÙ I HOPE I SHALL BE GRANTED THIS ‚ÄÚCONSEQUENTLY;‚ÄÙ AT ANY RATE, I DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO BOTHER TO PROVE IT. JUST ONE POINTER: IT CONCERNS THE BASIC BOOK OF CHRISTIAN LITERATURE, ITS MODEL, ITS ‚ÄÚBOOK IN ITSELF.‚ÄÙ EVEN IN THE MIDST OF GRAECO-ROMAN SPLENDOR, WHICH WAS ALSO A SPLENDOR OF BOOKS, IN THE FACE OF AN ANCIENT LITERARY WORLD THAT HAD NOT YET ERODED AND BEEN RUINED, AT A TIME WHEN ONE COULD STILL READ SOME BOOKS FOR WHOSE POSSESSION ONE WOULD NOWADAYS EXCHANGE HALF OF SOME NATIONAL LITERATURES, THE SIMPLICITY AND VANITY OF CHRISTIAN AGITATORS‚ÄÎTHEY ARE CALLED CHURCH FATHERS‚ÄÎHAD THE TEMERITY TO DECLARE: ‚ÄÚWE, TOO, HAVE A CLASSICAL LITERATURE, WE HAVE NO NEED OF THAT OF THE GREEKS‚ÄÙ; AND SAYING THIS THEY POINTED PROUDLY TO BOOKS OF LEGENDS, LETTERS OF APOSTLES, AND APOLOGETIC TRACTS, RATHER AS THE ENGLISH ‚ÄÚSALVATION ARMY‚ÄÙ TODAY EMPLOYS SIMILAR LITERATURE IN ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST SHAKESPEARE AND OTHER ‚ÄÚPAGANS.‚ÄÙ

I DO NOT LIKE THE ‚ÄÚNEW TESTAMENT,‚ÄÙ THAT SHOULD BE PLAIN; I FIND IT ALMOST DISTURBING THAT MY TASTE IN REGARD TO THIS MOST HIGHLY ESTEEMED AND OVERESTIMATED WORK SHOULD BE SO SINGULAR (I HAVE THE TASTE OF TWO MILLENNIA AGAINST ME): BUT THERE IT IS! ‚ÄÚHERE I STAND, I CANNOT DO OTHERWISE‚ÄÙ2‚ÄÎI HAVE THE COURAGE OF MY BAD TASTE. THE OLD TESTAMENT‚ÄÎTHAT IS SOMETHING ELSE AGAIN: ALL HONOR TO THE OLD TESTAMENT! I FIND IN IT GREAT HUMAN BEINGS, A HEROIC LANDSCAPE, AND SOMETHING OF THE VERY RAREST QUALITY IN THE WORLD, THE INCOMPARABLE NA√ØVET√© OF THE STRONG HEART; WHAT IS MORE, I FIND A PEOPLE. IN THE NEW ONE, ON THE OTHER HAND, I FIND NOTHING BUT PETTY SECTARIANISM, MERE ROCOCO OF THE SOUL, MERE INVOLUTIONS, NOOKS, QUEER THINGS, THE AIR OF THE CONVENTICLE, NOT TO FORGET AN OCCASIONAL WHIFF OF BUCOLIC MAWKISHNESS THAT BELONGS TO THE EPOCH (AND TO THE ROMAN PROVINCE) AND IS NOT SO MUCH JEWISH AS HELLENISTIC. HUMILITY AND SELF-IMPORTANCE CHEEK-BY-JOWL; A GARRULOUSNESS OF FEELING THAT ALMOST STUPEFIES; IMPASSIONED VEHEMENCE, NOT PASSION; EMBARRASSING GESTICULATION; IT IS PLAIN THAT THERE IS NO TRACE OF GOOD BREEDING. HOW CAN ONE MAKE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT ONE‚ÄÔS LITTLE LAPSES AS THESE PIOUS LITTLE MEN DO! WHO GIVES A DAMN? CERTAINLY NOT GOD. FINALLY, THEY EVEN WANT ‚ÄÚTHE CROWN OF ETERNAL LIFE,‚ÄÙ THESE LITTLE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE; BUT FOR WHAT? TO WHAT PURPOSE? PRESUMPTION CAN GO NO FURTHER. AN ‚ÄÚIMMORTAL‚ÄÙ PETER: WHO COULD STAND HIM? THEIR AMBITION IS LAUGHABLE: PEOPLE OF THAT SORT REGURGITATING THEIR MOST PRIVATE AFFAIRS, THEIR STUPIDITIES, SORROWS, AND PETTY WORRIES, AS IF THE HEART OF BEING WERE OBLIGED TO CONCERN ITSELF WITH THEM; THEY NEVER GROW TIRED OF INVOLVING GOD HIMSELF IN EVEN THE PETTIEST TROUBLES THEY HAVE GOT THEMSELVES INTO. AND THE APPALLING TASTE OF THIS PERPETUAL FAMILIARITY WITH GOD! THIS JEWISH AND NOT MERELY JEWISH OBTRUSIVENESS OF PAWING AND NUZZLING GOD!

THERE ARE DESPISED LITTLE ‚ÄÚPAGAN NATIONS‚ÄÙ IN EASTERN ASIA FROM WHOM THESE FIRST CHRISTIANS COULD HAVE LEARNED SOMETHING IMPORTANT, SOME TACT IN REVERENCE; AS CHRISTIAN MISSIONARIES WITNESS, THESE NATIONS DO NOT EVEN UTTER THE NAME OF THEIR GOD. THIS SEEMS TO ME DELICATE ENOUGH; IT IS CERTAINLY TOO DELICATE NOT ONLY FOR ‚ÄÚFIRST‚ÄÙ CHRISTIANS: TO SEE THE FULL CONTRAST, ONE SHOULD RECALL LUTHER, FOR INSTANCE, THAT ‚ÄÚMOST ELOQUENT‚ÄÙ AND PRESUMPTUOUS PEASANT GERMANY HAS EVER PRODUCED, AND THE TONE HE PREFERRED WHEN CONVERSING WITH GOD. LUTHER‚ÄÔS ATTACK ON THE MEDIATING SAINTS OF THE CHURCH (AND ESPECIALLY ON ‚ÄÚTHE DEVIL‚ÄÔS SOW, THE POPE‚ÄÙ) WAS, BEYOND ANY DOUBT, FUNDAMENTALLY THE ATTACK OF A LOUT WHO COULD NOT STOMACH THE GOOD ETIQUETTE OF THE CHURCH, THAT REVERENTIAL ETIQUETTE OF THE HIERATIC TASTE WHICH PERMITS ONLY THE MORE INITIATED AND SILENT INTO THE HOLY OF HOLIES AND CLOSES IT TO LOUTS. HERE OF ALL PLACES THE LOUTS WERE TO BE KEPT FROM RAISING THEIR VOICES; BUT LUTHER, THE PEASANT, WANTED IT ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT: THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS NOT GERMAN ENOUGH FOR HIM: HE WANTED ABOVE ALL TO SPEAK DIRECTLY, TO SPEAK HIMSELF, TO SPEAK ‚ÄÚINFORMALLY‚ÄÙ WITH HIS GOD.‚ÄÎWELL, HE DID IT.

IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT THE ASCETIC IDEAL HAS NEVER AND NOWHERE BEEN A SCHOOL OF GOOD TASTE, EVEN LESS OF GOOD MANNERS‚ÄÎAT BEST IT WAS A SCHOOL OF HIERATIC MANNERS: THAT IS BECAUSE ITS VERY NATURE INCLUDES SOMETHING THAT IS THE DEADLY ENEMY OF ALL GOOD MANNERS‚ÄÎLACK OF MODERATION, DISLIKE OF MODERATION; IT ITSELF IS A ‚ÄÚNON PLUS ULTRA.‚ÄÙ3

THE ASCETIC IDEAL HAS NOT ONLY RUINED HEALTH AND TASTE, IT HAS ALSO RUINED A THIRD, FOURTH, FIFTH, SIXTH THING AS WELL‚ÄÎI BEWARE OF ENUMERATING EVERYTHING (I‚ÄÔD NEVER FINISH). IT IS MY PURPOSE HERE TO BRING TO LIGHT, NOT WHAT THIS IDEAL HAS DONE, BUT SIMPLY WHAT IT MEANS; WHAT IT INDICATES; WHAT LIES HIDDEN BEHIND IT, BENEATH IT, IN IT; OF WHAT IT IS THE PROVISIONAL, INDISTINCT EXPRESSION, OVERLAID WITH QUESTION MARKS AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS. AND IT IS ONLY IN PURSUIT OF THIS END THAT I COULD NOT SPARE MY READERS A GLANCE AT ITS MONSTROUS AND CALAMITOUS EFFECTS, TO PREPARE THEM FOR THE ULTIMATE AND MOST TERRIFYING ASPECT OF THE QUESTION CONCERNING THE MEANING OF THIS IDEAL. WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE POWER OF THIS IDEAL, THE MONSTROUS NATURE OF ITS POWER? WHY HAS IT BEEN ALLOWED TO FLOURISH TO THIS EXTENT? WHY HAS IT NOT RATHER BEEN RESISTED? THE ASCETIC IDEAL EXPRESSES A WILL: WHERE IS THE OPPOSING WILL THAT MIGHT EXPRESS AN OPPOSING IDEAL! THE ASCETIC IDEAL HAS A GOAL‚ÄÎTHIS GOAL IS SO UNIVERSAL THAT ALL THE OTHER INTERESTS OF HUMAN EXISTENCE SEEM, WHEN COMPARED WITH IT, PETTY AND NARROW; IT INTERPRETS EPOCHS, NATIONS, AND MEN INEXORABLY WITH A VIEW TO THIS ONE GOAL; IT PERMITS NO OTHER INTERPRETATION, NO OTHER GOAL; IT REJECTS, DENIES, AFFIRMS, AND SANCTIONS SOLELY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ITS INTERPRETATION (AND HAS THERE EVER BEEN A SYSTEM OF INTERPRETATION MORE THOROUGHLY THOUGHT THROUGH?); IT SUBMITS TO NO POWER, IT BELIEVES IN ITS OWN PREDOMINANCE OVER EVERY OTHER POWER, IN ITS ABSOLUTE SUPERIORITY OF RANK OVER EVERY OTHER POWER‚ÄÎIT BELIEVES THAT NO POWER EXISTS ON EARTH THAT DOES NOT FIRST HAVE TO RECEIVE A MEANING, A RIGHT TO EXIST, A VALUE, AS A TOOL OF THE ASCETIC IDEAL, AS A WAY AND MEANS TO ITS GOAL, TO ONE GOAL.‚ÄÎWHERE IS THE MATCH OF THIS CLOSED SYSTEM OF WILL, GOAL, AND INTERPRETATION? WHY HAS IT NOT FOUND ITS MATCH?‚ÄÎWHERE IS THE OTHER ‚ÄÚONE GOAL‚ÄÙ?

BUT THEY TELL ME IT IS NOT LACKING, IT HAS NOT MERELY WAGED A LONG AND SUCCESSFUL FIGHT AGAINST THIS IDEAL, IT HAS ALREADY CONQUERED THIS IDEAL IN ALL IMPORTANT RESPECTS: ALL OF MODERN SCIENCE1 IS SUPPOSED TO BEAR WITNESS TO THAT‚ÄÎMODERN SCIENCE WHICH, AS A GENUINE PHILOSOPHY OF REALITY, CLEARLY BELIEVES IN ITSELF ALONE, CLEARLY POSSESSES THE COURAGE FOR ITSELF AND THE WILL TO ITSELF, AND HAS UP TO NOW SURVIVED WELL ENOUGH WITHOUT GOD, THE BEYOND, AND THE VIRTUES OF DENIAL. SUCH NOISY AGITATORS‚ÄÔ CHATTER, HOWEVER, DOES NOT IMPRESS ME: THESE TRUMPETERS OF REALITY ARE BAD MUSICIANS, THEIR VOICES OBVIOUSLY DO NOT COME FROM THE DEPTHS, THE ABYSS OF THE SCIENTIFIC CONSCIENCE DOES NOT SPEAK THROUGH THEM‚ÄÎFOR TODAY THE SCIENTIFIC CONSCIENCE IS AN ABYSS‚ÄÎTHE WORD ‚ÄÚSCIENCE‚ÄÙ IN THE MOUTHS OF SUCH TRUMPETERS IS SIMPLY AN INDECENCY, AN ABUSE, AND A PIECE OF IMPUDENCE. THE TRUTH IS PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS ASSERTED HERE: SCIENCE TODAY HAS ABSOLUTELY NO BELIEF IN ITSELF, LET ALONE AN IDEAL ABOVE IT‚ÄÎAND WHERE IT STILL INSPIRES PASSION, LOVE, ARDOR, AND SUFFERING AT ALL, IT IS NOT THE OPPOSITE OF THE ASCETIC IDEAL BUT RATHER THE LATEST AND NOBLEST FORM OF IT. DOES THAT SOUND STRANGE TO YOU?

TODAY THERE ARE PLENTY OF MODEST AND WORTHY LABORERS2 AMONG SCHOLARS, TOO, WHO ARE HAPPY IN THEIR LITTLE NOOKS; AND BECAUSE THEY ARE HAPPY THERE, THEY SOMETIMES DEMAND RATHER IMMODESTLY THAT ONE OUGHT TO BE CONTENT WITH THINGS TODAY, GENERALLY‚ÄÎESPECIALLY IN THE DOMAIN OF SCIENCE, WHERE SO MUCH THAT IS USEFUL REMAINS TO BE DONE. I AM NOT DENYING THAT; THE LAST THING I WANT IS TO DESTROY THE PLEASURE THESE HONEST WORKERS TAKE IN THEIR CRAFT: FOR I APPROVE OF THEIR WORK. BUT THAT ONE WORKS RIGOROUSLY IN THE SCIENCES AND THAT THERE ARE CONTENTED WORKERS CERTAINLY DOES NOT PROVE THAT SCIENCE AS A WHOLE POSSESSES A GOAL, A WILL, AN IDEAL, OR THE PASSION OF A GREAT FAITH. THE OPPOSITE IS THE CASE, TO REPEAT: WHERE IT IS NOT THE LATEST EXPRESSION OF THE ASCETIC IDEAL‚ÄÎAND THE EXCEPTIONS ARE TOO RARE, NOBLE, AND ATYPICAL TO REFUTE THE GENERAL PROPOSITION‚ÄÎSCIENCE TODAY IS A HIDING PLACE FOR EVERY KIND OF DISCONTENT, DISBELIEF, GNAWING WORM, DESPECTIO SUI, BAD CONSCIENCE‚ÄÎIT IS THE UNREST OF THE LACK OF IDEALS, THE SUFFERING FROM THE LACK OF ANY GREAT LOVE, THE DISCONTENT IN THE FACE OF INVOLUNTARY CONTENTMENT.

OH, WHAT DOES SCIENCE NOT CONCEAL TODAY! HOW MUCH, AT ANY RATE, IS IT MEANT TO CONCEAL! THE PROFICIENCY OF OUR FINEST SCHOLARS, THEIR HEEDLESS INDUSTRY, THEIR HEADS SMOKING DAY AND NIGHT, THEIR VERY CRAFTSMANSHIP‚ÄÎHOW OFTEN THE REAL MEANING OF ALL THIS LIES IN THE DESIRE TO KEEP SOMETHING HIDDEN FROM ONESELF! SCIENCE AS A MEANS OF SELF-NARCOSIS: DO YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE OF THAT?

WHOEVER ASSOCIATES WITH SCHOLARS KNOWS THAT ONE OCCASIONALLY WOUNDS THEM TO THE MARROW WITH SOME HARMLESS WORD; ONE INCENSES ONE‚ÄÔS SCHOLARLY FRIENDS JUST WHEN ONE MEANS TO HONOR THEM, ONE CAN DRIVE THEM BESIDE THEMSELVES MERELY BECAUSE ONE HAS BEEN TOO COARSE TO REALIZE WITH WHOM ONE WAS REALLY DEALING‚ÄÎWITH SUFFERERS WHO REFUSE TO ADMIT TO THEMSELVES WHAT THEY ARE, WITH DRUGGED AND HEEDLESS MEN WHO FEAR ONLY ONE THING: REGAINING CONSCIOUSNESS.‚ÄÎ

AND NOW LOOK, ON THE OTHER HAND, AT THOSE RARER CASES OF WHICH I SPOKE, THE LAST IDEALISTS LEFT AMONG PHILOSOPHERS AND SCHOLARS: ARE THEY PERHAPS THE DESIRED OPPONENTS OF THE ASCETIC IDEAL, THE COUNTERIDEALISTS? INDEED, THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE, THESE ‚ÄÚUNBELIEVERS‚ÄÙ (FOR THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE, ONE AND ALL); THEY ARE SO SERIOUS ON THIS POINT, SO PASSIONATE ABOUT IT IN WORD AND GESTURE, THAT THE FAITH1 THAT THEY ARE OPPONENTS OF THIS IDEAL SEEMS TO BE THE LAST REMNANT OF FAITH THEY HAVE LEFT‚ÄÎBUT DOES THIS MEAN THAT THEIR FAITH IS TRUE?

WE ‚ÄÚMEN OF KNOWLEDGE‚ÄÙ HAVE GRADUALLY COME TO MISTRUST BELIEVERS OF ALL KINDS; OUR MISTRUST HAS GRADUALLY BROUGHT US TO MAKE INFERENCES THE REVERSE OF THOSE OF FORMER DAYS: WHEREVER THE STRENGTH OF A FAITH IS VERY PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED, WE INFER A CERTAIN WEAKNESS OF DEMONSTRABILITY, EVEN THE IMPROBABILITY OF WHAT IS BELIEVED. WE, TOO, DO NOT DENY THAT FAITH ‚ÄÚMAKES BLESSED‚ÄÙ: THAT IS PRECISELY WHY WE DENY THAT FAITH PROVES ANYTHING‚ÄÎA STRONG FAITH THAT MAKES BLESSED RAISES SUSPICION AGAINST THAT WHICH IS BELIEVED; IT DOES NOT ESTABLISH ‚ÄÚTRUTH,‚ÄÙ IT ESTABLISHES A CERTAIN PROBABILITY‚ÄÎOF DECEPTION. WHAT IS THE SITUATION IN THE PRESENT CASE?

THESE NAY-SAYERS AND OUTSIDERS OF TODAY WHO ARE UNCONDITIONAL ON ONE POINT2‚ÄÎTHEIR INSISTENCE ON INTELLECTUAL CLEANLINESS; THESE HARD, SEVERE, ABSTINENT, HEROIC SPIRITS WHO CONSTITUTE THE HONOR OF OUR AGE; ALL THESE PALE ATHEISTS, ANTI-CHRISTIANS,3 IMMORALISTS, NIHILISTS; THESE SKEPTICS, EPHECTICS,4 HECTICS OF THE SPIRIT (THEY ARE ALL HECTICS IN SOME SENSE OR OTHER); THESE LAST IDEALISTS OF KNOWLEDGE IN WHOM ALONE THE INTELLECTUAL CONSCIENCE DWELLS AND IS INCARNATE TODAY5‚ÄÎTHEY CERTAINLY BELIEVE THEY ARE AS COMPLETELY LIBERATED FROM THE ASCETIC IDEAL AS POSSIBLE, THESE ‚ÄÚFREE, VERY FREE SPIRITS;‚ÄÙ AND YET, TO DISCLOSE TO THEM WHAT THEY THEMSELVES CANNOT SEE‚ÄÎFOR THEY ARE TOO CLOSE TO THEMSELVES: THIS IDEAL IS PRECISELY THEIR IDEAL, TOO; THEY THEMSELVES EMBODY IT TODAY AND PERHAPS THEY ALONE; THEY THEMSELVES ARE ITS MOST SPIRITUALIZED PRODUCT, ITS MOST ADVANCED FRONT-LINE TROOPS AND SCOUTS, ITS MOST CAPTIOUS, TENDER, INTANGIBLE FORM OF SEDUCTION‚ÄÎIF I HAVE GUESSED ANY RIDDLES, I WISH THAT THIS PROPOSITION MIGHT SHOW IT!‚ÄÎTHEY ARE FAR FROM BEING FREE SPIRITS: FOR THEY STILL HAVE FAITH IN TRUTH.

WHEN THE CHRISTIAN CRUSADERS IN THE ORIENT ENCOUNTERED THE INVINCIBLE ORDER OF ASSASSINS,6 THAT ORDER OF FREE SPIRITS PAR EXCELLENCE, WHOSE LOWEST RANKS FOLLOWED A RULE OF OBEDIENCE THE LIKE OF WHICH NO ORDER OF MONKS EVER ATTAINED, THEY OBTAINED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER A HINT CONCERNING THAT SYMBOL AND WATCHWORD RESERVED FOR THE HIGHEST RANKS ALONE AS THEIR SECRETUM: ‚ÄÚNOTHING IS TRUE, EVERYTHING IS PERMITTED.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎVERY WELL, THAT WAS FREEDOM OF SPIRIT; IN THAT WAY THE FAITH IN TRUTH ITSELF WAS ABROGATED.7

HAS ANY EUROPEAN, ANY CHRISTIAN FREE SPIRIT EVER STRAYED INTO THIS PROPOSITION AND INTO ITS LABYRINTHINE CONSEQUENCES? HAS ONE OF THEM EVER KNOWN THE MINOTAUR OF THIS CAVE FROM EXPERIENCE?‚ÄÎI DOUBT IT;8 MORE, I KNOW BETTER: NOTHING IS MORE FOREIGN TO THESE MEN WHO ARE UNCONDITIONAL ABOUT ONE THING, THESE SO-CALLED ‚ÄÚFREE SPIRITS,‚ÄÙ THAN FREEDOM AND LIBERATION IN THIS SENSE; IN NO RESPECT ARE THEY MORE RIGIDLY BOUND;9 IT IS PRECISELY IN THEIR FAITH IN TRUTH THAT THEY ARE MORE RIGID AND UNCONDITIONAL THAN ANYONE. I KNOW ALL THIS FROM TOO CLOSE UP PERHAPS:10 THAT VENERABLE PHILOSOPHER‚ÄÔS ABSTINENCE TO WHICH SUCH A FAITH COMMITS ONE; THAT INTELLECTUAL STOICISM WHICH ULTIMATELY REFUSES NOT ONLY TO AFFIRM BUT ALSO TO DENY; THAT DESIRE TO HALT BEFORE THE FACTUAL, THE FACTUM BRUTUM; THAT FATALISM OF ‚ÄÚPETITS FAITS‚ÄÙ (CE PETIT FAITALISME,11 AS I CALL IT) THROUGH WHICH FRENCH SCHOLARSHIP NOWADAYS TRIES TO ESTABLISH A SORT OF MORAL SUPERIORITY OVER GERMAN SCHOLARSHIP; THAT GENERAL RENUNCIATION OF ALL INTERPRETATION (OF FORCING, ADJUSTING, ABBREVIATING, OMITTING, PADDING, INVENTING, FALSIFYING, AND WHATEVER ELSE IS OF THE ESSENCE OF INTERPRETING)‚ÄÎALL THIS EXPRESSES, BROADLY SPEAKING, AS MUCH ASCETIC VIRTUE AS ANY DENIAL OF SENSUALITY (IT IS AT BOTTOM ONLY A PARTICULAR MODE OF THIS DENIAL). THAT WHICH CONSTRAINS THESE MEN, HOWEVER, THIS UNCONDITIONAL WILL TO TRUTH, IS FAITH IN THE ASCETIC IDEAL ITSELF, EVEN IF AS AN UNCONSCIOUS IMPERATIVE‚ÄÎDON‚ÄÔT BE DECEIVED ABOUT THAT‚ÄÎIT IS THE FAITH IN A METAPHYSICAL VALUE, THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF TRUTH, SANCTIONED AND GUARANTEED BY THIS IDEAL ALONE (IT STANDS OR FALLS WITH THIS IDEAL).

STRICTLY SPEAKING, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS SCIENCE ‚ÄÚWITHOUT ANY PRESUPPOSITIONS;‚ÄÙ THIS THOUGHT DOES NOT BEAR THINKING THROUGH, IT IS PARALOGICAL: A PHILOSOPHY, A ‚ÄÚFAITH,‚ÄÙ MUST ALWAYS BE THERE FIRST OF ALL, SO THAT SCIENCE CAN ACQUIRE FROM IT A DIRECTION, A MEANING, A LIMIT, A METHOD, A RIGHT TO EXIST. (WHOEVER HAS THE OPPOSITE NOTION, WHOEVER TRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, TO PLACE PHILOSOPHY ‚ÄÚON A STRICTLY SCIENTIFIC BASIS,‚ÄÙ FIRST NEEDS TO STAND NOT ONLY PHILOSOPHY BUT TRUTH ITSELF ON ITS HEAD‚ÄÎTHE GROSSEST VIOLATION OF DECENCY POSSIBLE IN RELATION TO TWO SUCH VENERABLE FEMALES!) THERE IS NO DOUBT OF IT‚ÄÎAND HERE I CITE THE FIFTH BOOK OF MY GAY SCIENCE (SECTION 34412):

‚ÄÚTHE TRUTHFUL MAN, IN THE AUDACIOUS AND ULTIMATE SENSE PRESUPPOSED BY THE FAITH IN SCIENCE, THEREBY AFFIRMS ANOTHER WORLD THAN THAT OF LIFE, NATURE, AND HISTORY; AND INSOFAR AS HE AFFIRMS THIS ‚ÄÒOTHER WORLD,‚ÄÔ DOES THIS NOT MEAN THAT HE HAS TO DENY ITS ANTITHESIS, THIS WORLD, OUR WORLD? ‚Ä¶ IT IS STILL A METAPHYSICAL FAITH THAT UNDERLIES OUR FAITH IN SCIENCE‚ÄÎAND WE MEN OF KNOWLEDGE OF TODAY, WE GODLESS MEN AND ANTI-METAPHYSICIANS, WE, TOO, STILL DERIVE OUR FLAME FROM THE FIRE IGNITED BY A FAITH MILLENNIA OLD, THE CHRISTIAN FAITH, WHICH WAS ALSO PLATO‚ÄÔS, THAT GOD IS TRUTH, THAT TRUTH IS DIVINE.‚ÄÎBUT WHAT IF THIS BELIEF IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE UNBELIEVABLE, IF NOTHING TURNS OUT TO BE DIVINE ANY LONGER UNLESS IT BE ERROR, BLINDNESS, LIES‚ÄÎIF GOD HIMSELF TURNS OUT TO BE OUR LONGEST LIE?‚ÄÙ

AT THIS POINT IT IS NECESSARY TO PAUSE AND TAKE CAREFUL STOCK. SCIENCE ITSELF HENCEFORTH REQUIRES JUSTIFICATION (WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT THERE IS ANY SUCH JUSTIFICATION).13 CONSIDER ON THIS QUESTION BOTH THE EARLIEST AND MOST RECENT PHILOSOPHERS: THEY ARE ALL OBLIVIOUS OF HOW MUCH THE WILL TO TRUTH ITSELF FIRST REQUIRES JUSTIFICATION; HERE THERE IS A LACUNA IN EVERY PHILOSOPHY‚ÄÎHOW DID THIS COME ABOUT? BECAUSE THE ASCETIC IDEAL HAS HITHERTO DOMINATED ALL PHILOSOPHY, BECAUSE TRUTH WAS POSITED AS BEING, AS GOD, AS THE HIGHEST COURT OF APPEAL‚ÄÎBECAUSE TRUTH WAS NOT PERMITTED TO BE A PROBLEM AT ALL. IS THIS ‚ÄÚPERMITTED‚ÄÙ UNDERSTOOD?‚ÄÎFROM THE MOMENT FAITH IN THE GOD OF THE ASCETIC IDEAL IS DENIED, A NEW PROBLEM ARISES: THAT OF THE VALUE OF TRUTH.

THE WILL TO TRUTH REQUIRES A CRITIQUE‚ÄÎLET US THUS DEFINE OUR OWN TASK‚ÄÎTHE VALUE OF TRUTH MUST FOR ONCE BE EXPERIMENTALLY CALLED INTO QUESTION.14

(WHOEVER FEELS THAT THIS HAS BEEN STATED TOO BRIEFLY SHOULD READ THE SECTION OF THE GAY SCIENCE ENTITLED ‚ÄÚTO WHAT EXTENT WE, TOO, ARE STILL PIOUS‚ÄÙ (SECTION 344), OR PREFERABLY THE ENTIRE FIFTH BOOK OF THAT WORK, AS WELL AS THE PREFACE TO THE DAWN.)

NO! DON‚ÄÔT COME TO ME WITH SCIENCE WHEN I ASK FOR THE NATURAL ANTAGONIST OF THE ASCETIC IDEAL, WHEN I DEMAND: ‚ÄÚWHERE IS THE OPPOSING WILL EXPRESSING THE OPPOSING IDEAL?‚ÄÙ SCIENCE IS NOT NEARLY SELF-RELIANT ENOUGH TO BE THAT; IT FIRST REQUIRES IN EVERY RESPECT AN IDEAL OF VALUE, A VALUE-CREATING POWER, IN THE SERVICE OF WHICH IT COULD BELIEVE IN ITSELF‚ÄÎIT NEVER CREATES VALUES. ITS RELATION TO THE ASCETIC IDEAL IS BY NO MEANS ESSENTIALLY ANTAGONISTIC; IT MIGHT EVEN BE SAID TO REPRESENT THE DRIVING FORCE IN THE LATTER‚ÄÔS INNER DEVELOPMENT. IT OPPOSES AND FIGHTS, ON CLOSER INSPECTION, NOT THE IDEAL ITSELF BUT ONLY ITS EXTERIORS, ITS GUISE AND MASQUERADE, ITS TEMPORARY DOGMATIC HARDENING AND STIFFENING, AND BY DENYING WHAT IS EXOTERIC IN THIS IDEAL, IT LIBERATES WHAT LIFE IS IN IT. THIS PAIR, SCIENCE AND THE ASCETIC IDEAL, BOTH REST ON THE SAME FOUNDATION‚ÄÎI HAVE ALREADY INDICATED IT: ON THE SAME OVERESTIMATION OF TRUTH (MORE EXACTLY: ON THE SAME BELIEF THAT TRUTH IS INESTIMABLE AND CANNOT BE CRITICIZED). THEREFORE THEY ARE NECESSARILY ALLIES, SO THAT IF THEY ARE TO BE FOUGHT THEY CAN ONLY BE FOUGHT AND CALLED IN QUESTION TOGETHER. A DEPRECIATION OF THE ASCETIC IDEAL UNAVOIDABLY INVOLVES A DEPRECIATION‚ÄÔ OF SCIENCE: ONE MUST KEEP ONE‚ÄÔS EYES AND EARS OPEN TO THIS FACT!

(ART‚ÄÎTO SAY IT IN ADVANCE, FOR I SHALL SOME DAY RETURN TO THIS SUBJECT AT GREATER LENGTH‚ÄÎART, IN WHICH PRECISELY THE LIE IS SANCTIFIED AND THE WILL TO DECEPTION HAS A GOOD CONSCIENCE, IS MUCH MORE FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED TO THE ASCETIC IDEAL THAN IS SCIENCE: THIS WAS INSTINCTIVELY SENSED BY PLATO, THE GREATEST ENEMY OF ART EUROPE HAS YET PRODUCED. PLATO VERSUS HOMER: THAT IS THE COMPLETE, THE GENUINE ANTAGONISM‚ÄÎTHERE THE SINCEREST ADVOCATE OF THE ‚ÄÚBEYOND,‚ÄÙ THE GREAT SLANDERER OF LIFE; HERE THE INSTINCTIVE DEIFIER, THE GOLDEN NATURE.1 TO PLACE HIMSELF IN THE SERVICE OF THE ASCETIC IDEAL IS THEREFORE THE MOST DISTINCTIVE CORRUPTION OF AN ARTIST THAT IS AT ALL POSSIBLE; UNHAPPILY, ALSO ONE OF THE MOST COMMON FORMS OF CORRUPTION, FOR NOTHING IS MORE EASILY CORRUPTED THAN AN ARTIST.)

PHYSIOLOGICALLY, TOO, SCIENCE RESTS ON THE SAME FOUNDATION AS THE ASCETIC IDEAL: A CERTAIN IMPOVERISHMENT OF LIFE IS A PRESUPPOSITION OF BOTH OF THEM‚ÄÎTHE AFFECTS GROWN COOL, THE TEMPO OF LIFE SLOWED DOWN, DIALECTICS IN PLACE OF INSTINCT, SERIOUSNESS IMPRINTED ON FACES AND GESTURES (SERIOUSNESS, THE MOST UNMISTAKABLE SIGN OF A LABORED METABOLISM, OF STRUGGLING, LABORIOUS LIFE). OBSERVE THE AGES IN THE HISTORY OF PEOPLE WHEN THE SCHOLAR STEPS INTO THE FOREGROUND: THEY ARE AGES OF EXHAUSTION, OFTEN OF EVENING AND DECLINE; OVERFLOWING ENERGY, CERTAINTY OF LIFE AND OF THE FUTURE, ARE THINGS OF THE PAST. A PREDOMINANCE OF MANDARINS ALWAYS MEANS SOMETHING IS WRONG; SO DO THE ADVENT OF DEMOCRACY, INTERNATIONAL COURTS IN PLACE OF WAR, EQUAL RIGHTS FOR WOMEN, THE RELIGION OF PITY, AND WHATEVER OTHER SYMPTOMS OF DECLINING LIFE THERE ARE. (SCIENCE POSED AS A PROBLEM; WHAT IS THE MEANING OF SCIENCE?‚ÄÎCF. THE PREFACE2 TO THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY.)

NO! THIS ‚ÄÚMODERN SCIENCE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎLET US FACE THIS FACT!‚ÄÎIS THE BEST ALLY THE ASCETIC IDEAL HAS AT PRESENT, AND PRECISELY BECAUSE IT IS THE MOST UNCONSCIOUS, INVOLUNTARY, HIDDEN, AND SUBTERRANEAN ALLY! THEY HAVE PLAYED THE SAME GAME UP TO NOW, THE ‚ÄÚPOOR IN SPIRIT‚ÄÙ AND THE SCIENTIFIC OPPONENTS OF THIS IDEAL (ONE SHOULD NOT THINK, BY THE WAY, THAT THEY ARE THEIR OPPOSITES, THE RICH IN SPIRIT PERHAPS‚ÄÎTHEY ARE NOT; I HAVE CALLED THEM THE HECTICS3 OF THE SPIRIT). AS FOR THE FAMOUS VICTORIES OF THE LATTER, THEY UNDOUBTEDLY ARE VICTORIES‚ÄÎBUT OVER WHAT? THE ASCETIC IDEAL HAS DECIDEDLY NOT BEEN CONQUERED: IF ANYTHING, IT BECAME STRONGER, WHICH IS TO SAY, MORE ELUSIVE, MORE SPIRITUAL, MORE CAPTIOUS, AS SCIENCE REMORSELESSLY DETACHED AND BROKE OFF WALL UPON WALL, EXTERNAL ADDITIONS THAT HAD COARSENED ITS APPEARANCE. DOES ANYONE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE DEFEAT OF THEOLOGICAL ASTRONOMY REPRESENTED A DEFEAT FOR THAT IDEAL?

HAS MAN PERHAPS BECOME LESS DESIROUS OF A TRANSCENDENT SOLUTION TO THE RIDDLE OF HIS EXISTENCE, NOW THAT THIS EXISTENCE APPEARS MORE ARBITRARY, BEGGARLY, AND DISPENSABLE IN THE VISIBLE ORDER OF THINGS? HAS THE SELF-BELITTLEMENT OF MAN, HIS WILL TO SELF-BELITTLEMENT, NOT PROGRESSED IRRESISTIBLY SINCE COPERNICUS? ALAS, THE FAITH IN THE DIGNITY AND UNIQUENESS OF MAN, IN HIS IRREPLACEABILITY IN THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING,4 IS A THING OF THE PAST‚ÄÎHE HAS BECOME AN ANIMAL, LITERALLY AND WITHOUT RESERVATION OR QUALIFICATION, HE WHO WAS, ACCORDING TO HIS OLD FAITH, ALMOST GOD (‚ÄÚCHILD OF GOD,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚGOD-MAN‚ÄÙ).

SINCE COPERNICUS, MAN SEEMS TO HAVE GOT HIMSELF ON AN INCLINED PLANE‚ÄÎNOW HE IS SLIPPING FASTER AND FASTER AWAY FROM THE CENTER INTO‚ÄÎWHAT? INTO NOTHINGNESS? INTO A ‚ÄÚPENETRATING SENSE OF HIS NOTHINGNESS‚ÄÙ?5 VERY WELL! HASN‚ÄÔT THIS BEEN THE STRAIGHTEST ROUTE TO‚ÄÎTHE OLD IDEAL?

ALL SCIENCE (AND BY NO MEANS ONLY ASTRONOMY, ON THE HUMILIATING AND DEGRADING EFFECT OF WHICH KANT MADE THE NOTEWORTHY CONFESSION: ‚ÄÚIT DESTROYS MY IMPORTANCE‚ÄÙ ‚Ä¶), ALL SCIENCE, NATURAL AS WELL AS UNNATURAL‚ÄÎWHICH IS WHAT I CALL THE SELF-CRITIQUE OF KNOWLEDGE‚ÄÎHAS AT PRESENT THE OBJECT OF DISSUADING MAN FROM HIS FORMER RESPECT FOR HIMSELF, AS IF THIS HAD BEEN NOTHING BUT A PIECE OF BIZARRE CONCEIT. ONE MIGHT EVEN SAY THAT ITS OWN PRIDE, ITS OWN AUSTERE FORM OF STOICAL ATARAXY, CONSISTS IN SUSTAINING THIS HARD-WON SELF-CONTEMPT OF MAN AS HIS ULTIMATE AND MOST SERIOUS CLAIM TO SELF-RESPECT (AND QUITE RIGHTLY, INDEED: FOR HE THAT DESPISES IS ALWAYS ONE WHO ‚ÄÚHAS NOT FORGOTTEN HOW TO RESPECT‚ÄÙ ‚Ä¶) IS THIS REALLY TO WORK AGAINST THE ASCETIC IDEAL? DOES ONE STILL SERIOUSLY BELIEVE (AS THEOLOGIANS IMAGINED FOR A WHILE) THAT KANT‚ÄÔS VICTORY OVER THE DOGMATIC CONCEPTS OF THEOLOGY (‚ÄÚGOD,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚSOUL,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚFREEDOM,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚIMMORTALITY‚ÄÙ) DAMAGED THAT IDEAL?‚ÄÎIT BEING NO CONCERN OF OURS FOR THE PRESENT WHETHER KANT EVER HAD ANY INTENTION OF DOING SUCH A THING. WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT, SINCE KANT, TRANSCENDENTALISTS OF EVERY KIND HAVE ONCE MORE WON THE DAY‚ÄÎTHEY HAVE BEEN EMANCIPATED FROM THE THEOLOGIANS: WHAT JOY!‚ÄÎKANT SHOWED THEM A SECRET PATH BY WHICH THEY MAY, ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE AND WITH ALL SCIENTIFIC RESPECTABILITY, FROM NOW ON FOLLOW THEIR ‚ÄÚHEART‚ÄÔS DESIRE.‚ÄÙ

IN THE SAME VEIN: WHO COULD HOLD IT AGAINST THE AGNOSTICS IF, AS VOTARIES OF THE UNKNOWN AND MYSTERIOUS AS SUCH, THEY NOW WORSHIP THE QUESTION MARK ITSELF AS GOD? (XAVER DOUDAN6 ONCE SPOKE OF THE RAVAGES WORKED BY ‚ÄÚL‚ÄÔHABITUDE D‚ÄÔADMIRER L‚ÄÔININTELLIGIBLE AU LIEU DE RESTER TOUT SIMPLEMENT DANS L‚ÄÔINCONNU‚ÄÙ;7 HE THOUGHT THE ANCIENTS HAD AVOIDED THIS.) PRESUMING THAT EVERYTHING MAN ‚ÄÚKNOWS‚ÄÙ DOES NOT MERELY FAIL TO SATISFY HIS DESIRES BUT RATHER CONTRADICTS THEM AND PRODUCES A SENSE OF HORROR, WHAT A DIVINE WAY OUT TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEEK THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS NOT IN ‚ÄÚDESIRE‚ÄÙ BUT IN ‚ÄÚKNOWLEDGE‚ÄÙ!

‚ÄÚTHERE IS NO KNOWLEDGE: CONSEQUENTLY‚ÄÎTHERE IS A GOD‚ÄÙ: WHAT A NEW ELEGANTIA SYLLOGISMI!8 WHAT A TRIUMPH FOR THE ASCETIC IDEAL!‚ÄÎ





26


OR DOES MODERN HISTORIOGRAPHY PERHAPS DISPLAY AN ATTITUDE MORE ASSURED OF LIFE AND IDEALS? ITS NOBLEST CLAIM NOWADAYS IS THAT IT IS A MIRROR; IT REJECTS ALL TELEOLOGY; IT NO LONGER WISHES TO ‚ÄÚPROVE‚ÄÙ ANYTHING; IT DISDAINS TO PLAY THE JUDGE AND CONSIDERS THIS A SIGN OF GOOD TASTE‚ÄÎIT AFFIRMS AS LITTLE AS IT DENIES; IT ASCERTAINS, IT ‚ÄÚDESCRIBES‚ÄÙ ‚Ä¶ ALL THIS IS TO A HIGH DEGREE ASCETIC; BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS TO AN EVEN HIGHER DEGREE NIHILISTIC, LET US NOT DECEIVE OURSELVES ABOUT THAT! ONE OBSERVES A SAD, STERN, BUT RESOLUTE GLANCE‚ÄÎAN EYE THAT LOOKS FAR, THE WAY A LONELY ARCTIC EXPLORER LOOKS FAR (SO AS NOT TO LOOK WITHIN, PERHAPS? SO AS NOT TO LOOK BACK? ‚Ä¶) HERE IS SNOW; HERE LIFE HAS GROWN SILENT; THE LAST CROWS WHOSE CRIES ARE AUDIBLE HERE ARE CALLED ‚ÄÚWHEREFORE?,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚIN VAIN!,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚNADA!‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHERE NOTHING WILL GROW OR PROSPER ANY LONGER, OR AT THE MOST PETERSBURG METAPOLITICS AND TOLSTOIAN ‚ÄÚPITY.‚ÄÙ

AS FOR THAT OTHER TYPE OF HISTORIAN, AN EVEN MORE ‚ÄÚMODERN‚ÄÙ TYPE PERHAPS, A HEDONIST AND VOLUPTUARY WHO FLIRTS BOTH WITH LIFE AND WITH THE ASCETIC IDEAL, WHO EMPLOYS THE WORD ‚ÄÚARTIST‚ÄÙ AS A GLOVE AND HAS TODAY TAKEN SOLE LEASE OF THE PRAISE OF CONTEMPLATION: OH HOW THESE SWEETISH AND CLEVER FELLOWS MAKE ONE LONG EVEN FOR ASCETICS AND WINTER LANDSCAPES! NO! THE DEVIL TAKE THIS TYPE OF ‚ÄÚCONTEMPLATIVE‚ÄÙ! I WOULD EVEN PREFER TO WANDER THROUGH THE GLOOMY, GRAY, COLD FOG WITH THOSE HISTORICAL NIHILISTS! INDEED, IF I HAD TO CHOOSE I MIGHT EVEN OPT FOR SOME COMPLETELY UNHISTORICAL, ANTI-HISTORICAL PERSON (SUCH AS D√ºHRING, WHOSE VOICE TODAY INTOXICATES IN GERMANY A HITHERTO SHY AND UNAVOWED SPECIES OF ‚ÄÚBEAUTIFUL SOUL,‚ÄÙ THE SPECIES ANARCHISTICA WITHIN THE EDUCATED PROLETARIAT).

THE ‚ÄÚCONTEMPLATIVES‚ÄÙ ARE A HUNDRED TIMES WORSE: I KNOW OF NOTHING THAT EXCITES SUCH DISGUST AS THIS KIND OF ‚ÄÚOBJECTIVE‚ÄÙ ARMCHAIR SCHOLAR, THIS KIND OF SCENTED VOLUPTUARY OF HISTORY, HALF PARSON, HALF SATYR, PERFUME BY RENAN,1 WHO BETRAYS IMMEDIATELY WITH THE HIGH FALSETTO OF HIS APPLAUSE WHAT HE LACKS, WHERE HE LACKS IT, WHERE IN THIS CASE THE FATES HAVE APPLIED THEIR CRUEL SHEARS WITH, ALAS, SUCH SURGICAL SKILL! THIS OFFENDS MY TASTE; ALSO MY PATIENCE, LET HIM HAVE PATIENCE WITH SUCH SIGHTS WHO HAS NOTHING TO LOSE BY THEM‚ÄÎSUCH A SIGHT AROUSES MY IRE, SUCH ‚ÄÚSPECTATORS‚ÄÙ DISPOSE ME AGAINST THE ‚ÄÚSPECTACLE‚ÄÙ MORE THAN THE SPECTACLE ITSELF (THE SPECTACLE OF HISTORY, YOU UNDERSTAND); I FALL UNAWARES INTO AN ANACREONTIC MOOD. NATURE, WHICH GAVE THE BULL HIS HORNS AND THE LION HIS CHASM‚ÄÔ ODONT≈ÇN,2 WHY DID NATURE GIVE ME MY FOOT? ‚Ä¶ TO KICK, HOLY ANACREON! AND NOT ONLY FOR RUNNING AWAY; FOR KICKING TO PIECES THESE ROTTEN ARMCHAIRS, THIS COWARDLY CONTEMPLATIVENESS, THIS LASCIVIOUS HISTORICAL EUNUCHISM, THIS FLIRTING WITH ASCETIC IDEALS, THIS JUSTICE-TARTUFFERY OF IMPOTENCE!

ALL HONOR TO THE ASCETIC IDEAL INSOFAR AS IT IS HONEST! SO LONG AS IT BELIEVES IN ITSELF AND DOES NOT PLAY TRICKS ON US! BUT I DO NOT LIKE ALL THESE COQUETTISH BEDBUGS WITH THEIR INSATIABLE AMBITION TO SMELL OUT THE INFINITE, UNTIL AT LAST THE INFINITE SMELLS OF BEDBUGS; I DO NOT LIKE THESE WHITED SEPULCHERS WHO IMPERSONATE LIFE; I DO NOT LIKE THESE WEARY AND PLAYED-OUT PEOPLE WHO WRAP THEMSELVES IN WISDOM AND LOOK ‚ÄÚOBJECTIVE;‚ÄÙ I DO NOT LIKE THESE AGITATORS DRESSED UP AS HEROES WHO WEAR THE MAGIC CAP OF IDEALS ON THEIR STRAW HEADS; I DO NOT LIKE THESE AMBITIOUS ARTISTS WHO LIKE TO POSE AS ASCETICS AND PRIESTS BUT WHO ARE AT BOTTOM ONLY TRAGIC BUFFOONS; AND I ALSO DO NOT LIKE THESE LATEST SPECULATORS IN IDEALISM, THE ANTI-SEMITES, WHO TODAY ROLL THEIR EYES IN A CHRISTIAN-ARYAN-BOURGEOIS MANNER AND EXHAUST ONE‚ÄÔS PATIENCE BY TRYING TO ROUSE UP ALL THE HORNED-BEAST ELEMENTS IN THE PEOPLE BY A BRAZEN ABUSE OF THE CHEAPEST OF ALL AGITATOR‚ÄÔS TRICKS, MORAL ATTITUDINIZING (THAT NO KIND OF SWINDLE FAILS TO SUCCEED IN GERMANY TODAY IS CONNECTED WITH THE UNDENIABLE AND PALPABLE STAGNATION OF THE GERMAN SPIRIT; AND THE CAUSE OF THAT I SEEK IN A TOO EXCLUSIVE DIET OF NEWSPAPERS, POLITICS, BEER, AND WAGNERIAN MUSIC, TOGETHER WITH THE PRESUPPOSITIONS OF SUCH A DIET: FIRST, NATIONAL CONSTRICTION AND VANITY, THE STRONG BUT NARROW PRINCIPLE ‚ÄÚDEUTSCHLAND, DEUTSCHLAND √ºBER ALLES‚ÄÙ AND THEN THE PARALYSIS AGITANA3 OF ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS‚ÄÙ).

EUROPE IS RICH AND INVENTIVE TODAY ABOVE ALL IN MEANS OF EXCITATION; IT SEEMS TO NEED NOTHING AS MUCH AS IT NEEDS STIMULANTS AND BRANDY: HENCE ALSO THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FORGERY IN IDEALS, THIS MOST POTENT BRANDY OF THE SPIRIT; HENCE ALSO THE REPULSIVE, ILL-SMELLING, MENDACIOUS, PSEUDO-ALCOHOLIC AIR EVERYWHERE. I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY SHIPLOADS OF SHAM IDEALISM, HEROIC TRAPPINGS AND GRAND-WORD-RATTLES, HOW MANY TONS OF SUGARED SYMPATHY-SPIRITS (DISTILLERS: LA RELIGION DE LA SOUFFRANCE4), HOW MANY ‚ÄÚNOBLE-INDIGNATION‚ÄÙ STILTS FOR THE AID OF THE SPIRITUALLY FLATFOOTED, HOW MANY COMEDIANS OF THE CHRISTIAN-MORAL IDEAL WOULD HAVE TO BE EXPORTED FROM EUROPE TODAY BEFORE ITS AIR WOULD BEGIN TO SMELL FRESH AGAIN.

WITH THIS OVERPRODUCTION THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A NEW OPENING FOR TRADE HERE; THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A ‚ÄÚBUSINESS‚ÄÙ TO BE MADE OUT OF LITTLE IDEAL-IDOLS AND THE ‚ÄÚIDEALISTS‚ÄÙ WHO GO WITH THEM: DON‚ÄÔT LET THIS OPPORTUNITY SLIP! WHO HAS THE COURAGE FOR IT?‚ÄÎWE HAVE IN OUR HANDS THE MEANS TO ‚ÄÚIDEALIZE‚ÄÙ THE WHOLE EARTH!

BUT WHY AM I SPEAKING OF COURAGE: ONLY ONE THING IS NEEDED HERE, THE HAND, AN UNINHIBITED, A VERY UNINHIBITED HAND.‚ÄÎ

ENOUGH! ENOUGH! LET US LEAVE THESE CURIOSITIES AND COMPLEXITIES OF THE MOST MODERN SPIRIT, WHICH PROVOKE AS MUCH LAUGHTER AS CHAGRIN: OUR PROBLEM, THE PROBLEM OF THE MEANING OF THE ASCETIC IDEAL, CAN DISPENSE WITH THEM: WHAT HAS THIS PROBLEM TO DO WITH YESTERDAY OR TODAY! I SHALL PROBE THESE THINGS MORE THOROUGHLY AND SEVERELY IN ANOTHER CONNECTION (UNDER THE TITLE ‚ÄÚON THE HISTORY OF EUROPEAN NIHILISM;‚ÄÙ IT WILL BE CONTAINED IN A WORK IN PROGRESS: THE WILL TO POWER: ATTEMPT AT A REVALUATION OF ALL VALUES1). ALL I HAVE BEEN CONCERNED TO INDICATE HERE IS THIS: IN THE MOST SPIRITUAL SPHERE, TOO, THE ASCETIC IDEAL HAS AT PRESENT ONLY ONE KIND OF REAL ENEMY CAPABLE OF HARMING IT: THE COMEDIANS OF THIS IDEAL‚ÄÎFOR THEY AROUSE MISTRUST OF IT. EVERYWHERE ELSE THAT THE SPIRIT IS STRONG, MIGHTY, AND AT WORK WITHOUT COUNTERFEIT TODAY, IT DOES WITHOUT IDEALS OF ANY KIND‚ÄÎTHE POPULAR EXPRESSION FOR THIS ABSTINENCE IS ‚ÄÚATHEISM‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎEXCEPT FOR ITS WILL TO TRUTH. BUT THIS WILL, THIS REMNANT OF AN IDEAL, IS, IF YOU WILL BELIEVE ME, THIS IDEAL ITSELF IN ITS STRICTEST, MOST SPIRITUAL FORMULATION, ESOTERIC THROUGH AND THROUGH, WITH ALL EXTERNAL ADDITIONS ABOLISHED, AND THUS NOT SO MUCH ITS REMNANT AS ITS KERNEL. UNCONDITIONAL HONEST ATHEISM (AND ITS IS THE ONLY AIR WE BREATHE, WE MORE SPIRITUAL MEN OF THIS AGE!) IS THEREFORE NOT THE ANTITHESIS OF THAT IDEAL, AS IT APPEARS TO BE; IT IS RATHER ONLY ONE OF THE LATEST PHASES OF ITS EVOLUTION, ONE OF ITS TERMINAL FORMS AND INNER CONSEQUENCES‚ÄÎIT IS THE AWE-INSPIRING CATASTROPHE OF TWO THOUSAND YEARS OF TRAINING IN TRUTHFULNESS THAT FINALLY FORBIDS ITSELF THE LIE INVOLVED IN BELIEF IN GOD.

(THE SAME EVOLUTIONARY COURSE IN INDIA, COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT OF OURS, SHOULD PROVE SOMETHING: THE SAME IDEAL LEADS TO THE SAME CONCLUSION; THE DECISIVE POINT IS REACHED FIVE CENTURIES BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE EUROPEAN CALENDAR, WITH BUDDHA; MORE EXACTLY, WITH THE SANKHYA PHILOSOPHY, SUBSEQUENTLY POPULARIZED BY BUDDHA AND MADE INTO A RELIGION.)

WHAT, IN ALL STRICTNESS, HAS REALLY CONQUERED THE CHRISTIAN GOD? THE ANSWER MAY BE FOUND IN MY GAY SCIENCE (SECTION 357): ‚ÄÚCHRISTIAN MORALITY ITSELF, THE CONCEPT OF TRUTHFULNESS TAKEN MORE AND MORE STRICTLY, THE CONFESSIONAL SUBTLETY OF THE CHRISTIAN CONSCIENCE TRANSLATED AND SUBLIMATED INTO THE SCIENTIFIC CONSCIENCE, INTO INTELLECTUAL CLEANLINESS AT ANY PRICE. TO VIEW NATURE AS IF IT WERE A PROOF OF THE GOODNESS AND PROVIDENCE OF A GOD; TO INTERPRET HISTORY TO THE GLORY OF A DIVINE REASON, AS THE PERPETUAL WITNESS TO A MORAL WORLD ORDER AND MORAL INTENTIONS; TO INTERPRET ONE‚ÄÔS OWN EXPERIENCES, AS PIOUS MEN LONG INTERPRETED THEM, AS IF EVERYTHING WERE PREORDAINED, EVERYTHING A SIGN, EVERYTHING SENT FOR THE SALVATION OF THE SOUL‚ÄÎTHAT NOW BELONGS TO THE PAST, THAT HAS THE CONSCIENCE AGAINST IT, THAT SEEMS TO EVERY MORE SENSITIVE CONSCIENCE INDECENT, DISHONEST, MENDACIOUS, FEMINISM, WEAKNESS, COWARDICE: IT IS THIS RIGOR IF ANYTHING THAT MAKES US GOOD EUROPEANS AND THE HEIRS OF EUROPE‚ÄÔS LONGEST AND BRAVEST SELF-OVERCOMING.‚ÄÙ

ALL GREAT THINGS BRING ABOUT THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION THROUGH AN ACT OF SELF-OVERCOMING:2 THUS THE LAW OF LIFE WILL HAVE IT, THE LAW OF THE NECESSITY OF ‚ÄÚSELF-OVERCOMING‚ÄÙ IN THE NATURE OF LIFE‚ÄÎTHE LAWGIVER HIMSELF EVENTUALLY RECEIVES THE CALL: ‚ÄÚPATERE LEGEM, QUAM IPSE TULISTI.‚ÄÙ3 IN THIS WAY CHRISTIANITY AS A DOGMA WAS DESTROYED BY ITS OWN MORALITY; IN THE SAME WAY CHRISTIANITY AS MORALITY MUST NOW PERISH, TOO: WE STAND ON THE THRESHOLD OF THIS EVENT. AFTER CHRISTIAN TRUTHFULNESS HAS DRAWN ONE INFERENCE AFTER ANOTHER, IT MUST END BY DRAWING ITS MOST STRIKING INFERENCE, ITS INFERENCE AGAINST ITSELF; THIS WILL HAPPEN, HOWEVER, WHEN IT POSES THE QUESTION ‚ÄÚWHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL WILL TO TRUTH?‚ÄÙ

AND HERE I AGAIN TOUCH ON MY PROBLEM, ON OUR PROBLEM, MY UNKNOWN FRIENDS (FOR AS YET I KNOW OF NO FRIEND): WHAT MEANING WOULD OUR WHOLE BEING POSSESS IF IT WERE NOT THIS, THAT IN US THE WILL TO TRUTH BECOMES CONSCIOUS OF ITSELF AS A PROBLEM?

AS THE WILL TO TRUTH THUS GAINS SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS‚ÄÎTHERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF THAT‚ÄÎMORALITY WILL GRADUALLY PERISH NOW: THIS IS THE GREAT SPECTACLE IN A HUNDRED ACTS RESERVED FOR THE NEXT TWO CENTURIES IN EUROPE‚ÄÎTHE MOST TERRIBLE, MOST QUESTIONABLE, AND PERHAPS ALSO THE MOST HOPEFUL OF ALL SPECTACLES.‚ÄÎ

APART FROM THE ASCETIC IDEAL, MAN, THE HUMAN ANIMAL, HAD NO MEANING SO FAR. HIS EXISTENCE ON EARTH CONTAINED NO GOAL; ‚ÄÚWHY MAN AT ALL?‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWAS A QUESTION WITHOUT AN ANSWER; THE WILL FOR MAN AND EARTH WAS LACKING; BEHIND EVERY GREAT HUMAN DESTINY THERE SOUNDED AS A REFRAIN A YET GREATER ‚ÄÚIN VAIN!‚ÄÙ THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT THE ASCETIC IDEAL MEANS: THAT SOMETHING WAS LACKING, THAT MAN WAS SURROUNDED BY A FEARFUL VOID‚ÄÎHE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO JUSTIFY, TO ACCOUNT FOR, TO AFFIRM HIMSELF; HE SUFFERED FROM THE PROBLEM OF HIS MEANING. HE ALSO SUFFERED OTHERWISE, HE WAS IN THE MAIN A SICKLY ANIMAL: BUT HIS PROBLEM WAS NOT SUFFERING ITSELF, BUT THAT THERE WAS NO ANSWER TO THE CRYING QUESTION, ‚ÄÚWHY DO I SUFFER?‚ÄÙ

MAN, THE BRAVEST OF ANIMALS AND THE ONE MOST ACCUSTOMED TO SUFFERING, DOES NOT REPUDIATE SUFFERING AS SUCH; HE DESIRES IT, HE EVEN SEEKS IT OUT, PROVIDED HE IS SHOWN A MEANING FOR IT, A PURPOSE OF SUFFERING. THE MEANINGLESSNESS OF SUFFERING, NOT SUFFERING ITSELF, WAS THE CURSE THAT LAY OVER MANKIND SO FAR‚ÄÎAND THE ASCETIC IDEAL OFFERED MAN MEANING! IT WAS THE ONLY MEANING OFFERED SO FAR; ANY MEANING IS BETTER THAN NONE AT ALL; THE ASCETIC IDEAL WAS IN EVERY SENSE THE ‚ÄÚFAUTE DE MIEUX‚ÄÙ PAR EXCELLENCE SO FAR. IN IT, SUFFERING WAS INTERPRETED; THE TREMENDOUS VOID SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN FILLED; THE DOOR WAS CLOSED TO ANY KIND OF SUICIDAL NIHILISM. THIS INTERPRETATION‚ÄÎTHERE IS NO DOUBT OF IT‚ÄÎBROUGHT FRESH SUFFERING WITH IT, DEEPER, MORE INWARD, MORE POISONOUS, MORE LIFE-DESTRUCTIVE SUFFERING: IT PLACED ALL SUFFERING UNDER THE PERSPECTIVE OF GUILT.

BUT ALL THIS NOTWITHSTANDING‚ÄÎMAN WAS SAVED THEREBY, HE POSSESSED A MEANING, HE WAS HENCEFORTH NO LONGER LIKE A LEAF IN THE WIND, A PLAYTHING OF NONSENSE‚ÄÎTHE ‚ÄÚSENSE-LESS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHE COULD NOW WILL SOMETHING; NO MATTER AT FIRST TO WHAT END, WHY, WITH WHAT HE WILLED: THE WILL ITSELF WAS SAVED.

WE CAN NO LONGER CONCEAL FROM OURSELVES WHAT IS EXPRESSED BY ALL THAT WILLING WHICH HAS TAKEN ITS DIRECTION FROM THE ASCETIC IDEAL: THIS HATRED OF THE HUMAN, AND EVEN MORE OF THE ANIMAL, AND MORE STILL OF THE MATERIAL, THIS HORROR OF THE SENSES, OF REASON ITSELF, THIS FEAR OF HAPPINESS AND BEAUTY, THIS LONGING TO GET AWAY FROM ALL APPEARANCE, CHANGE, BECOMING, DEATH, WISHING, FROM LONGING ITSELF‚ÄÎALL THIS MEANS‚ÄÎLET US DARE TO GRASP IT‚ÄÎA WILL TO NOTHINGNESS, AN AVERSION1 TO LIFE, A REBELLION AGAINST THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL PRESUPPOSITIONS OF LIFE; BUT IT IS AND REMAINS A WILL! ‚Ä¶ AND, TO REPEAT IN CONCLUSION WHAT I SAID AT THE BEGINNING: MAN WOULD RATHER WILL NOTHINGNESS THAN NOT WILL.2‚ÄÎ

FEUERBACH‚ÄÔS BOOK, DAS WESEN DES CHRISTENTUMS (1841) WAS TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH BY GEORGE ELIOT AS THE ESSENCE OF CHRISTIANITY (1853, 2ND ED., 1881), AND IS STILL CONSIDERED A CLASSIC OF HUMANISM.

1CROSS, NUT, LIGHT. IN ONE OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS NOTEBOOKS WE FIND THIS SKETCH FOR A TITLE:

NUX ET CRUX

A PHILOSOPHY FOR GOOD TEETH

(ERICH PODACH, EIN BLICK IN NOTIZB√ºCHER NIETZSCHES, HEIDELBERG, WOLFGANG ROTHE, 1963 AND ERRATA SLIP).

1THIS PASSAGE THROWS A GREAT DEAL OF LIGHT ON NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS PERSPECTIVISM AND ON HIS STYLE AND PHILOSOPHICAL METHOD.

1DIESER VERNEINENDE‚Ä¶UND JA-SCHAFFENDE: CF. GOETHE, FAUST, LINES 1335FF., WHERE MEPHISTOPHELES CALLS HIMSELF: ‚ÄÚTHE SPIRIT THAT NEGATES [VERNEINT]‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚPART OF THAT FORCE WHICH WOULD I DO EVIL EVERMORE, AND YET CREATES THE GOOD.‚ÄÙ IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH, THE PORTRAIT OF ‚ÄÚTHE GREAT EXPERIMENTER‚ÄÙ BRINGS TO MIND GOETHE‚ÄÔS FAUST.

1MEN OF GOOD WILL.

2‚ÄÚFORTUNATE AND HAPPY‚ÄÙ: DIE GL√ºCKLICHEN. IN THE NEXT SENTENCE THE WORD IS RENDERED ‚ÄÚTHE FORTUNATE,‚ÄÙ AND GL√ºCK AS ‚ÄÚGOOD FORTUNE;‚ÄÙ BUT IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH ‚ÄÚHAPPY‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚHAPPINESS‚ÄÙ HAVE BEEN USED, AS NIETZSCHE EVIDENTLY MEANS BOTH.

3CF. GOETHE‚ÄÔS LETTER TO FRAU VON STEIN, JUNE 8, 1787: ‚ÄÚALSO, I MUST SAY MYSELF, I THINK IT TRUE THAT HUMANITY WILL TRIUMPH EVENTUALLY, ONLY I FEAR THAT AT THE SAME TIME THE WORLD WILL BECOME A LARGE HOSPITAL AND EACH WILL BECOME THE OTHER‚ÄÔS HUMANE NURSE.‚ÄÙ IN A LETTER TO R√©E, APRIL 17, 1877, NIETZSCHE WRITES, ‚ÄÚEACH THE OTHER‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÒHUMANE NURSE.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

4THE DANGERS OF THE GREAT NAUSEA AND THE GREAT PITY ARE AMONG THE CENTRAL MOTIFS OF THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA. THE THEME OF NAUSEA IS INTRODUCED IN THE CHAPTER ‚ÄÚON THE RABBLE‚ÄÙ IN PART TWO AND IS ENCOUNTERED AGAIN AND AGAIN IN LATER CHAPTERS. ANOTHER CHAPTER IN PART TWO BEARS THE TITLE ‚ÄÚON THE PITYING,‚ÄÙ AND THE WHOLE OF PART FOUR, WHICH BEARS A MOTTO FROM THAT CHAPTER, IS CAST IN THE FORM OF A STORY: HAVING OVERCOME HIS NAUSEA AT THE END OF PART THREE, ZARATHUSTRA‚ÄÔS FINAL TEMPTATION IS PITY.

1THE MOST STRIKING ILLUSTRATION OF THIS SENTENCE IS FOUND IN DOSTOEVSKY‚ÄÔS NOTES FROM UNDERGROUND‚ÄÎAND ON FEBRUARY 23, 1887, NOT QUITE NINE MONTHS BEFORE THE PUBLICATION OF THE GENEALOGY, NIETZSCHE WROTE OVERBECK ABOUT HIS ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERY OF DOSTOEVSKY IN A BOOKSTORE, WHERE HE HAD CHANCED UPON A FRENCH TRANSLATION OF THAT WORK: ‚ÄÚMY JOY WAS EXTRAORDINARY‚ÄÙ (PORTABLE NIETZSCHE.). IN 1888 HE WROTE IN SECTION 45 OF TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS: ‚ÄÚTHE TESTIMONY OF DOSTOEVSKY IS RELEVANT TO THIS PROBLEM‚ÄÎDOSTOEVSKY, THE ONLY PSYCHOLOGIST, INCIDENTALLY, FROM WHOM I HAD SOMETHING TO LEARN; HE RANKS AMONG THE MOST BEAUTIFUL STROKES OF FORTUNE IN MY LIFE, EVEN MORE THAN MY DISCOVERY OF STENDHAL‚Ä¶.‚ÄÙ (IBID.; CF. ALSO PP. 601 AND 603). SEE ALSO NOTE 8, SECTION 24, BELOW.

1SENTIMENTAL SORROW OVER THE WORLD‚ÄÔS WOES.

2NIETZSCHE USES THE ENGLISH WORD ‚ÄÚVEGETARIANS.‚ÄÙ THE REFERENCE TO JUNKER CHRISTOPH, WHO IS MENTIONED ONCE MORE LATER IN THIS SECTION, IS PRESUMABLY INTENDED TO ALLUDE TO THE TAMING OF THE SHREW. ‚ÄÚSHE EAT NO MEAT TODAY, NOR NONE SHALL EAT‚ÄÙ (IV. 2, LINE 200) IS, OF COURSE, SAID BY PETRUCHIO, AND IN THE ACCEPTED VERSION OF THE PLAY CHRISTOPHER SLY, THE DRUNKEN TINKER WHO IS MADE TO BELIEVE THAT HE IS A LORD, APPEARS ONLY IN THE ‚ÄÚINDUCTION‚ÄÙ (OR PROLOGUE) AND IN ONE SUBSEQUENT COMMENT. BUT IN THE TAMING OF A (SIC) SHREW (1594), WHICH SLIGHTLY ANTEDATES THE ACCEPTED VERSION AND IS ATTRIBUTED TO SHAKESPEARE BY A FEW SCHOLARS, THE CHARACTERS INTRODUCED IN THE INDUCTION MAKE COMMENTS FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGHOUT THE PLAY.

3THE SECOND STRATEGY IS INTRODUCED AT THE BEGINNING OF SECTION 18.

4ONE MUST MAKE ONESELF STUPID: IN THE FAMOUS PASSAGE IN THE PENS√©ES IN WHICH PASCAL‚ÄÔS WAGER IS FOUND.

1LACK OF CARE OF SELF.

2SELF-CONTEMPT. ARNOLD GEULINCX (1624‚ÄÌ1669) WAS A BELGIAN PHILOSOPHER.

1HERE AS MUCH AS ANYWHERE FREUD IS NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS GREAT HEIR WHO DID MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE TO CHANGE THE STYLE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. FREUD‚ÄÔS INSISTENCE ON USING THE TERM ‚ÄÚSEXUAL‚ÄÙ RATHER THAN ‚ÄÚEROTIC‚ÄÙ IS A CASE IN POINT; SO IS HIS STUBBORN INSISTENCE ON THE CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE OF SEXUAL FACTORS. THIS WAS INDEED INFLUENCED BY THE TIME AND PLACE IN WHICH HE LIVED, AS HIS CRITICS HAVE LONG CLAIMED‚ÄÎBUT NOT IN THE SENSE INTENDED BY THEM: RATHER, HE FOUGHT AGAINST THE SLIMY IDEALISM OF THE AGE. AND HE WAS QUICK TO SUSPECT, NOT WITHOUT REASON, THAT ERSTWHILE FOLLOWERS WHO DEVELOPED MORE INGRATIATING VARIATIONS ON HIS THEORIES WERE GUILTY OF ‚ÄÚTARTUFFERY IN DEED‚ÄÙ AND NOT MERELY IN WORDS. HE SEEMS TO HAVE FELT‚ÄÎAND THIS IS AT ANY RATE ONE OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CENTRAL MOTIFS‚ÄÎTHAT A CLEANSING OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND A RADICAL CHANGE IN TONE WERE INDISPENSABLE PRESUPPOSITIONS OF MAJOR SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES IN PSYCHOLOGY.

2THOMAS MOORE (1779‚ÄÌ1852) WAS AN IRISH POET. A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE EPISODE MENTIONED HERE MAY BE FOUND IN THE ARTICLE ON MOORE IN THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA, 11TH ED.

3WILHELM VON GWINNER (1825‚ÄÌ1917) WAS A GERMAN JURIST AND CIVIL SERVANT (STADTGERICHTSRAT IN FRANKFURT A. M., AND LATER KONSISTORIALPR√§SIDENT). AS SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS EXECUTOR, HE DID INDEED DESTROY HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL PAPERS‚ÄÎAND THEN PUBLISHED THREE BIOGRAPHICAL STUDIES OF SCHOPENHAUER: ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER AUS PERS√∂NLICHEM UMGANG DARGESTELLT (1862: ‚ÄÚA. S. AS SEEN AT FIRST HAND‚ÄÙ), SCHOPENHAUER UND SEINE FREUNDE (1863: ‚ÄÚS. AND HIS FRIENDS‚ÄÙ), AND SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS LEBEN (1878: ‚ÄÚS.‚ÄÔS LIFE‚ÄÙ).

5THE MOST SCHOLARLY EDITION OF THE LIFE OF BEETHOVEN BY ALEXANDER WHEELOCK THAYER (1817‚ÄÌ1897) IS THAT REVISED AND EDITED BY ELLIOT FORBES (2 VOLUMES, PRINCETON, N.J., PRINCETON UNIVERSITY PRESS, 1964).

1WISSENSCHAFT DOES NOT REFER ONLY, OR PRIMARILY, TO THE NATURAL SCIENCES, AND WHEN NIETZSCHE REFERS TO SCHOLARS LATER IN THIS SECTION HE IS BY NO MEANS CHANGING THE SUBJECT. IT SEEMS BEST TO CALL ATTENTION TO THIS WHILE USING ‚ÄÚSCIENCE‚ÄÙ TO TRANSLATE WISSENSCHAFT. CF. PART SIX, ‚ÄÚWE SCHOLARS‚ÄÙ (WIR GELEHRTEN, SECTIONS 204-13) IN BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL.

2BRAVES UND BESCHEIDNES ARBEITERVOLK: THE FOLLOWING REMARKS ABOUT THESE LABORERS (WHERE THE ENGLISH TEXT SPEAKS OF ‚ÄÚWORKERS‚ÄÙ THE ORIGINAL AGAIN HAS ARBEITER) SHOULD BE COMPARED WITH BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, SECTION 211.

1IN GERMAN THERE IS A SINGLE WORD FOR BELIEF AND FAITH, GLAUBE. TO BELIEVE IS GLAUBEN; UNBELIEVERS, UNGL√§UBIGE. IN THE TRANSLATION, ‚ÄÚFAITH‚ÄÙ IS CALLED FOR RATHER THAN BELIEF; FOR NIETZSCHE EMPHASIZES THE UNCONDITIONAL AND RELIGIOUS CHARACTER OF THE FAITH HE DISCUSSES.

THE IDEAS EXPRESSED HERE ARE DEVELOPED FURTHER IN THE ANTICHRIST, SECTIONS 50FF. (PORTABLE NIETZSCHE.)

SEE ALSO KAUFMANN‚ÄÔS NIETZSCHE, CHAPTER 12, SECTION III (ABOUT TEN PAGES ON ‚ÄÚFAITH VERSUS REASON‚ÄÙ). MOST OF THE RELEVANT PASSAGES, FROM THE DAWN ON, ARE CITED THERE.

2THIS UNCONDITIONAL ATTITUDE, THIS REFUSAL TO QUESTION ONE POINT, IS WHAT SEEMS OBJECTIONABLE TO NIETZSCHE.

3ANTICHRISTEN COULD ALSO MEAN ANTICHRISTS; AND WHEN NIETZSCHE, A YEAR LATER, ENTITLED ONE OF HIS LAST BOOKS DER ANTICHRIST HE PLAINLY MEANT THE ANTICHRIST: THE CONTENT OF THAT BOOK MAKES THAT CLEAR, NOR CAN THERE BE ANY DOUBT ABOUT HIS WISH AT THAT TIME TO BE AS PROVOCATIVE AS POSSIBLE. IN THE LAST SENTENCE OF SECTION 5 OF THE PREFACE, WHICH NIETZSCHE HAD ADDED TO THE NEW EDITION OF THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY IN 1886, THE YEAR BEFORE, THE GRAMMATICAL FORM NO LESS THAN THE MEANING MAKES IT CLEAR THAT ‚ÄÚTHE ANTICHRIST‚ÄÙ IS MEANT. THE ENUMERATION IN THE TEXT ABOVE RAISES THE QUESTION WHETHER THE CRITIQUE NIETZSCHE OFFERS IS NOT APPLICABLE TO HIMSELF: AFTER ALL, HE HAD ALSO CALLED HIMSELF AN IMMORALIST BOTH IN BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, SECTION 32, AND IN THE PREFACE ADDED TO THE NEW EDITION OF THE DAWN (SECTION 4); AND IN ECCE HOMO, THE FOLLOWING YEAR, HE SEVERAL TIMES CALLED HIMSELF ‚ÄÚTHE FIRST IMMORALIST.‚ÄÙ NEVERTHELESS, THE PLURAL IN THE TEXT ABOVE AND THE WHOLE ‚ÄÚFEEL‚ÄÙ OF THE PASSAGE MAKE ‚ÄÚANTI-CHRISTIANS‚ÄÙ THE MORE PLAUSIBLE READING. FOR ALL THAT, THE POINTS JUST MENTIONED COLOR THE TONE: THE MEN HE SPEAKS OF ARE PLAINLY VERY CLOSE TO HIM.

4IN SECTION 9 ABOVE, NIETZSCHE EXPLAINED THE ‚ÄÚEPHECTIC BENT‚ÄÙ: IT IS THE PROPENSITY TO SUSPEND JUDGMENT. THE PRIMARY DENOTATION OF THE NEXT WORD, ‚ÄÚHECTICS,‚ÄÙ IS CONSUMPTIVE.

5THIS, FROM NIETZSCHE, IS HIGH PRAISE INDEED. CF., E.G., THE GAY SCIENCE, SECTION 2: ‚ÄÚTHE INTELLECTUAL CONSCIENCE.‚ÄÎ‚Ä¶ BY FAR THE MOST LACK AN INTELLECTUAL CONSCIENCE.‚ÄÎ‚Ä¶ I MEAN: BY FAR THE MOST DO NOT FIND IT CONTEMPTIBLE TO BELIEVE THIS OR THAT AND TO LIVE ACCORDING TO IT, WITHOUT FIRST HAVING BECOME CONSCIOUS OF THE LAST AND SUREST REASONS PRO AND CON, AND WITHOUT EVEN TAKING THE TROUBLE TO CONSIDER SUCH REASONS AFTERWARD; THE MOST GIFTED MEN AND THE MOST NOBLE WOMEN STILL BELONG TO THESE ‚ÄÒBY FAR THE MOST‚ÄÔ YET WHAT IS GOOD-HEARTEDNESS, REFINEMENT, AND GENIUS TO ME, WHEN THE HUMAN BEING WHO HAS THESE VIRTUES TOLERATES SLACK FEELINGS IN HIS FAITH AND JUDGMENTS, AND WHEN THE DEMAND FOR CERTAINTY IS NOT TO HIM THE INMOST CRAVING AND THE DEEPEST NEED‚ÄÎTHAT WHICH DISTINGUISHES THE HIGHER FROM THE LOWER MEN‚Ä¶. NOT TO QUESTION, NOT TO TREMBLE WITH THE CRAVING AND THE JOY OF QUESTIONING ‚Ä¶ THAT IS WHAT I FEEL TO BE CONTEMPTIBLE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

NIETZSCHE NEVER RENOUNCED THESE VIEWS. SEE, E.G., ONE OF HIS VERY LAST WORKS, THE ANTICHRIST (SECTION 50; PORTABLE NIETZSCHE): ‚ÄÚAT EVERY STEP ONE HAS TO WRESTLE FOR TRUTH; ONE HAS HAD TO SURRENDER FOR IT ALMOST EVERYTHING TO WHICH THE HEART, TO WHICH OUR LOVE, OUR TRUST IN LIFE, CLING OTHERWISE. THAT REQUIRES GREATNESS OF SOUL: THE SERVICE OF TRUTH IS THE HARDEST SERVICE. WHAT DOES IT MEAN, AFTER ALL, TO HAVE INTEGRITY IN MATTERS OF THE SPIRIT? THAT ONE IS SEVERE AGAINST ONE‚ÄÔS HEART, THAT ONE DESPISES ‚ÄÒBEAUTIFUL SENTIMENTS,‚ÄÔ THAT ONE MAKES OF EVERY YES AND NO A MATTER OF CONSCIENCE. FAITH MAKES BLESSED: CONSEQUENTLY IT LIES.‚ÄÙ

NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS OBJECTION TO THOSE ‚ÄÚIN WHOM ALONE THE INTELLECTUAL CONSCIENCE DWELLS AND IS INCARNATE TODAY‚ÄÙ IS THAT THERE IS ‚ÄÚONE POINT‚ÄÙ THEY REFUSE TO QUESTION; THAT THERE IS ONE ‚ÄÚBEAUTIFUL SENTIMENT‚ÄÙ THEY STILL PERMIT THEMSELVES. AS NIETZSCHE PUTS IT A FEW LINES LATER: ‚ÄÚTHEY STILL HAVE FAITH IN TRUTH.‚ÄÙ

6AN ISLAMIC SECT, FOUNDED IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY. ‚ÄÚAS FOR THE INITIATED, THEY KNEW THE WORTHLESSNESS OF POSITIVE RELIGION AND MORALITY; THEY BELIEVED IN NOTHING ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ (ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA, 11TH ED.)

7THE STRIKING SLOGAN IS PLAINLY NEITHER NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS COINAGE NOR HIS MOTTO. IT IS A QUOTATION ON WHICH HE COMMENTS, CONTRASTING IT WITH THE UNQUESTIONING FAITH IN THE TRUTH THAT CHARACTERIZES SO MANY SO-CALLED FREE SPIRITS.

8THE ASSASSINS‚ÄÔ SLOGAN IS OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS COINAGE AND DERIVED FROM DOSTOEVSKY; E.G., BY DANTO: IT ‚ÄÚMUST SURELY BE A PARAPHRASE OF THE RUSSIAN NOVELIST HE SO ADMIRED‚ÄÙ (OP. CIT.).

IN DOSTOEVSKY‚ÄÔS BROTHERS KARAMAZOV WE ENCOUNTER THE IDEA THAT, IF MANKIND LOST THE BELIEF IN GOD AND IMMORTALITY, ‚ÄÚEVERYTHING WOULD BE PERMITTED.‚ÄÙ BUT WHAT MATTERS TO NIETZSCHE IN THIS SECTION IS THE FIRST HALF OF HIS QUOTATION, ‚ÄÚNOTHING IS TRUE,‚ÄÙ WHICH HAS NO PARALLEL IN DOSTOEVSKY. MOREOVER, THE QUOTATION FROM THE BROTHERS IS NOT PARTICULARLY PROFOUND: IT ‚ÄÚWORKS‚ÄÙ IN ITS CONTEXT IN THE NOVEL BUT EXPRESSES NO GREAT INSIGHT, TAKEN BY ITSELF.

INCIDENTALLY, NIETZSCHE NEVER READ THE BROTHERS (ORIGINALLY SERIALIZED IN RUSSIA IN 1879-80); AND THIS NOVEL WAS NOT TRANSLATED INTO FRENCH UNTIL 1888, IN A MUTILATED VERSION. ON MARCH 7, 1887, NIETZSCHE WROTE GAST THAT HE HAD READ, FIRST, L‚ÄÔESPRIT SOUTERRAIN (TRANSLATED, 1886: NOTES FROM UNDERGROUND); THEN LA MAISON DES MORTS (TR., 1886: THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD); FINALLY, HUMILI√©S ET OFFENS√©S (TR., 1884: THE INJURED AND THE INSULTED‚ÄÎTHE FIRST OF DOSTOEVSKY‚ÄÔS NOVELS TO BE TRANSLATED INTO FRENCH). ON OCTOBER 14, 1888, NIETZSCHE WROTE GAST: ‚ÄÚTHE FRENCH HAVE PRODUCED A STAGE VERSION OF DOSTOEVSKY‚ÄÔS MAIN NOVEL.‚ÄÙ THIS WAS LE CRIME ET LE CH√¢TIMENT (TR., 1884: CRIME AND PUNISHMENT). CF. F. W. J. HEMMINGS, THE RUSSIAN NOVEL IN FRANCE, 1884-1914 (NEW YORK, OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS, 1950). SEE ALSO THE NOTE ON SECTION 15 ABOVE.

FINALLY, SEE SECTION 602 OF THE WILL TO POWER, PROBABLY WRITTEN IN 1884: ‚ÄÚ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄÒEVERYTHING IS FALSE! EVERYTHING IS PERMITTED!‚ÄÔ ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

9NIETZSCHE RETURNS TO HIS OBJECTION.

10IS NIETZSCHE HERE REFERRING TO HIMSELF? WITHOUT RULING OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE ALSO HAD SOME FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE OF THE ATTITUDE HE GOES ON TO DESCRIBE‚ÄÎAT LEAST AS A POSSIBILITY‚ÄÎI FIND THE PORTRAIT VERY DIFFERENT FROM HIM. ON THE OTHER HAND, ‚ÄÚTHAT INTELLECTUAL STOICISM WHICH ULTIMATELY REFUSES NOT ONLY TO AFFIRM BUT ALSO TO DENY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND NOT ONLY THIS TRAIT‚ÄÎSEEMS AS CLOSE TO NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS BEST FRIEND, FRANZ OVERBECK (PROFESSOR OF CHURCH HISTORY AT BASEL, AND AN UNBELIEVER), AS IT SEEMS REMOTE FROM NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS OWN SPIRIT.

11THE PUN IS LESS FELICITOUS IN ENGLISH: SMALL FACTS (THE SMALL FACTALISM, AS I CALL IT).

12IN THE FOLLOWING QUOTATION, THE THREE DOTS MARK NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS OMISSION OF A FEW WORDS (ABOUT ONE LINE) FROM THE TEXT HE QUOTES. MOST OF SECTION 344 WILL BE FOUND IN THE PORTABLE NIETZSCHE. SEE ALSO KAUFMANN‚ÄÔS NIETZSCHE, CHAPTER 12, SECTION III.

13NEITHER IS IT TO SAY THAT NO JUSTIFICATION IS POSSIBLE. THE POINT IS THAT THE PROBLEM HAS TO BE CONSIDERED IN ALL SERIOUSNESS. EVEN AS IT IS NA√ØVE TO SUPPOSE THAT WE KNOW WHAT IS GOOD AND WHAT IS EVIL‚ÄÎAND IT IS NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS INTENT TO SHOW US HOW PROBLEMATIC MORALITY IS‚ÄÎIT IS ALSO NA√ØVE TO OVERLOOK THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF SCIENCE POSES A PROBLEM.

14THIS IS THE CONCLUSION TO WHICH NIETZSCHE HAS BEEN WORKING UP.

1WE RETURN TO A PROBLEM POSED IN NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS FIRST BOOK, THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY: THE RELATION OF ART AND SCIENCE. THERE IT WAS THE CONTRAST OF TRAGEDY AND SOCRATISM THAT SERVED AS A POINT OF DEPARTURE; HERE ‚ÄÚPLATO VERSUS HOMER‚ÄÙ SUMS UP THE PROBLEM. NIETZSCHE STILL FINDS SOCRATISM AND THE UNQUESTIONED FAITH IN A LIFE DEVOTED TO SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY PROBLEMATIC. BUT HE IS AS FAR AS EVER FROM CONTEMPT FOR THE LIFE OF INQUIRY: AFTER ALL, WAS NOT THIS THE LIFE HE HIMSELF CHOSE, CLINGING TO IT IN SPITE OF HIS DOCTORS‚ÄÔ ADVICE TO READ AND WRITE LESS?

HERE WE SHOULD RECALL THE SYMBOL OF THE ‚ÄÚARTISTIC SOCRATES‚ÄÙ THAT NIETZSCHE INTRODUCED NEAR THE END OF SECTION 14 OF THE BIRTH. HE CLEARLY DOES NOT CAST HIS LOT WITH EITHER PLATO OR HOMER. HE IS A PHILOSOPHER AND A POET‚ÄÎIN HIS CONCERNS MUCH MORE A PHILOSOPHER, BUT IN HIS LOVING TRANSFIGURATION OF THE LANGUAGE CLOSER TO THE POETS‚ÄÎAND HE DOES NOT DENIGRATE THIS WORLD IN FAVOR OF ANOTHER. HE WANTS TO CELEBRATE THIS WORLD, THOUGH, LIKE HOMER, HE IS ANYTHING BUT BLIND TO ITS SUFFERING. AND NOT ONLY THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY IS RELEVANT TO NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS THEME HERE; THE GAY SCIENCE IS, TOO; E.G., SECTION 327, WHICH WILL BE FOUND IN THIS VOLUME.

THE CASE OF WAGNER





TRANSLATOR‚ÄÔS INTRODUCTION


ALTHOUGH IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT NIETZSCHE AND WAGNER WERE FRIENDS FOR A WHILE AND THEN BROKE WITH EACH OTHER, THIS ESSAY HAS NOT RECEIVED THE ATTENTION IT DESERVES. IN ENGLISH IT HAS SO FAR BEEN AVAILABLE ONLY IN THE OLD EIGHTEEN-VOLUME EDITION OF THE COLLECTED WORKS. AN EARLIER VERSION, DONE FOR THE SAME COLLECTION, WAS DISCARDED.

THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO REVIEW THE RELATION OF THE TWO MEN IN DETAIL, OR TO DISCUSS AND EVALUATE THE LITERATURE ON THE SUBJECT. A RAPID SKETCH OF THE BACKGROUND OF THIS BOOK MUST SUFFICE.

WAGNER, BORN IN 1813‚ÄÎTHE SAME YEAR AS NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS FATHER, AS WELL AS VERDI AND KIERKEGAARD‚ÄÎWAS THE ONLY GREAT GENIUS WHOM NIETZSCHE EVER KNEW INTIMATELY. THE FRIENDSHIP WAS NEVER EVEN REMOTELY SYMMETRICAL: APART FROM THE DIFFERENCE IN AGE, NIETZSCHE WAS STILL A STUDENT IN NOVEMBER 1868 WHEN, AT TWENTY-FOUR, HE FIRST MET WAGNER WHO, AT FIFTY-FIVE, HAD COMPLETED THE BULK OF HIS WORK. THAT WINTER NIETZSCHE WAS APPOINTED TO A CHAIR OF CLASSICAL PHILOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BASEL, IN SWITZERLAND, WITHIN EASY REACH OF TRIBSCHEN, ALSO IN SWITZERLAND, WHERE WAGNER WAS THEN LIVING. FOR WAGNER, WHO HAD MANY DETRACTORS, IT WAS NICE TO HAVE A BRILLIANT YOUNG PROFESSOR AS AN ALLY; AND WHEN THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY APPEARED, HE WROTE NIETZSCHE: ‚ÄÚI HAVE NEVER YET READ ANYTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN YOUR BOOK.‚ÄÙ WHAT HE LIKED BEST WAS, OF COURSE, THE WORST PART OF THE BOOK, THE LENGTHY LAST PART WITH ITS EFFUSIVE APPRECIATION OF WAGNER. NOR DID HE HAVE ANYTHING BUT PRAISE FOR THOSE STYLISTIC QUALITIES WHICH NIETZSCHE HIMSELF LATER CRITICIZED IN HIS PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1886. SUCH IMITATION OF HIS OWN MANNER AND SUCH ACCEPTANCE OF HIS IMAGE OF HIMSELF AT FACE VALUE WERE THE TRIBUTE WAGNER EXACTED. INDEED, HE ASKED FOR REVISIONS IN THE ENDINGS OF THE BIRTH AND, A LITTLE LATER, OF THE THIRD ‚ÄÚUNTIMELY MEDITATION‚ÄÙ ON SCHOPENHAUER AS EDUCATOR; AND HE WAS DISPLEASED THAT IN THE SECOND ‚ÄÚMEDITATION,‚ÄÙ ON THE USE AND DISADVANTAGE OF HISTORY FOR LIFE, THERE WAS NO EXPLICIT REFERENCE TO HIM. HE HAD NO SENSE OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS DISTINCTIVE GENIUS AND MISSION: THE YOUNGER MAN WAS TO BE HIS APOSTLE‚ÄÎAND A FRIEND WHO COULD BE ASKED TO DO THE MASTER‚ÄÔS CHRISTMAS SHOPPING AND TO HELP WITH OTHER SUCH CHORES.

NO DOUBT THERE WERE MANY FACTORS THAT HELPED TO MAINTAIN THE FRIENDSHIP FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS. NOT THE LEAST OF THESE WAS A COMMON ENTHUSIASM FOR SCHOPENHAUER, WHO HAD ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN TO GAIN RECOGNITION AS A MAJOR PHILOSPHER. BUT AS FAR AS NIETZSCHE WAS CONCERNED, THE MAJOR CONSIDERATION WAS SURELY THAT, FOR ALL HIS FAULTS AND FOIBLES, WAGNER WAS A GREAT ARTIST AND INCOMPARABLY MORE FASCINATING THAN ANYBODY ELSE NIETZSCHE KNEW. TO BE CLOSE PERSONALLY TO SUCH A MAN, TO BE ABLE TO LISTEN TO HIM DISCOURSING FREELY ABOUT HIS WORK AND IDEAS, TO BELONG TO THE MASTER‚ÄÔS INNER CIRCLE‚ÄÎALL THAT WAS NOT MERELY A PRIVILEGE BUT SEEMED THE BEST THING THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED TO THE YOUNG PROFESSOR. NOT ONLY WAS HE ABLE TO TRY OUT HIS OWN IDEAS ON A MAN OF GENIUS; HE HAD FOUND A SECOND HOME. NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS FATHER HAD DIED IN 1849, BEFORE THE BOY WAS FIVE, AND HIS MOTHER‚ÄÔS NARROW PIETY AND LACK OF EDUCATION HAD MADE HIS OWN HOME QUITE DEVOID OF INTELLECTUAL STIMULATION. NIETZSCHE HAD SEVERAL GOOD FRIENDS HIS OWN AGE, AND SOME OF THESE SHARED HIS ENTHUSAISM FOR WAGNER‚ÄÎNOTABLY ERWIN ROHDE, THE CLASSICAL PHILOLOGIST, AND GUSTAV KRUG, WHO HAD TRIED TO CONVERT HIS FRIENDS TO WAGNER IN THE EARLY EIGHTEEN-SIXTIES.1

THAT WAGNER WAS DEMANDING AND IRRITABLE, AND THAT MANY OF HIS EMPHATIC OPINIONS WERE VERY DUBIOUS, WAS OBVIOUS BUT SEEMED A SMALL PRICE FOR THE BENEFITS OF SUCH A FRIENDSHIP. EVEN ERNEST NEWMAN, WHO YIELDS TO NONE IN HIS ADMIRATION AND ENTHUSIASM FOR WAGNER, WHILE HE LACKS ANY SOLID FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF NIETZSCHE AND, ON THE BASIS OF THE ‚ÄÚMASTERLY EPITOME OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS THINKING‚ÄÙ2 WRITTEN BY ONE OF THE WORST NAZI HACKS, GIVES A THOROUGHLY MISLEADING PICTURE OF NIETZSCHE, SPEAKS OF WAGNER‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚINSATIABLE LUST FOR DOMINATION,‚ÄÙ ADMITS THAT HE WANTED TO BE ‚ÄÚAN UNDISPUTED DICTATOR,‚ÄÙ3 AND DESCRIBES HOW WAGNER ‚ÄÚWORKED HIMSELF INTO A PAROXYSM OVER BISMARCK‚ÄÔS TOLERANCE TOWARDS THE JEWS.‚ÄÙ4 IN SHORT, TO COME FULLY INTO HIS OWN, NIETZSCHE HAD TO BREAK WITH WAGNER.

AS LONG AS HE LIVED AT TRIBSCHEN, A LONELY GENIUS, WAGNER‚ÄÔS IMPASSIONED FAITH IN THE SUPERIORITY OF THE GERMANS AND THE INFERIORITY OF OTHER PEOPLES, ESPECIALLY THE FRENCH AND THE JEWS, COULD PERHAPS BE DECENTLY IGNORED; BUT WHEN WAGNER CAME TO TERMS WITH THE NEW GERMAN EMPIRE AND SET UP A GREAT CULTURAL CENTER IN BAYREUTH, THE TIME FOR A CLEAR STAND WAS AT HAND‚ÄÎAND NIETZSCHE DISSOCIATED HIMSELF FROM WHAT BAYREUTH SYMBOLIZED.5 TWO FURTHER FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THE BREAK.

NIETZSCHE DID NOT TAKE CHRISTIANITY LIGHTLY. HIS FATHER, WHOSE MEMORY HE REVERED, HAD BEEN A MINISTER; SO HAD BOTH OF HIS GRANDFATHERS; AND HIS MOTHER WAS A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SCHOPENHAUER FOR NIETZSCHE AND WAGNER HAD BEEN TIED TO SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS FRANK ATHEISM. IN JANUARY 1878, WHEN WAGNER SENT NIETZSCHE HIS PARSIFAL, WITH A HUMOROUS AND FRIENDLY INSCRIPTION, THIS OPERA STRUCK NIETZSCHE AS SHAMELESS: WAGNER WAS EXPLOITING CHRISTIANITY FOR THEATRICAL EFFECT, AND THE SELF-STYLED MODERN AESCHYLUS WAS CELEBRATING THE ANTI-GREEK IDEAL OF WHAT WAGNER HIMSELF CALLED ‚ÄÚPURE FOOLISHNESS.‚ÄÙ BUT WHAT SEALED THE BREAK WAS NOT EVEN PARSIFAL, NOR NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS REACTION TO WAGNER. IT WAS RATHER NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS EMERGENCE INTO INDEPENDENCE AND WAGNER‚ÄÔS REACTION TO THAT.

IN MAY 1878 NIETZSCHE SENT WAGNER HIS OWN NEW BOOK, HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN, WITH A MOTTO FROM DESCARTES AND A DEDICATION TO VOLTAIRE. HE WAS DONE WITH SILENCE IN THE FACE OF ANTI-FRENCH OUTBURSTS. HE HAD DEVELOPED FROM SCHOPENHAUER TO VOLTAIRE, AND FROM ROMANTIC ESSAYS TO APHORISMS INFLUENCED BY FRENCH MODELS. HE REPUDIATED NATIONALISM EMPHATICALLY AND PROPOSED THE IDEAL OF THE ‚ÄÚGOOD EUROPEAN.‚ÄÙ ALL THIS WAS MUCH MORE UNFORGIVABLE IN WAGNER‚ÄÔS EYES THAN EVEN PARSIFAL HAD BEEN IN NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS, AND IN AUGUST OF THAT YEAR WAGNER ATTACKED HIS ERSTWHILE FRIEND IN THE BAYREUTHER BL√§TTER.

IN 1874, WHEN HE WAS STILL WORKING ON THE FOURTH ‚ÄÚMEDITATION,‚ÄÙ A EULOGY OF WAGNER, NIETZSCHE HAD ALSO JOTTED DOWN IN HIS NOTEBOOKS A GREAT MANY CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS. THE BIRTH HAD APPEARED IN 1872, THE FIRST ‚ÄÚMEDITATION‚ÄÙ IN 1873, THE SECOND AND THIRD BOTH IN 1874, BUT THE FOURTH GAVE NIETZSCHE A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE AND WAS NOT PUBLISHED UNTIL 1876. IN HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN (1878) WAGNER‚ÄÔS NAME DOES NOT APPEAR‚ÄÎIT IS FOUND IN THE PREFACE ADDED TO THE NEW EDITION OF 1886‚ÄÎBUT THE CHAPTER ON THE SOULS OF ARTISTS AND WRITERS CONTAINS OBSERVATIONS AND REFLECTIONS PROMPTED BY WAGNER. WITH THIS BOOK NIETZSCHE CAME INTO HIS OWN.

IN HIS LATER WORKS WAGNER IS OCCASIONALLY MENTIONED, BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL 1888, WHEN HIS INHIBITIONS HAD DECREASED DRASTICALLY, THAT HE PUBLISHED A SMALL VOLUME DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO ‚ÄÚTHE CASE OF WAGNER.‚ÄÙ THAT THIS BOOK ON WAGNER TROUBLED HIM, TOO, IS EVIDENT EVEN FROM ITS FORM: THERE IS A POSTSCRIPT OF CONSIDERABLE LENGTH, THEN A SECOND POSTSCRIPT, AND FINALLY AN EPILOGUE.

WAGNER WAS DEAD BY THEN, AND THE PROBLEM THAT CONFRONTED NIETZSCHE WAS IN PART SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH HEINE HAD RESOLVED WHEN HE HAD PUBLISHED ONE OF HIS BEST BOOKS, LUDWIG B√∂RNE (1840), AFTER B√∂RNE‚ÄÔS DEATH. THE BOOK HAD BEEN GREETED BY A STORM OF INDIGNATION, BUT MUCH LATER THOMAS MANN WAS TO SAY THAT OF HEINE‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚWORKS I HAVE LONG LOVED THE BOOK ON B√∂RNE MOST‚Ä¶. HIS PSYCHOLOGY OF THE NAZARENE TYPE ANTICIPATES NIETZSCHE‚Ä¶. AND INCIDENTALLY THIS BOOK CONTAINS THE MOST SUPERB GERMAN PROSE BEFORE NIETZSCHE. INCIDENTALLY? AH, ONLY THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND THE BLISSFULLY DISTRACTED SMILE WITH WHICH HE ANSWERED HIS FRIENDS WHEN THEY WARNED HIM, PRESENTING TO HIM THE HUMAN, PERSONAL, POLITICAL OFFENSIVENESS OF THE BOOK, ‚ÄÒBUT ISN‚ÄÔT IT EXPRESSED BEAUTIFULLY?‚ÄÔ‚ÄÎONLY THOSE COMPREHEND WHAT A MEMORABLE PHENOMENON THIS ARTIST JEW HAS BEEN AMONG GERMANS!‚ÄÙ6

AFTER THE STORM BROKE IN 1888, NIETZSCHE, WHO HAD MEANWHILE COMPLETED TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS AND THE ANTICHRIST, DIVIDED HIS TIME BETWEEN ECCE HOMO AND HIS FINAL EFFORT, NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER, WHICH HE FINISHED CHRISTMAS 1888, ONLY A FEW DAYS BEFORE HIS TOTAL COLLAPSE. THIS LAST BOOK CONSISTS OF PASSAGES ‚ÄÚSELECTED ‚Ä¶ FROM MY OLDER WRITINGS‚ÄÎSOME GO BACK ALL THE WAY TO 1877‚ÄÎPERHAPS CLARIFIED HERE AND THERE, ABOVE ALL, SHORTENED.‚ÄÙ7 THE BOOK WAS DESIGNED TO SHOW THAT THE CASE OF WAGNER HAD NOT BEEN INSPIRED BY SUDDEN MALICE, AND THAT NIETZSCHE HAD LONG TAKEN SIMILAR STANDS. NIETZSCHE SOMETIMES WROTE IN RELATIVE HASTE, THOUGH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BOOKS HE PREPARED FOR PUBLICATION AND THE NOTES OTHERS PUBLISHED AFTER HIS DEATH REMAINS VERY CONSIDERABLE. NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER IS PERHAPS HIS MOST BEAUTIFUL BOOK, AND THOSE SEEKING A COMMENTARY TO THE CASE OF WAGNER WOULD SURELY HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO THE LATER, STILL BRIEFER BOOK, HAD THEY ASKED THE AUTHOR.

THE PRESENT COMMENTARY CONSISTS OF THREE PARTS: THE TRANSLATOR‚ÄÔS INTRODUCTION, A NUMBER OF FOOTNOTES TO THE TRANSLATION, AND A SELECTION OF PERTINENT PASSAGES FROM NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CORRESPONDENCE OF 1888. A WEIGHTIER COMMENTARY DOES NOT SEEM NECESSARY‚ÄÎAND WOULD NOT BE IN THE SPIRIT OF THIS VERY SHORT AND ELEGANT WORK.

1SEE FREDERICK R. LOVE‚ÄÔS MONOGRAPH ON YOUNG NIETZSCHE AND THE WAGNERIAN EXPERIENCE (CHAPEL HILL, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA PRESS, 1963). LOVE‚ÄÔS MOST ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTION IS THAT HE SHOWS HOW ‚ÄÚTHE RECORD OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS COMPOSITIONS CLEARLY PROVIDES A BASIS FOR MODIFYING THE WIDELY HELD VIEW OF THE PHILOSOPHER AS A PASSIONATE DEVOTEE OF WAGNERIAN MUSIC‚ÄÙ (P. VIII). HE ALSO ARGUES THAT ‚ÄÚWAGNER‚ÄÔS MUSIC REMAINED FOR NIETZSCHE AN UNSOLVED PROBLEM FROM FIRST TO LAST, A PROBLEM THAT WAS TEMPORARILY SUPPRESSED DURING THE PERIOD OF HIS CLOSEST ASSOCIATION WITH THE COMPOSER‚ÄÙ (P. 80), AND THAT ‚ÄÚNIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS INFATUATION WITH WAGNERIAN MUSIC ‚Ä¶ MAY INDEED BE REGARDED AS AN ABERRATION‚ÄÙ (P. 82). IN OTHER WORDS, IN 1878 NIETZSCHE DID NOT BREAK FAITH WITH HIMSELF, AS THE WAGNERIANS HAVE CLAIMED, BUT BEGAN TO FIND HIMSELF.

PREFACE

I HAVE GRANTED MYSELF SOME SMALL RELIEF. IT IS NOT MERELY PURE MALICE WHEN I PRAISE BIZET IN THIS ESSAY AT THE EXPENSE OF WAGNER. INTERSPERSED WITH MANY JOKES, I BRING UP A MATTER THAT IS NO JOKE. TO TURN MY BACK ON WAGNER WAS FOR ME A FATE; TO LIKE ANYTHING AT ALL AGAIN AFTER THAT, A TRIUMPH. PERHAPS NOBODY WAS MORE DANGEROUSLY ATTACHED TO‚ÄÎGROWN TOGETHER WITH‚ÄÎWAGNERIZING; NOBODY TRIED HARDER TO RESIST IT; NOBODY WAS HAPPIER TO BE RID OF IT. A LONG STORY!‚ÄÎYOU WANT A WORD FOR IT?‚ÄÎIF I WERE A MORALIST, WHO KNOWS WHAT I MIGHT CALL IT? PERHAPS SELF-OVERCOMING.‚ÄÎBUT THE PHILOSOPHER HAS NO LOVE FOR MORALISTS. NEITHER DOES HE LOVE PRETTY WORDS.

WHAT DOES A PHILOSOPHER DEMAND OF HIMSELF FIRST AND LAST? TO OVERCOME HIS TIME IN HIMSELF, TO BECOME ‚ÄÚTIMELESS.‚ÄÙ WITH WHAT MUST HE THEREFORE ENGAGE IN THE HARDEST COMBAT? WITH WHATEVER MARKS HIM AS THE CHILD OF HIS TIME. WELL, THEN! I AM, NO LESS THAN WAGNER, A CHILD OF THIS TIME; THAT IS, A DECADENT: BUT I COMPREHENDED THIS, I RESISTED IT. THE PHILOSOPHER IN ME RESISTED.

NOTHING HAS PREOCCUPIED ME MORE PROFOUNDLY THAN THE PROBLEM OF DECADENCE‚ÄÎI HAD REASONS. ‚ÄÚGOOD AND EVIL‚ÄÙ IS MERELY A VARIATION OF THAT PROBLEM. ONCE ONE HAS DEVELOPED A KEEN EYE FOR THE SYMPTOMS OF DECLINE, ONE UNDERSTANDS MORALITY, TOO‚ÄÎONE UNDERSTANDS WHAT IS HIDING UNDER ITS MOST SACRED NAMES AND VALUE FORMULAS: IMPOVERISHED LIFE, THE WILL TO THE END, THE GREAT WEARINESS. MORALITY NEGATES LIFE.

FOR SUCH A TASK I REQUIRED A SPECIAL SELF-DISCIPLINE: TO TAKE SIDES AGAINST EVERYTHING SICK IN ME, INCLUDING WAGNER, INCLUDING SCHOPENHAUER, INCLUDING ALL OF MODERN ‚ÄÚHUMANENESS.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎA PROFOUND ESTRANGEMENT, COLD, SOBERING UP‚ÄÎAGAINST EVERYTHING THAT IS OF THIS TIME, EVERYTHING TIMELY‚ÄÎAND MOST DESIRABLE OF ALL, THE EYE OF ZARATHUSTRA, AN EYE THAT BEHOLDS THE WHOLE FACT OF MAN AT A TREMENDOUS DISTANCE‚ÄÎBELOW. FOR SUCH A GOAL‚ÄÎWHAT SACRIFICE WOULDN‚ÄÔT BE FITTING? WHAT ‚ÄÚSELF-OVERCOMING‚ÄÙ? WHAT ‚ÄÚSELF-DENIAL‚ÄÙ?

MY GREATEST EXPERIENCE WAS A RECOVERY. WAGNER IS MERELY ONE OF MY SICKNESSES.

NOT THAT I WISH TO BE UNGRATEFUL TO THIS SICKNESS. WHEN IN THIS ESSAY I ASSERT THE PROPOSITION THAT WAGNER IS HARMFUL, I WISH NO LESS TO ASSERT FOR WHOM HE IS NEVERTHELESS INDISPENSABLE‚ÄÎFOR THE PHILOSOPHER. OTHERS MAY BE ABLE TO GET ALONG WITHOUT WAGNER; BUT THE PHILOSOPHER IS NOT FREE TO DO WITHOUT WAGNER. HE HAS TO BE THE BAD CONSCIENCE OF HIS TIME:1 FOR THAT HE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND IT BEST. BUT CONFRONTED WITH THE LABYRINTH OF THE MODERN SOUL, WHERE COULD HE FIND A GUIDE MORE INITIATED, A MORE ELOQUENT PROPHET OF THE SOUL, THAN WAGNER? THROUGH WAGNER MODERNITY SPEAKS MOST INTIMATELY, CONCEALING NEITHER ITS GOOD NOR ITS EVIL‚ÄÎHAVING FORGOTTEN ALL SENSE OF SHAME. AND CONVERSELY: ONE HAS ALMOST COMPLETED AN ACCOUNT OF THE VALUE OF WHAT IS MODERN ONCE ONE HAS GAINED CLARITY ABOUT WHAT IS GOOD AND EVIL IN WAGNER.

I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY WHEN A MUSICIAN SAYS TODAY: ‚ÄÚI HATE WAGNER, BUT I CAN NO LONGER ENDURE ANY OTHER MUSIC.‚ÄÙ BUT I‚ÄÔD ALSO UNDERSTAND A PHILOSOPHER WHO WOULD DECLARE: ‚ÄÚWAGNER SUMS UP MODERNITY. THERE IS NO WAY OUT, ONE MUST FIRST BECOME A WAGNERIAN.‚ÄÙ

YESTERDAY I HEARD‚ÄÎWOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?‚ÄÎBIZET‚ÄÔS MASTERPIECE, FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME. AGAIN I STAYED THERE WITH TENDER DEVOTION; AGAIN I DID NOT RUN AWAY. THIS TRIUMPH OVER MY IMPATIENCE SURPRISES ME. HOW SUCH A WORK MAKES ONE PERFECT! ONE BECOMES A ‚ÄÚMASTERPIECE‚ÄÙ ONESELF.

REALLY, EVERY TIME I HEARD CARMEN I SEEMED TO MYSELF MORE OF A PHILOSOPHER, A BETTER PHILOSOPHER, THAN I GENERALLY CONSIDER MYSELF: SO PATIENT DO I BECOME, SO HAPPY, SO INDIAN, SO SETTLED.‚ÄÎTO SIT FIVE HOURS: THE FIRST STAGE OF HOLINESS!

MAY I SAY THAT THE TONE OF BIZET‚ÄÔS ORCHESTRA IS ALMOST THE ONLY ONE I CAN STILL ENDURE? THAT OTHER ORCHESTRAL TONE WHICH IS NOW THE FASHION, WAGNER‚ÄÔS, BRUTAL, ARTIFICIAL, AND ‚ÄÚINNOCENT‚ÄÙ AT THE SAME TIME‚ÄÎTHUS IT SPEAKS ALL AT ONCE TO THE THREE SENSES OF THE MODERN SOUL‚ÄÎHOW HARMFUL FOR ME IS THIS WAGNERIAN ORCHESTRAL TONE! I CALL IT SIROCCO. I BREAK OUT INTO A DISAGREEABLE SWEAT. MY GOOD WEATHER IS GONE.

THIS MUSIC SEEMS PERFECT TO ME. IT APPROACHES LIGHTLY, SUPPLELY, POLITELY. IT IS PLEASANT, IT DOES NOT SWEAT. ‚ÄÚWHAT IS GOOD IS LIGHT; WHATEVER IS DIVINE MOVES ON TENDER FEET‚ÄÙ: FIRST PRINCIPLE OF MY AESTHETICS. THIS MUSIC IS EVIL, SUBTLY FATALISTIC: AT THE SAME TIME IT REMAINS POPULAR‚ÄÎITS SUBTLETY BELONGS TO A RACE, NOT TO AN INDIVIDUAL. IT IS RICH. IT IS PRECISE. IT BUILDS, ORGANIZES, FINISHES: THUS IT CONSTITUTES THE OPPOSITE OF THE POLYP IN MUSIC, THE ‚ÄÚINFINITE MELODY.‚ÄÙ HAVE MORE PAINFUL TRAGIC ACCENTS EVER BEEN HEARD ON THE STAGE? HOW ARE THEY ACHIEVED? WITHOUT GRIMACES. WITHOUT COUNTERFEIT. WITHOUT THE LIE OF THE GREAT STYLE.

FINALLY, THIS MUSIC TREATS THE LISTENER AS INTELLIGENT, AS IF HIMSELF A MUSICIAN‚ÄÎAND IS IN THIS RESPECT, TOO, THE COUNTERPART OF WAGNER, WHO WAS, WHATEVER ELSE HE WAS, AT ANY RATE THE MOST IMPOLITE GENIUS IN THE WORLD (WAGNER TREATS US AS IF‚ÄÎHE SAYS SOMETHING SO OFTEN‚ÄÎTILL ONE DESPAIRS‚ÄÎTILL ONE BELIEVES IT).

ONCE MORE: I BECOME A BETTER HUMAN BEING WHEN THIS BIZET SPEAKS TO ME. ALSO A BETTER MUSICIAN, A BETTER LISTENER. IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TO LISTEN BETTER?‚ÄÎI ACTUALLY BURY MY EARS UNDER THIS MUSIC TO HEAR ITS CAUSES. IT SEEMS TO ME I EXPERIENCE ITS GENESIS‚ÄÎI TREMBLE BEFORE DANGERS THAT ACCOMPANY SOME STRANGE RISK; I AM DELIGHTED BY STROKES OF GOOD FORTUNE OF WHICH BIZET IS INNOCENT.‚ÄÎ AND, ODDLY, DEEP DOWN I DON‚ÄÔT THINK OF IT, OR DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HOW MUCH I THINK ABOUT IT. FOR ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THOUGHTS ARE MEANWHILE RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD.

HAS IT BEEN NOTICED THAT MUSIC LIBERATES THE SPIRIT? GIVES WINGS TO THOUGHT? THAT ONE BECOMES MORE OF A PHILOSOPHER THE MORE ONE BECOMES A MUSICIAN?‚ÄÎTHE GRAY SKY OF ABSTRACTION RENT AS IF BY LIGHTNING; THE LIGHT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE FILIGREE OF THINGS; THE GREAT PROBLEMS NEAR ENOUGH TO GRASP; THE WORLD SURVEYED AS FROM A MOUNTAIN.‚ÄÎI HAVE JUST DEFINED THE PATHOS OF PHILOSOPHY.‚ÄÎ AND UNEXPECTEDLY ANSWERS DROP INTO MY LAP, A LITTLE HAIL OF ICE AND WISDOM, OF SOLVED PROBLEMS.‚ÄÎWHERE AM I?‚ÄÎBIZET MAKES ME FERTILE. WHATEVER IS GOOD MAKES ME FERTILE. I HAVE NO OTHER GRATITUDE, NOR DO I HAVE ANY OTHER PROOF FOR WHAT IS GOOD.

THIS WORK, TOO, REDEEMS; WAGNER IS NOT THE ONLY ‚ÄÚREDEEMER.‚ÄÙ WITH THIS WORK ONE TAKES LEAVE OF THE DAMP NORTH, OF ALL THE STEAM OF THE WAGNERIAN IDEAL. EVEN THE PLOT SPELLS REDEMPTION FROM THAT. FROM M√©RIM√©E IT STILL HAS THE LOGIC IN PASSION, THE SHORTEST LINE, THE HARSH NECESSITY; ABOVE ALL, IT HAS WHAT GOES WITH THE TORRID ZONE: THE DRYNESS OF THE AIR, THE LIMPIDEZZA1 IN THE AIR. IN EVERY RESPECT, THE CLIMATE IS CHANGED. ANOTHER SENSUALITY, ANOTHER SENSIBILITY SPEAKS HERE, ANOTHER CHEERFULNESS. THIS MUSIC IS CHEERFUL,‚ÄÎBUT NOT IN A FRENCH OR GERMAN WAY. ITS CHEERFULNESS IS AFRICAN; FATE HANGS OVER IT; ITS HAPPINESS IS BRIEF, SUDDEN, WITHOUT PARDON. I ENVY BIZET FOR HAVING HAD THE COURAGE FOR THIS SENSIBILITY WHICH HAD HITHERTO HAD NO LANGUAGE IN THE CULTIVATED MUSIC OF EUROPE‚ÄÎFOR THIS MORE SOUTHERN, BROWN, BURNT SENSIBILITY.‚ÄÎHOW THE YELLOW AFTERNOONS OF ITS HAPPINESS DO US GOOD! WE LOOK INTO THE DISTANCE AS WE LISTEN: DID WE EVER FIND THE SEA SMOOTHER?‚ÄÎ AND HOW SOOTHINGLY THE MOORISH DANCE SPEAKS TO US? HOW EVEN OUR INSATIABILITY FOR ONCE GETS TO KNOW SATIETY IN THIS LASCIVIOUS MELANCHOLY!

FINALLY, LOVE‚ÄÎLOVE TRANSLATED BACK INTO NATURE. NOT THE LOVE OF A ‚ÄÚHIGHER VIRGIN‚ÄÙ! NO SENTA-SENTIMENTALITY!2 BUT LOVE AS FATUM, AS FATALITY, CYNICAL, INNOCENT, CRUEL‚ÄÎAND PRECISELY IN THIS A PIECE OF NATURE. THAT LOVE WHICH IS WAR IN ITS MEANS, AND AT BOTTOM THE DEADLY HATRED OF THE SEXES!‚ÄÎI KNOW NO CASE WHERE THE TRAGIC JOKE THAT CONSTITUTES THE ESSENCE OF LOVE IS EXPRESSED SO STRICTLY, TRANSLATED WITH EQUAL TERROR INTO A FORMULA, AS IN DON JOS√©‚ÄÔS LAST CRY, WHICH CONCLUDES THE WORK:

‚ÄÚYES. I HAVE KILLED HER,

I‚ÄÎMY ADORED CARMEN!‚ÄÙ



SUCH A CONCEPTION OF LOVE (THE ONLY ONE WORTHY OF A PHILOSOPHER) IS RARE: IT RAISES A WORK OF ART ABOVE THOUSANDS.3 FOR ON THE AVERAGE, ARTISTS DO WHAT ALL THE WORLD DOES, EVEN WORSE‚ÄÎTHEY MISUNDERSTAND LOVE. WAGNER, TOO, MISUNDERSTOOD IT. THEY BELIEVE ONE BECOMES SELFLESS IN LOVE BECAUSE ONE DESIRES THE ADVANTAGE OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING, OFTEN AGAINST ONE‚ÄÔS OWN ADVANTAGE. BUT IN RETURN FOR THAT THEY WANT TO POSSESS THE OTHER PERSON.‚ÄÎEVEN GOD DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXCEPTION AT THIS POINT. HE IS FAR FROM THINKING, ‚ÄÚWHAT IS IT TO YOU IF I LOVE YOU?‚ÄÙ4‚ÄÎHE BECOMES TERRIBLE WHEN ONE DOES NOT LOVE HIM IN RETURN. L‚ÄÔAMOUR‚ÄÎTHIS SAYING REMAINS TRUE AMONG GODS AND MEN‚ÄÎEST DE TOUS LES SENTIMENTS LE PLUS √©GO√ØSTE, ET PAR CONS√©QUENT, LORSQU‚ÄÔIL EST BLESS√©, LE MOINS G√©N√©REUX. (B. CONSTANT.)5

YOU BEGIN TO SEE HOW MUCH THIS MUSIC IMPROVES ME?‚ÄÎIL FAUT M√©DITERRANISER LA MUSIQUE:1 I HAVE REASONS FOR THIS FORMULA (BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, APH. 255). THE RETURN TO NATURE, HEALTH, CHEERFULNESS, YOUTH, VIRTUE!‚ÄÎ AND YET I WAS ONE OF THE MOST CORRUPTED WAGNERIANS.‚ÄÎI WAS CAPABLE OF TAKING WAGNER SERIOUSLY.‚ÄÎAH, THIS OLD MAGICIAN, HOW MUCH HE IMPOSED UPON US! THE FIRST THING HIS ART OFFERS US IS A MAGNIFYING GLASS: ONE LOOKS THROUGH IT, ONE DOES NOT TRUST ONE‚ÄÔS OWN EYES‚ÄÎEVERYTHING LOOKS BIG, EVEN WAGNER.‚ÄÎWHAT A CLEVER RATTLESNAKE! IT HAS FILLED OUR WHOLE LIFE WITH ITS RATTLING ABOUT ‚ÄÚDEVOTION,‚ÄÙ ABOUT ‚ÄÚLOYALTY,‚ÄÙ ABOUT ‚ÄÚPURITY;‚ÄÙ AND WITH ITS PRAISE OF CHASTITY IT WITHDREW FROM THE CORRUPTED WORLD.‚ÄÎ AND WE BELIEVED IT IN ALL THESE THINGS.‚ÄÎ

BUT YOU DO NOT HEAR ME? YOU, TOO, PREFER WAGNER‚ÄÔS PROBLEM TO BIZET‚ÄÔS? I, TOO, DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE IT; IT HAS ITS PECULIAR MAGIC. THE PROBLEM OF REDEMPTION IS CERTAINLY A VENERABLE PROBLEM. THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT WHICH WAGNER HAS THOUGHT MORE DEEPLY THAN REDEMPTION: HIS OPERA IS THE OPERA OF REDEMPTION. SOMEBODY OR OTHER ALWAYS WANTS TO BE REDEEMED IN HIS WORK: SOMETIMES A LITTLE MALE, SOMETIMES A LITTLE FEMALE‚ÄÎTHIS IS HIS PROBLEM.‚ÄÎ AND HOW RICHLY HE VARIES HIS LEITMOTIF! WHAT RARE, WHAT PROFOUND DODGES! WHO IF NOT WAGNER WOULD TEACH US THAT INNOCENCE PREFERS TO REDEEM INTERESTING SINNERS? (THE CASE IN TANNH√§USER.) OR THAT EVEN THE WANDERING JEW IS REDEEMED, SETTLES DOWN, WHEN HE MARRIES? (THE CASE IN THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.) OR THAT OLD CORRUPTED FEMALES PREFER TO BE REDEEMED BY CHASTE YOUTHS? (THE CASE OF KUNDRY.2) OR THAT BEAUTIFUL MAIDENS LIKE BEST TO BE REDEEMED BY A KNIGHT WHO IS A WAGNERIAN? (THE CASE IN DIE MEISTERSINGER.) OR THAT MARRIED WOMEN, TOO, ENJOY BEING REDEEMED BY A KNIGHT? (THE CASE OF ISOLDE.) OR THAT ‚ÄÚTHE OLD GOA,‚ÄÙ AFTER HAVING COMPROMISED HIMSELF MORALLY IN EVERY RESPECT, IS FINALLY REDEEMED BY A FREE SPIRIT AND IMMORALIST? (THE CASE IN THE RING.) DO ADMIRE THIS FINAL PROFUNDITY ABOVE ALL! DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT? I‚ÄÎBEWARE OF UNDERSTANDING IT.

THAT YET OTHER LESSONS MAY BE LEARNED FROM THE WORKS JUST NAMED I‚ÄÔD SOONER DEMONSTRATE THAN DENY. THAT A WAGNERIAN BALLET MAY DRIVE ONE TO DESPAIR‚ÄÎAND VIRTUE! (AGAIN THE CASE OF TANNH√§USER.) THAT IT MAY HAVE THE DIREST CONSEQUENCES IF ONE DOESN‚ÄÔT GO TO BED AT THE RIGHT TIME. (ONCE MORE THE CASE OF LOHENGRIN.) THAT ONE SHOULD NEVER KNOW TOO PRECISELY WHOM EXACTLY ONE HAS MARRIED. (FOR THE THIRD TIME, THE CASE OF LOHENGRIN.)

TRISTAN AND ISOLDE GLORIFIES THE PERFECT SPOUSE WHO IN A CERTAIN CASE HAS ONLY THE SINGLE QUESTION: ‚ÄÚBUT WHY DIDN‚ÄÔT YOU TELL ME THIS BEFORE? NOTHING SIMPLER THAN THAT!‚ÄÙ ANSWER:

‚ÄÚTHAT I MAY NOT TELL YOU;

AND WHAT YOU ASK

YOU MAY NEVER KNOW.‚ÄÙ



LOHENGRIN CONTAINS A SOLEMN EXCOMMUNICATION OF INQUIRY AND QUESTIONING. WAGNER THUS REPRESENTS THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPT, ‚ÄÚYOU OUGHT TO AND MUST BELIEVE‚ÄÙ IT IS A CRIME AGAINST WHAT IS HIGHEST AND HOLIEST TO BE SCIENTIFIC.

THE FLYING DUTCHMAN PREACHES THE SUBLIME DOCTRINE THAT WOMAN MAKES EVEN THE MOST RESTLESS MAN STABLE; IN WAGNERIAN TERMS, SHE ‚ÄÚREDEEMS‚ÄÙ HIM. HERE WE PERMIT OURSELVES A QUESTION. SUPPOSING THIS WERE TRUE, WOULD IT ALSO BE DESIRABLE?

WHAT BECOMES OF THE ‚ÄÚWANDERING JEW‚ÄÙ3 WHOM A WOMAN ADORES AND MAKES STABLE? HE MERELY CEASES TO BE ETERNAL; HE GETS MARRIED, HE IS OF NO FURTHER CONCERN TO US.

TRANSLATED INTO REALITY: THE DANGER FOR ARTISTS, FOR GENIUSES‚ÄÎAND WHO ELSE IS THE ‚ÄÚWANDERING JEW‚ÄÙ?‚ÄÎIS WOMAN: ADORING WOMEN CONFRONT THEM WITH CORRUPTION. HARDLY ANY OF THEM HAVE CHARACTER ENOUGH NOT TO BE CORRUPTED‚ÄÎOR ‚ÄÚREDEEMED‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWHEN THEY FIND THEMSELVES TREATED LIKE GODS: SOON THEY CONDESCEND TO THE LEVEL OF THE WOMEN.‚ÄÎMAN IS A COWARD, CONFRONTED WITH THE ETERNAL-FEMININE4‚ÄÎAND THE FEMALES KNOW IT.‚ÄÎIN MANY CASES OF FEMININE LOVE, PERHAPS INCLUDING THE MOST FAMOUS ONES ABOVE ALL, LOVE IS MERELY A MORE REFINED FORM OF PARASITISM, A FORM OF NESTLING DOWN IN ANOTHER SOUL, SOMETIMES EVEN IN THE FLESH OF ANOTHER‚ÄÎALAS, ALWAYS DECIDEDLY AT THE EXPENSE OF ‚ÄÚTHE HOST‚ÄÙ!

ONE KNOWS GOETHE‚ÄÔS FATE IN MORALINE-SOUR, OLD-MAIDISH GERMANY. HE ALWAYS SEEMED OFFENSIVE TO GERMANS; HE HAD HONEST ADMIRERS ONLY AMONG JEWESSES. SCHILLER, THE ‚ÄÚNOBLE‚ÄÙ SCHILLER, WHO LAMBASTED THE EARS OF THE GERMANS WITH BIG WORDS‚ÄÎHE WAS AFTER THEIR HEARTS. WHAT DID THEY HOLD AGAINST GOETHE? THE ‚ÄÚMOUNT OF VENUS;‚ÄÙ AND THAT HE HAD WRITTEN VENETIAN EPIGRAMS. KLOPSTOCK5 ALREADY FELT CALLED UPON TO DELIVER A MORAL SERMON TO HIM; THERE WAS A TIME WHEN HERDER6 LIKED TO USE THE WORD ‚ÄÚPRIAPUS‚ÄÙ WHENEVER HE SPOKE OF GOETHE. EVEN WILHELM MEISTER WAS CONSIDERED MERELY A SYMPTOM OF DECLINE, ‚ÄÚGOING TO THE DOGS‚ÄÙ AS FAR AS MORALS GO. NIEBUHR,7 FOR EXAMPLE, WAS ENRAGED BY THE ‚ÄÚMENAGERIE OF TAME ANIMALS‚ÄÙ AND THE ‚ÄÚWORTHLESSNESS‚ÄÙ OF THE HERO, AND FINALLY HE BROKE OUT INTO THE LAMENT, FIT TO BE SUNG BY BITEROLF:8 ‚ÄÚNOTHING COULD EASILY MAKE A MORE PAINFUL IMPRESSION THAN A GREAT SPIRIT WHO DEPRIVES HIMSELF OF HIS WINGS AND SEEKS VIRTUOSITY IN SOMETHING MUCH INFERIOR, RENOUNCING WHAT IS HIGHER.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎABOVE ALL, HOWEVER, THE HIGHER VIRGINS WERE INDIGNANT: ALL THE PETTY COURTS, EVERY KIND OF ‚ÄÚWARTBURG‚ÄÙ9 IN GERMANY CROSSED THEMSELVES AGAINST GOETHE, AGAINST THE ‚ÄÚUNCLEAN SPIRIT‚ÄÙ IN GOETHE.

THIS IS THE STORY WAGNER PUT INTO MUSIC. HE REDEEMS GOETHE, THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING; BUT IN SUCH A WAY THAT AT THE SAME TIME HE HIMSELF SIDES SHREWDLY WITH THE HIGHER VIRGIN. GOETHE IS SAVED: A PRAYER SAVES HIM, A HIGHER VIRGIN LURES HIM TO PERFECTION.

WHAT GOETHE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT OF WAGNER?‚ÄÎGOETHE ONCE ASKED HIMSELF WHAT DANGER THREATENED ALL ROMANTICS: THE FATALITY OF ROMANTICISM. HIS ANSWER WAS: ‚ÄÚSUFFOCATING OF THE RUMINATION OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS ABSURDITIES.‚ÄÙ IN BRIEF: PARSIFAL.

THE PHILOSOPHER ADDS AN EPILOGUE TO THIS: HOLINESS‚ÄÎPERHAPS THE LAST THING THE PEOPLE AND WOMEN STILL GET TO SEE OF HIGHER VALUES, THE HORIZON OF THE IDEAL FOR ALL WHO ARE BY NATURE MYOPIC. BUT AMONG PHILOSOPHERS THIS IS, LIKE EVERY HORIZON, A MERE CASE OF LACK OF UNDERSTANDING, A SORT OF SHUTTING THE GATE AT THE POINT WHERE THEIR WORLD ONLY BEGINS‚ÄÎTHEIR DANGER, THEIR IDEAL, THEIR DESIDERATUM.‚ÄÎTO SAY IT MORE POLITELY: LA PHILOSOPHIE NE SUFFIT PAS AU GRAND NOMBRE. IL LUI FAUT LA SAINTET√©.‚ÄÎ10

I SHALL STILL RELATE THE STORY OF THE RING. IT BELONGS HERE. IT, TOO, IS A STORY OF REDEMPTION: ONLY THIS TIME IT IS WAGNER WHO IS REDEEMED.‚ÄÎ

HALF HIS LIFE, WAGNER BELIEVED IN THE REVOLUTION AS MUCH AS EVER A FRENCHMAN BELIEVED IN IT. HE SEARCHED FOR IT IN THE RUNIC WRITING OF MYTH, HE BELIEVED THAT IN SIEGFRIED HE HAD FOUND THE TYPICAL REVOLUTIONARY.

‚ÄÚWHENCE COMES ALL MISFORTUNE IN THE WORLD?‚ÄÙ WAGNER ASKED HIMSELF. FROM ‚ÄÚOLD CONTRACTS,‚ÄÙ HE ANSWERED, LIKE ALL REVOLUTIONARY IDEOLOGISTS. IN PLAIN: FROM CUSTOMS, LAWS, MORALITIES, INSTITUTIONS, FROM EVERYTHING ON WHICH THE OLD WORLD, THE OLD SOCIETY RESTS. ‚ÄÚHOW CAN ONE RID THE WORLD OF MISFORTUNE? HOW CAN ONE ABOLISH THE OLD SOCIETY?‚ÄÙ ONLY BY DECLARING WAR AGAINST ‚ÄÚCONTRACTS‚ÄÙ (TRADITION, MORALITY). THAT IS WHAT SIEGFRIED DOES. HE STARTS EARLY, VERY EARLY: HIS VERY GENESIS IS A DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST MORALITY‚ÄÎHE COMES INTO THIS WORLD THROUGH ADULTERY, THROUGH INCEST.‚ÄÎIT IS NOT THE SAGA BUT WAGNER WHO INVENTED THIS RADICAL TRAIT; AT THIS POINT HE REVISED THE SAGA.

SIEGFRIED CONTINUES AS HE HAS BEGUN: HE MERELY FOLLOWS HIS FIRST IMPULSE, HE OVERTHROWS EVERYTHING TRADITIONAL, ALL REVERENCE, ALL FEAR. WHATEVER DISPLEASES HIM HE STABS TO DEATH. WITHOUT THE LEAST RESPECT, HE TACKLES OLD DEITIES. BUT HIS MAIN ENTERPRISE AIMS TO EMANCIPATE WOMAN‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚTO REDEEM BRUNHILDE.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎSIEGFRIED AND BRUNHILDE; THE SACRAMENT OF FREE LOVE; THE RISE OF THE GOLDEN AGE; THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS FOR THE OLD MORALITY‚ÄÎALL ILL HAS BEEN ABOLISHED.

FOR A LONG TIME, WAGNER‚ÄÔS SHIP FOLLOWED THIS COURSE GAILY. NO DOUBT, THIS WAS WHERE WAGNER SOUGHT HIS HIGHEST GOAL.‚ÄÎWHAT HAPPENED? A MISFORTUNE. THE SHIP STRUCK A REEF; WAGNER WAS STUCK. THE REEF WAS SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS PHILOSOPHY; WAGNER WAS STRANDED ON A CONTRARY WORLD VIEW. WHAT HAD HE TRANSPOSED INTO MUSIC? OPTIMISM. WAGNER WAS ASHAMED. EVEN AN OPTIMISM FOR WHICH SCHOPENHAUER HAD COINED AN EVIL EPITHET‚ÄÎINFAMOUS1 OPTIMISM. HE WAS ASHAMED A SECOND TIME. HE REFLECTED FOR A LONG WHILE, HIS SITUATION SEEMED DESPERATE.‚ÄÎFINALLY, A WAY OUT DAWNED ON HIM: THE REEF ON WHICH HE WAS SHIPWRECKED‚ÄÎWHAT IF HE INTERPRETED IT AS THE GOAL, AS THE SECRET INTENT, AS THE TRUE SIGNIFICANCE OF HIS VOYAGE? TO BE SHIPWRECKED HERE‚ÄÎTHAT WAS A GOAL, TOO. BENE NAVIGAVI, CUM NAUFRAGIUM FECI.2

SO HE TRANSLATED THE RING INTO SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS TERMS. EVERYTHING GOES WRONG, EVERYTHING PERISHES, THE NEW WORLD IS AS BAD AS THE OLD: THE NOTHING, THE INDIAN CIRCE BECKONS.

BRUNHILDE WAS INITIALLY SUPPOSED TO TAKE HER FAREWELL WITH A SONG IN HONOR OF FREE LOVE, PUTTING OFF THE WORLD WITH THE HOPE FOR A SOCIALIST UTOPIA IN WHICH ‚ÄÚALL TURNS OUT WELL‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎBUT NOW GETS SOMETHING ELSE TO DO. SHE HAS TO STUDY SCHOPENHAUER FIRST; SHE HAS TO TRANSPOSE THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE WORLD AS WILL AND REPRESENTATION INTO VERSE. WAGNER WAS REDEEMED.

IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, THIS WAS A REDEMPTION. THE BENEFIT SCHOPENHAUER CONFERRED ON WAGNER IS IMMEASURABLE. ONLY THE PHILOSOPHER OF-DECADENCE GAVE TO THE ARTIST OF DECADENCE‚ÄÎHIMSELF.





5


TO THE ARTIST OF DECADENCE: THERE WE HAVE THE CRUCIAL WORDS. AND HERE MY SERIOUSNESS BEGINS. I AM FAR FROM LOOKING ON GUILELESSLY WHILE THIS DECADENT CORRUPTS OUR HEALTH‚ÄÎAND MUSIC AS WELL. IS WAGNER A HUMAN BEING AT ALL? ISN‚ÄÔT HE RATHER A SICKNESS? HE MAKES SICK WHATEVER HE TOUCHES‚ÄÎHE HAS MADE MUSIC SICK‚ÄÎ

A TYPICAL DECADENT WHO HAS A SENSE OF NECESSITY IN HIS CORRUPTED TASTE, WHO CLAIMS IT AS A HIGHER TASTE, WHO KNOWS HOW TO GET HIS CORRUPTION ACCEPTED AS LAW, AS PROGRESS, AS FULFILLMENT.

AND HE IS NOT RESISTED. HIS SEDUCTIVE FORCE INCREASES TREMENDOUSLY, SMOKE CLOUDS OF INCENSE SURROUND HIM, THE MISUNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT HIM PARADE AS ‚ÄÚGOSPEL‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHE HASN‚ÄÔT BY ANY MEANS CONVERTED ONLY THE POOR IN SPIRIT.

I FEEL THE URGE TO OPEN THE WINDOWS A LITTLE. AIR! MORE AIR!‚ÄÎ1

THAT PEOPLE IN GERMANY SHOULD DECEIVE THEMSELVES ABOUT WAGNER DOES NOT SURPRISE ME. THE OPPOSITE WOULD SURPRISE ME. THE GERMANS HAVE CONSTRUCTED A WAGNER FOR THEMSELVES WHOM THEY CAN REVERE: THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN PSYCHOLOGISTS; THEIR GRATITUDE CONSISTS IN MISUNDERSTANDING. BUT THAT PEOPLE IN PARIS, TOO, DECEIVE THEMSELVES ABOUT WAGNER, THOUGH THERE THEY ARE HARDLY ANYTHING ANYMORE EXCEPT PSYCHOLOGISTS! AND IN ST. PETERSBURG, WHERE THEY GUESS THINGS THAT AREN‚ÄÔT GUESSED EVEN IN PARIS! HOW CLOSELY RELATED WAGNER MUST BE TO THE WHOLE OF EUROPEAN DECADENCE TO AVOID BEING EXPERIENCED BY THEM AS A DECADENT. HE BELONGS TO IT: HE IS ITS PROTAGONIST, ITS GREATEST NAME.‚ÄÎONE HONORS ONESELF WHEN RAISING HIM TO THE CLOUDS.

FOR THAT ONE DOES NOT RESIST HIM, THIS ITSELF IS A SIGN OF DECADENCE. THE INSTINCTS ARE WEAKENED. WHAT ONE OUGHT TO SHUN IS FOUND ATTRACTIVE. ONE PUTS TO ONE‚ÄÔS LIPS WHAT DRIVES ONE YET FASTER INTO THE ABYSS.

IS AN EXAMPLE DESIRED? ONE ONLY NEED OBSERVE THE REGIMEN THAT THOSE SUFFERING FROM ANEMIA OR GOUT OR DIABETES PRESCRIBE FOR THEMSELVES. DEFINITION OF A VEGETARIAN: ONE WHO REQUIRES A CORROBORANT DIET. TO SENSE THAT WHAT IS HARMFUL IS HARMFUL, TO BE ABLE TO FORBID ONESELF SOMETHING HARMFUL, IS A SIGN OF YOUTH AND VITALITY. THE EXHAUSTED ARE ATTRACTED BY WHAT IS HARMFUL: THE VEGETARIAN BY VEGETABLES.2 SICKNESS ITSELF CAN BE A STIMULANT TO LIFE: ONLY ONE HAS TO BE HEALTHY ENOUGH FOR THIS STIMULANT.3

WAGNER INCREASES EXHAUSTION: THAT IS WHY HE ATTRACTS THE WEAK AND EXHAUSTED. OH, THE RATTLESNAKE-HAPPINESS OF THE OLD MASTER WHEN HE ALWAYS SAW PRECISELY ‚ÄÚTHE LITTLE CHILDREN‚ÄÙ COMING UNTO HIM!4

I PLACE THIS PERSPECTIVE AT THE OUTSET: WAGNER‚ÄÔS ART IS SICK. THE PROBLEMS HE PRESENTS ON THE STAGE‚ÄÎALL OF THEM PROBLEMS OF HYSTERICS‚ÄÎTHE CONVULSIVE NATURE OF HIS AFFECTS, HIS OVEREXCITED SENSIBILITY, HIS TASTE THAT REQUIRED EVER STRONGER SPICES, HIS INSTABILITY WHICH HE DRESSED UP AS PRINCIPLES, NOT LEAST OF ALL THE CHOICE OF HIS HEROES AND HEROINES‚ÄÎCONSIDER THEM AS PHYSIOLOGICAL TYPES (A PATHOLOGICAL GALLERY)!‚ÄÎALL OF THIS TAKEN TOGETHER REPRESENTS A PROFILE OF SICKNESS THAT PERMITS NO FURTHER DOUBT. WAGNER EST UNE N√©VROSE.5 PERHAPS NOTHING IS BETTER KNOWN TODAY, AT LEAST NOTHING HAS BEEN BETTER STUDIED, THAN THE PROTEAN CHARACTER OF DEGENERATION THAT HERE CONCEALS ITSELF IN THE CHRYSALIS OF ART AND ARTIST. OUR PHYSICIANS AND PHYSIOLOGISTS CONFRONT THEIR MOST INTERESTING CASE IN WAGNER, AT LEAST A VERY COMPLETE CASE. PRECISELY BECAUSE NOTHING IS MORE MODERN THAN THIS TOTAL SICKNESS, THIS LATENESS AND OVEREXCITEMENT OF THE NERVOUS MECHANISM, WAGNER IS THE MODERN ARTIST PAR EXCELLENCE, THE CAGLIOSTRO OF MODERNITY. IN HIS ART ALL THAT THE MODERN WORLD REQUIRES MOST URGENTLY IS MIXED IN THE MOST SEDUCTIVE MANNER: THE THREE GREAT STIMULANTIA OF THE EXHAUSTED‚ÄÎTHE BRUTAL, THE ARTIFICIAL, AND THE INNOCENT (IDIOTIC).6

WAGNER REPRESENTS A GREAT CORRUPTION OF MUSIC. HE HAS GUESSED THAT IT IS A MEANS TO EXCITE WEARY NERVES‚ÄÎAND WITH THAT HE HAS MADE MUSIC SICK. HIS INVENTIVENESS IS NOT INCONSIDERABLE IN THE ART OF GOADING AGAIN THOSE WHO ARE WEARIEST, CALLING BACK INTO LIFE THOSE WHO ARE HALF DEAD. HE IS A MASTER OF HYPNOTIC TRICKS, HE MANAGES TO THROW DOWN THE STRONGEST LIKE BULLS. WAGNER‚ÄÔS SUCCESS‚ÄÎHIS SUCCESS WITH NERVES AND CONSEQUENTLY WOMEN‚ÄÎHAS TURNED THE WHOLE WORLD OF AMBITIOUS MUSICIANS INTO DISCIPLES OF HIS SECRET ART, AND NOT ONLY THE AMBITIOUS, THE CLEVER, TOO.‚ÄÎONLY SICK MUSIC MAKES MONEY TODAY; OUR BIG THEATERS SUBSIST ON WAGNER.





6


I PERMIT MYSELF SOME EXHILARATION AGAIN. SUPPOSE IT WERE THE CASE THAT WAGNER‚ÄÔS SUCCESS BECAME INCARNATE, TOOK HUMAN FORM AND, DRESSED UP AS A PHILANTHROPIC MUSIC SCHOLAR, MIXED WITH YOUNG ARTISTS. HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE HE WOULD TALK?

MY FRIENDS, HE WOULD SAY, LET US HAVE A FEW WORDS AMONG OURSELVES. IT IS EASIER TO WRITE BAD MUSIC THAN GOOD. WHAT IF IT WERE MORE PROFITABLE, TOO? MORE EFFECTIVE, PERSUASIVE, INSPIRING, RELIABLE‚ÄÎWAGNERIAN?‚ÄÎPULCHRUM EST PAUCORUM HOMINUM.1 BAD ENOUGH. WE UNDERSTAND LATIN; PERHAPS WE ALSO UNDERSTAND OUR OWN ADVANTAGE. WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL HAS A FLY IN ITS OINTMENT: WE KNOW THAT. WHY, THEN, HAVE BEAUTY? WHY NOT RATHER THAT WHICH IS GREAT, SUBLIME, GIGANTIC‚ÄÎTHAT WHICH MOVES MASSES?‚ÄÎ ONCE MORE: IT IS EASIER TO BE GIGANTIC THAN TO BE BEAUTIFUL; WE KNOW THAT.

WE KNOW THE MASSES, WE KNOW THE THEATER. THE BEST AMONG THOSE WHO SIT THERE‚ÄÎGERMAN YOUTHS, HORNED SIEGFRIEDS, AND OTHER WAGNERIANS‚ÄÎREQUIRE THE SUBLIME, THE PROFOUND, THE OVERWHELMING. THAT MUCH WE ARE CAPABLE OF. AND THE OTHERS WHO ALSO SIT THERE‚ÄÎTHE CULTURE CR√©TINS, THE PETTY SNOBS, THE ETERNALLY FEMININE, THOSE WITH A HAPPY DIGESTION, IN SUM, THE PEOPLE‚ÄÎALSO REQUIRE THE SUBLIME, THE PROFOUND, THE OVERWHELMING. THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME LOGIC. ‚ÄÚWHOEVER THROWS US IS STRONG; WHOEVER ELEVATES US IS DIVINE; WHOEVER LEADS US TO HAVE INTIMATIONS IS PROFOUND.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎLET US MAKE UP OUR MINDS, HONORED MUSICIANS: WE WANT TO THROW THEM, WE WANT TO ELEVATE THEM, WE WANT TO LEAD THEM TO HAVE INTIMATIONS. THAT MUCH WE ARE CAPABLE OF.

REGARDING THE MATTER OF INDUCING INTIMATIONS: THIS IS THE POINT OF DEPARTURE FOR OUR CONCEPT OF ‚ÄÚSTYLE.‚ÄÙ ABOVE ALL, NO THOUGHT! NOTHING IS MORE COMPROMISING THAN A THOUGHT. RATHER THE STATE PRECEDING THOUGHT, THE THRONG OF YET UNBORN THOUGHTS, THE PROMISE OF FUTURE THOUGHTS, THE WORLD AS IT WAS BEFORE GOD CREATED IT‚ÄÎA RECRUDESCENCE OF CHAOS.‚ÄÎCHAOS INDUCES INTIMATIONS.

TO SPEAK IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE MASTER: INFINITY, BUT WITHOUT MELODY.

SECONDLY, AS FAR AS THROWING PEOPLE IS CONCERNED, THIS REALLY BELONGS PARTLY IN PHYSIOLOGY. LET US STUDY THE INSTRUMENTS ABOVE ALL. SOME OF THEM PERSUADE EVEN THE INTESTINES (THEY OPEN THE GATES, AS HANDEL PUT IT); OTHERS BEWITCH THE MARROW OF THE SPINE. THE COLOR OF THE TONE IS DECISIVE; WHAT IT IS THAT RESOUNDS IS ALMOST A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE. THIS IS THE POINT TO REFINE. WHY SQUANDER OURSELVES? REGARDING THE TONE, LET US BE CHARACTERISTIC TO THE POINT OF FOLLY. PEOPLE WILL GIVE CREDIT TO OUR SPIRIT IF OUR TONES SEEM TO POSE MANY RIDDLES. LET US AGITATE THE NERVES, LET US SLAY THEM, LET US HANDLE LIGHTNING AND THUNDER‚ÄÎTHAT WILL THROW THEM.‚ÄÎ

ABOVE ALL, HOWEVER, PASSION THROWS PEOPLE.‚ÄÎLET US REACH AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT PASSION. NOTHING IS CHEAPER THAN PASSION. ONE CAN DISPENSE WITH ALL THE VIRTUES OF COUNTERPOINT, ONE NEED NOT HAVE LEARNED A THING‚ÄÎPASSION IS ONE ABILITY WE ALWAYS HAVE. BEAUTY IS DIFFICULT: BEWARE OF BEAUFY!‚ÄÎ AND MELODY! SLANDER, MY FRIENDS, LET US SLANDER, IF WE ARE AT ALL SERIOUS ABOUT OUR IDEAL, LET US SLANDER MELODY! NOTHING IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN A BEAUTIFUL MELODY. NOTHING CORRUPTS TASTE MORE SURELY. WE ARE LOST, MY FRIENDS, ONCE BEAUTIFUL MELODIES ARE LOVED AGAIN!‚ÄÎ

PRINCIPLE: MELODY IS IMMORAL. PROOF: PALESTRINA. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: PARSIFAL THE LACK OF MELODY EVEN SANCTIFIES.‚ÄÎ

AND THIS IS THE DEFINITION OF PASSION. PASSION‚ÄÎOR THE GYMNASTICS OF WHAT IS UGLY ON THE ROPE OF ENHARMONICS.‚ÄÎLET US DARE, MY FRIENDS, TO BE UGLY. WAGNER HAS DARED IT. LET US DAUNTLESSLY ROLL IN FRONT OF US THE MUD OF THE MOST CONTRARY HARMONIES. LET US NOT SPARE OUR HANDS. ONLY THUS WILL WE BECOME NATURAL.

A FINAL BIT OF ADVICE! PERHAPS IT INCLUDES EVERYTHING ELSE. LET US BE IDEALISTS! THIS IS, IF NOT THE CLEVEREST THING WE CAN DO AT LEAST THE WISEST. TO ELEVATE2 MEN ONE HAS TO BE SUBLIME3 ONESELF. LET US WALK ON CLOUDS, LET US HARANGUE THE INFINITE, LET US SURROUND OURSELVES WITH SYMBOLS! SURSUM! BUMBUM!‚ÄÎTHERE IS NO BETTER ADVICE. THE ‚ÄÚSWELLED BOSOM‚ÄÙ SHALL BE OUR ARGUMENT, THE BEAUTIFUL SENTIMENT OUR ADVOCATE. VIRTUE PREVAILS EVEN OVER COUNTERPOINT. ‚ÄÚWHOEVER MAKES US BETTER CANNOT FAIL TO BE GOOD HIMSELF‚ÄÙ: THUS MANKIND HAS ALWAYS INFERRED. SO LET US IMPROVE MANKIND!4 THUS ONE BECOMES COMES GOOD (THUS ONE EVEN BECOMES A ‚ÄÚCLASSIC‚ÄÙ5‚ÄÎSCHILLER BECAME A ‚ÄÚCLASSIC‚ÄÙ). THE HUNT FOR LOW EXCITEMENT OF THE SENSES, FOR SO-CALLED BEAUTY, HAS ENERVATED THE ITALIANS: LET US REMAIN GERMAN! EVEN MOZART‚ÄÔS ATTITUDE TO MUSIC WAS‚ÄÎAS WAGNER SAID TO COMFORT US‚ÄÎAT BOTTOM FRIVOLOUS.

LET US NEVER ADMIT THAT MUSIC ‚ÄÚSERVES RECREATION;‚ÄÙ THAT IT ‚ÄÚEXHILARATES;‚ÄÙ THAT IT ‚ÄÚGIVES PLEASURE.‚ÄÙ LET US NEVER GIVE PLEASURE! WE ARE LOST AS SOON AS ART IS AGAIN THOUGHT OF HEDONISTICALLY.‚ÄÎTHAT IS BAD EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.‚ÄÎNOTHING ON THE OTHER HAND SHOULD BE MORE ADVISABLE THAN A DOSE OF‚ÄÎHYPOCRISY, SIT VENIA VERBO.6 THAT LENDS DIGNITY.‚ÄÎ AND LET US CHOOSE THE HOUR WHEN IT IS DECENT TO LOOK BLACK, TO HEAVE SIGHS PUBLICLY, TO HEAVE CHRISTIAN SIGHS, TO MAKE AN EXHIBITION OF GREAT CHRISTIAN PITY. ‚ÄÚMAN IS CORRUPT: WHO REDEEMS HIM? WHAT REDEEMS HIM?‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎLET US NOT ANSWER. LET US BE CAUTIOUS. LET US RESIST OUR AMBITION WHICH WOULD FOUND RELIGIONS. BUT NOBODY MAY DOUBT THAT WE REDEEM HIM, THAT OUR MUSIC ALONE SAVES.‚ÄÎ(WAGNER‚ÄÔS ESSAY, RELIGION AND ART.)

ENOUGH! ENOUGH! MY CHEERFUL STROKES, I FEAR, MAY HAVE REVEALED SINISTER REALITY ALL TOO CLEARLY‚ÄÎTHE PICTURE OF A DECAY OF ART, A DECAY OF THE ARTISTS AS WELL. THE LATTER, THE DECAY OF A CHARACTER, COULD PERHAPS FIND PRELIMINARY EXPRESSION IN THIS FORMULA: THE MUSICIAN NOW BECOMES AN ACTOR, HIS ART DEVELOPS MORE AND MORE AS A TALENT TO LIE. I SHALL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY (IN A CHAPTER OF MY MAIN WORK, ENTITLED ‚ÄÚTOWARD A PHYSIOLOGY OF ART‚ÄÙ1) TO SHOW IN MORE DETAIL HOW THIS OVER-ALL CHANGE OF ART INTO HISTRIONICS IS NO LESS AN EXPRESSION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL DEGENERATION (MORE PRECISELY, A FORM OF HYSTERICISM) THAN EVERY SINGLE CORRUPTION AND INFIRMITY OF THE ART INAUGURATED BY WAGNER: FOR EXAMPLE, THE VISUAL RESTLESSNESS WHICH REQUIRES ONE CONTINUALLY TO CHANGE ONE‚ÄÔS POSITION. ONE DOESN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND A THING ABOUT WAGNER AS LONG AS ONE FINDS IN HIM MERELY AN ARBITRARY PLAY OF NATURE, A WHIM, AN ACCIDENT. HE WAS NO ‚ÄÚFRAGMENTARY,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚHAPLESS,‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚCONTRADICTORY‚ÄÙ GENIUS, AS PEOPLE HAVE SAID. WAGNER WAS SOMETHING PERFECT, A TYPICAL DECADENT IN WHOM THERE IS NO TRACE OF ‚ÄÚFREE WILL‚ÄÙ AND IN WHOM EVERY FEATURE IS NECESSARY. IF ANYTHING IN WAGNER IS INTERESTING IT IS THE LOGIC WITH WHICH A PHYSIOLOGICAL DEFECT MAKES MOVE UPON MOVE AND TAKES STEP UPON STEP AS PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE, AS INNOVATION IN PRINCIPLES, AS A CRISIS IN TASTE.

FOR THE PRESENT I MERELY DWELL ON THE QUESTION OF STYLE.‚ÄÎWHAT IS THE SIGN OF EVERY LITERARY DECADENCE? THAT LIFE NO LONGER DWELLS IN THE WHOLE. THE WORD BECOMES SOVEREIGN AND LEAPS OUT OF THE SENTENCE, THE SENTENCE REACHES OUT AND OBSCURES THE MEANING OF THE PAGE, THE PAGE GAINS LIFE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE WHOLE‚ÄÎTHE WHOLE IS NO LONGER A WHOLE.2 BUT THIS IS THE SIMILE OF EVERY STYLE OF DECADENCE: EVERY TIME, THE ANARCHY OF ATOMS, DISGREGATION OF THE WILL, ‚ÄÚFREEDOM OF THE INDIVIDUAL,‚ÄÙ TO USE MORAL TERMS‚ÄÎEXPANDED INTO A POLITICAL THEORY, ‚ÄÚEQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL.‚ÄÙ LIFE, EQUAL VITALITY, THE VIBRATION AND EXUBERANCE OF LIFE PUSHED BACK INTO THE SMALLEST FORMS; THE REST, POOR IN LIFE. EVERYWHERE PARALYSIS, ARDUOUSNESS, TORPIDITY OR HOSTILITY AND CHAOS: BOTH MORE AND MORE OBVIOUS THE HIGHER ONE ASCENDS IN FORMS OF ORGANIZATION. THE WHOLE NO LONGER LIVES AT ALL: IT IS COMPOSITE, CALCULATED, ARTIFICIAL, AND ARTIFACT.‚ÄÎ

WAGNER BEGINS FROM A HALLUCINATION‚ÄÎNOT OF SOUNDS BUT OF GESTURES. THEN HE SEEKS THE SIGN LANGUAGE OF SOUNDS FOR THEM. IF ONE WOULD ADMIRE HIM, ONE SHOULD WATCH HIM AT WORK AT THIS POINT: HOW HE SEPARATES, HOW HE GAINS SMALL UNITS, HOW HE ANIMATES THESE, SEVERS THEM, AND MAKES THEM VISIBLE. BUT THIS EXHAUSTS HIS STRENGTH: THE REST IS NO GOOD. HOW WRETCHED, HOW EMBARRASSED, HOW AMATEURISH IS HIS MANNER OF ‚ÄÚDEVELOPMENT,‚ÄÙ HIS ATTEMPT TO AT LEAST INTERLARD WHAT HAS NOT GROWN OUT OF EACH OTHER. HIS MANNERS RECALL THOSE OF THE FR√®RES DE GONCOURT,3 WHO ARE QUITE GENERALLY PERTINENT TO WAGNER‚ÄÔS STYLE: ONE FEELS A KIND OF COMPASSION FOR SO MUCH DISTRESS. THAT WAGNER DISGUISED AS A PRINCIPLE HIS INCAPACITY FOR GIVING ORGANIC FORM, THAT HE ESTABLISHES A ‚ÄÚDRAMATIC STYLE‚ÄÙ WHERE WE MERELY ESTABLISH HIS INCAPACITY FOR ANY STYLE WHATEVER, THIS IS IN LINE WITH A BOLD HABIT THAT ACCOMPANIED WAGNER THROUGH HIS WHOLE LIFE: HE POSITS A PRINCIPLE WHERE HE LACKS A CAPACITY (‚ÄÎVERY DIFFERENT IN THIS RESPECT, INCIDENTALLY, FROM THE OLD KANT WHO PREFERRED ANOTHER BOLDNESS: WHEREVER HE LACKED A PRINCIPLE HE POSITED A SPECIAL HUMAN CAPACITY).4

ONCE MORE: WAGNER IS ADMIRABLE AND GRACIOUS ONLY IN THE INVENTION OF WHAT IS SMALLEST, IN SPINNING OUT THE DETAILS. HERE ONE IS ENTIRELY JUSTIFIED IN PROCLAIMING HIM A MASTER OF THE FIRST RANK, AS OUR GREATEST MINIATURIST IN MUSIC WHO CROWDS INTO THE SMALLEST SPACE AN INFINITY OF SENSE AND SWEETNESS. HIS WEALTH OF COLORS, OF HALF SHADOWS, OF THE SECRECIES OF DYING LIGHT SPOILS ONE TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT AFTERWARD ALMOST ALL OTHER MUSICIANS SEEM TOO ROBUST.

IF ONE WOULD BELIEVE ME ONE SHOULD HAVE TO DERIVE THE HIGHEST CONCEPTION OF WAGNER NOT FROM WHAT IS LIKED ABOUT HIM TODAY. THAT HAS BEEN INVENTED TO PERSUADE THE MASSES; FROM THAT WE RECOIL AS FROM AN ALL TOO IMPUDENT FRESCO.5 OF WHAT CONCERN TO US IS THE AGA√ßANT6 BRUTALITY OF THE TANNH√§USER OVERTURE. OR THE CIRCUS OF WALK√ºRE? WHATEVER OF WAGNER‚ÄÔS MUSIC HAS BECOME POPULAR ALSO APART FROM THE THEATER SHOWS DUBIOUS TASTE AND CORRUPTS TASTE. THE TANNH√§USER MARCH I SUSPECT OF BONHOMMERIE;7 THE OVERTURE OF THE FLYING DUTCHMAN IS NOISE ABOUT NOTHING;8 THE LOHENGRIN PRELUDE FURNISHED THE FIRST EXAMPLE, ONLY TOO INSIDIOUS, ONLY TOO SUCCESSFUL, OF HYPNOTISM BY MEANS OF MUSIC (‚ÄÎI DO NOT LIKE WHATEVER MUSIC HAS NO AMBITION BEYOND PERSUASION OF THE NERVES). BUT QUITE APART FROM THE MAGN√©TISEUR9 AND FRESCO-PAINTER WAGNER, THERE IS ANOTHER WAGNER WHO LAYS ASIDE SMALL GEMS: OUR GREATEST MELANCHOLIAC IN MUSIC, FULL OF GLANCES, TENDERNESSES, AND COMFORTING WORDS IN WHICH NOBODY HAS ANTICIPATED HIM, THE MASTER IN TONES OF A HEAVY-HEARTED AND DROWSY HAPPINESS.

A LEXICON OF WAGNER‚ÄÔS MOST INTIMATE WORDS, ALL OF THEM SHORT THINGS OF FIVE TO FIFTEEN MEASURES, ALL OF IT MUSIC NOBODY KNOWS.‚ÄÎWAGNER HAD THE VIRTUE OF DECADENTS: PITY.





8


‚ÄÚVERY GOOD. BUT HOW CAN ONE LOSE A TASTE FOR THIS DECADENT IF ONE DOES NOT HAPPEN TO BE A MUSICIAN, IF ONE DOES NOT HAPPEN TO BE A DECADENT ONESELF?‚ÄÙ

ON THE CONTRARY, HOW CAN ONE FAIL TO DO IT? JUST TRY IT.‚ÄÎYOU DO NOT KNOW WHO WAGNER IS: A FIRST-RATE ACTOR. IS A MORE PROFOUND, A WEIGHTIER EFFECT TO BE FOUND IN THE THEATER? JUST LOOK AT THESE YOUTHS‚ÄÎRIGID, PALE, BREATHLESS! THESE ARE THE WAGNERIANS: THEY UNDERSTAND NOTHING ABOUT MUSIC‚ÄÎAND YET WAGNER BECOMES MASTER OVER THEM.‚ÄÎWAGNER‚ÄÔS ART HAS THE PRESSURE OF A HUNDRED ATMOSPHERES: STOOP! WHAT ELSE CAN ONE DO?

THE ACTOR WAGNER IS A TYRANT; HIS PATHOS TOPPLES EVERY TASTE, EVERY RESISTANCE.‚ÄÎWHO EQUALS THE PERSUASIVE POWER OF THESE GESTURES? WHO ELSE ENVISAGES GESTURES WITH SUCH ASSURANCE, SO CLEARLY FROM THE START? THE WAY WAGNER‚ÄÔS PATHOS HOLDS ITS BREATH, REFUSES TO LET GO AN EXTREME FEELING, ACHIEVES A TERRIFYING DURATION OF STATES WHEN EVEN A MOMENT THREATENS TO STRANGLE US‚ÄÎ

WAS WAGNER A MUSICIAN AT ALL? AT ANY RATE, THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE THAT HE WAS MORE: NAMELY, AN INCOMPARABLE HISTRIO,1 THE GREATEST MIME, THE MOST AMAZING GENIUS OF THE THEATER EVER AMONG GERMANS, OUR SCENIC ARTIST PAR EXCELLENCE. HE BELONGS ELSEWHERE, NOT IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC: ONE SHOULD NOT CONFUSE HIM WITH THE GENUINE MASTERS OF THAT. WAGNER AND BEETHOVEN‚ÄÎTHAT IS BLASPHEMY AND REALLY WRONGS EVEN WAGNER.‚ÄÎAS A MUSICIAN, TOO, HE WAS ONLY WHAT HE WAS IN GENERAL: HE BECAME A MUSICIAN, HE BECAME A POET BECAUSE THE TYRANT WITHIN HIM, HIS ACTOR‚ÄÔS GENIUS, COMPELLED HIM. ONE CANNOT BEGIN TO FIGURE OUT WAGNER UNTIL ONE FIGURES OUT HIS DOMINANT INSTINCT.

WAGNER WAS NOT A MUSICIAN BY INSTINCT. HE SHOWED THIS BY ABANDONING ALL LAWFULNESS AND, MORE PRECISELY, ALL STYLE IN MUSIC IN ORDER TO TURN IT INTO WHAT HE REQUIRED, THEATRICAL RHETORIC, A MEANS OF EXPRESSION, OF UNDERSCORING GESTURES, OF SUGGESTION, OF THE PSYCHOLOGICALLY PICTURESQUE. HERE WE MAY CONSIDER WAGNER AN INVENTOR AND INNOVATOR OF THE FIRST RANK‚ÄÎHE HAS INCREASED MUSIC‚ÄÔS CAPACITY FOR LANGUAGE TO THE POINT OF MAKING IT IMMEASURABLE: HE IS THE VICTOR HUGO OF MUSIC AS LANGUAGE. ALWAYS PRESUPPOSING THAT ONE FIRST ALLOWS THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES MUSIC MAY BE NOT MUSIC BUT LANGUAGE, INSTRUMENT, ANCILLA2 DRAMATURGICA. WAGNER‚ÄÔS MUSIC, IF NOT SHIELDED BY THEATER TASTE, WHICH IS A VERY TOLERANT TASTE, IS SIMPLY BAD MUSIC, PERHAPS THE WORST EVER MADE. WHEN A MUSICIAN CAN NO LONGER COUNT UP TO THREE HE BECOMES ‚ÄÚDRAMATIC,‚ÄÙ HE BECOMES ‚ÄÚWAGNERIAN.‚ÄÙ

WAGNER ALMOST DISCOVERED HOW MUCH MAGIC IS STILL POSSIBLE WITH MUSIC THAT HAS BEEN DISSOLVED AND, AS IT WERE, MADE ELEMENTARY. HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF THAT IS DOWNRIGHT UNCANNY, NO LESS THAN HIS INSTINCTIVE REALIZATION THAT HE SIMPLY DID NOT REQUIRE THE HIGNER LAWFULNESS, STYLE. WHAT IS ELEMENTARY IS SUFFICIENT‚ÄÎSOUND, MOVEMENT, COLOR, IN BRIEF THE SENSUOUSNESS OF MUSIC. WAGNER NEVER CALCULATES AS A MUSICIAN, FROM SOME SORT OF MUSICIAN‚ÄÔS CONSCIENCE: WHAT HE WANTS IS EFFECT, NOTHING BUT EFFECT. AND HE KNOWS THOSE ON WHOM HE WANTS TO ACHIEVE HIS EFFECTS.‚ÄÎAT THIS POINT HE IS AS FREE FROM QUALMS AS SCHILLER WAS, AS EVERY MAN OF THE THEATER IS, AND HE ALSO HAS THE SAME CONTEMPT FOR THE WORLD WHICH HE PROSTRATES AT HIS FEET.‚ÄÎONE IS AN ACTOR BY VIRTUE OF BEING AHEAD OF THE REST OF MANKIND IN ONE INSIGHT: WHAT IS MEANT TO HAVE THE EFFECT OF TRUTH MUST NOT BE TRUE. THE PROPOSITION WAS FORMULATED BY TALMA;3 IT CONTAINS THE WHOLE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE ACTOR; IT ALSO CONTAINS‚ÄÎWE NEED NOT DOUBT IT‚ÄÎHIS MORALITY. WAGNER‚ÄÔS MUSIC IS NEVER TRUE.

BUT IT IS TAKEN FOR TRUE; AND THUS IT IS IN ORDER.

AS LONG AS WE ARE STILL CHILDLIKE, AND WAGNERIANS AS WELL, WE CONSIDER WAGNER HIMSELF RICH, EVEN AS A PARAGON OF A SQUANDERER, EVEN AS THE OWNER OF HUGE ESTATES IN THE REALM OF SOUND. HE IS ADMIRED FOR WHAT YOUNG FRENCHMEN ADMIRE IN VICTOR HUGO, ‚ÄÚTHE ROYAL LARGESSE.‚ÄÙ LATER ONE COMES TO ADMIRE BOTH OF THEM FOR THE OPPOSITE REASONS: AS MASTERS AND MODELS OF ECONOMY, AS SHREWD HOSTS. NOBODY EQUALS THEIR TALENT FOR PRESENTING A PRINCELY TABLE AT MODEST EXPENSE.

THE WAGNERIAN, WITH HIS BELIEVER‚ÄÔS STOMACH, ACTUALLY FEELS SATED BY THE FARE HIS MASTER‚ÄÔS MAGIC EVOKES FOR HIM. THE REST OF US, DEMANDING SUBSTANCE ABOVE ALL ELSE, IN BOOKS AS WELL AS IN MUSIC, ARE SCARCELY TAKEN CARE OF BY MERELY ‚ÄÚREPRESENTED‚ÄÙ TABLES AND HENCE ARE MUCH WORSE OFF. TO SAY IT PLAINLY: WAGNER DOES NOT GIVE US ENOUGH TO CHEW ON. HIS RECITATIVO‚ÄÎLITTLE MEAT, RATHER MORE BONE, AND A LOT OF BROTH‚ÄÎI HAVE CALLED ‚ÄÚALIA GENOVESE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWITHOUT THE LEAST INTENTION OF FLATTERING THE GENOESE, BUT RATHER THE OLDER RECITATIVO, THE RECITATIVO SECCO.4

FINALLY, AS FAR AS THE WAGNERIAN ‚ÄÚLEITMOTIF‚ÄÙ IS CONCERNED, I LACK ALL CULINARY UNDERSTANDING FOR THAT. IF PRESSED, I MIGHT POSSIBLY CONCEDE IT THE STATUS OF AN IDEAL TOOTHPICK, AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET RID OF REMAINDERS OF FOOD. THERE REMAIN THE ‚ÄÚARIAS‚ÄÙ OF WAGNER.‚ÄÎ AND NOW I SHALL NOT SAY ANOTHER WORD.

IN PROJECTING HIS PLOT, TOO, WAGNER IS ABOVE ALL AN ACTOR. WHAT HE ENVISAGES FIRST IS A SCENE WHOSE EFFECTIVENESS IS ABSOLUTELY SAFE, A GENUINE ACTIO* WITH AN HAUTRELIEF OF GESTURES, A SCENE THAT THROWS PEOPLE‚ÄÎTHIS HE THINKS THROUGH IN DEPTH, AND FROM THIS HE THEN DERIVES THE CHARACTERS. ALL THE REST FOLLOWS FROM THIS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH A TECHNICAL ECONOMY THAT HAS NO REASONS FOR BEING SUBTLE. IT IS NOT THE PUBLIC OF CORNEILLE OF WHOM WAGNER HAS TO BE CONSIDERATE, BUT MERE NINETEENTH CENTURY. ABOUT ‚ÄÚTHE ONE THING NEEDFUL‚ÄÙ WAGNER WOULD THINK APPROXIMATELY THE WAY ANY OTHER ACTOR TODAY THINKS ABOUT IT: A SERIES OF STRONG SCENES, ONE STRONGER THAN THE OTHER‚ÄÎAND IN BETWEEN MUCH SHREWD STUPIDITY. TO BEGIN WITH, HE TRIES TO GUARANTEE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HIS WORK TO HIMSELF; HE STARTS WITH THE THIRD ACT; HE PROVES HIS WORK TO HIMSELF BY MEANS OF ITS ULTIMATE EFFECT. WITH SUCH A SENSE OF THE THEATER FOR ONE‚ÄÔS GUIDE, ONE IS IN NO DANGER OF UNEXPECTEDLY CREATING A DRAMA. DRAMA REQUIRES RIGOROUS LOGIC: BUT WHAT DID WAGNER EVER CARE ABOUT LOGIC? TO SAY IT ONCE MORE: IT WAS NOT THE PUBLIC OF CORNEILLE OF WHOM WAGNER HAD TO BE CONSIDERATE‚ÄÎBUT MERE GERMANS.

WE KNOW WHICH TECHNICAL PROBLEM REQUIRES ALL OF THE DRAMATIST‚ÄÔS POWERS AND OFTEN MAKES HIM SWEAT BLOOD: MAKING THE KNOT NECESSARY, AND THE RESOLUTION AS WELL, SO BOTH WILL BE POSSIBLE IN ONE WAY ONLY WHILE GIVING THE IMPRESSION OF FREEDOM (THE PRINCIPLE OF THE LEAST EXERTION OF ENERGY). THAT, HOWEVER, LEADS WAGNER LEAST OF ALL TO SWEAT BLOOD; IT IS CERTAIN THAT HE EXERTED THE LEAST ENERGY ON THE KNOT AND ITS RESOLUTION. TAKE ANY OF WAGNER‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚKNOTS‚ÄÙ AND EXAMINE IT UNDER THE MICROSCOPE‚ÄÎAND YOU‚ÄÔLL HAVE TO LAUGH, I PROMISE YOU. NOTHING IS MORE AMUSING THAN THE KNOT OF TRISTAN, UNLESS IT IS THE KNOT OF THE MEISTERSINGER.

WAGNER IS NO DRAMATIST; DON‚ÄÔT BE IMPOSED UPON! HE LOVED THE WORD ‚ÄÚDRAMA‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT‚ÄÔS ALL; HE ALWAYS LOVED PRETTY WORDS. THE WORD ‚ÄÚDRAMA‚ÄÙ IN HIS WRITINGS IS NEVERTHELESS A MERE MISUNDERSTANDING (AND A BIT OF SHREWDNESS: WAGNER ALWAYS AFFECTED SUPERIORITY OVER THE WORD ‚ÄÚOPERA‚ÄÙ)‚ÄÎMUCH THE WAY THE WORD ‚ÄÚSPIRIT‚ÄÙ IN THE NEW TESTAMENT IS A MERE MISUNDERSTANDING.

FOR ONE THING, HE WAS NOT ENOUGH OF A PSYCHOLOGIST FOR DRAMA; INSTINCTIVELY, HE AVOIDED PSYCHOLOGICAL MOTIVATION‚ÄÎHOW? BY ALWAYS PUTTING IDIOSYNCRASY IN ITS PLACE.‚ÄÎVERY MODERN, ISN‚ÄÔT IT? VERY PARISIAN. VERY DECADENT.

INCIDENTALLY, THE KNOTS THAT WAGNER REALLY COULD RESOLVE WITH THE AID OF DRAMATIC INVENTIONS WERE OF AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT NATURE. I OFFER AN EXAMPLE. ASSUME A CASE IN WHICH WAGNER REQUIRES A FEMALE VOICE. AN ENTIRE ACT WITHOUT A FEMALE VOICE‚ÄÎIMPOSSIBLE! BUT NONE OF THE ‚ÄÚHEROINES‚ÄÙ ARE FREE AT THE MOMENT. WHAT DOES WAGNER DO? HE EMANCIPATES THE OLDEST WOMAN OF THE WORLD, ERDA: ‚ÄÚCOME UP, OLD GRANDMOTHER! YOU HAVE TO SING.‚ÄÙ ERDA SINGS. WAGNER‚ÄÔS PURPOSE IS REALIZED. IMMEDIATELY HE ABOLISHES THE OLD LADY AGAIN. ‚ÄÚWHY EVER DID YOU COME? BEAT IT. GO ON SLEEPING.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎIN SUMMA: A SCENE FULL OF MYTHOLOGICAL SHIVERS WHICH GIVES WAGNERIANS INTIMATIONS.‚ÄÎ

‚ÄÚBUT THE CONTENT OF THE WAGNERIAN TEXTS! THEIR MYTHIC CONTENT! THEIR ETERNAL CONTENT!‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎQUESTION: HOW CAN WE TEST THIS CONTENT, THIS ETERNAL CONTENT?‚ÄÎTHE CHEMIST REPLIES: TRANSLATE WAGNER INTO REALITY, INTO THE MODERN‚ÄÎLET US BE EVEN CRUELER‚ÄÎINTO THE BOURGEOIS! WHAT BECOMES OF WAGNER THEN?‚ÄÎAMONG OURSELVES, I HAVE TRIED IT. NOTHING IS MORE ENTERTAINING, NOTHING TO BE RECOMMENDED MORE HIGHLY FOR WALKS, THAN RETELLING WAGNER IN MORE YOUTHFUL PROPORTIONS: FOR EXAMPLE, PARSIFAL AS A CANDIDATE FOR A THEOLOGICAL DEGREE, WITH SECONDARY SCHOOL EDUCATION (THE LATTER BEING INDISPENSABLE FOR PURE FOOLISHNESS). WHAT SURPRISES ONE ENCOUNTERS IN THE PROCESS! WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT? ALL OF WAGNER‚ÄÔS HEROINES, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, AS SOON AS THEY ARE STRIPPED OF THEIR HEROIC SKIN, BECOME ALMOST INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM MADAME BOVARY! AND CONVERSELY ONE UNDERSTANDS THAT FLAUBERT COULD HAVE TRANSLATED HIS HEROINE INTO SCANDINAVIAN OR CARTHAGINIAN TERMS AND THEN OFFERED HER, MYTHOLOGIZED, TO WAGNER AS A LIBRETTO. INDEED, TRANSPOSED INTO HUGENESS, WAGNER DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN ANY PROBLEMS EXCEPT THOSE WHICH NOW PREOCCUPY THE LITTLE DECADENTS OF PARIS. ALWAYS FIVE STEPS FROM THE HOSPITAL. ALL OF THEM ENTIRELY MODERN, ENTIRELY METROPOLITAN PROBLEMS. DON‚ÄÔT DOUBT IT.

HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED (IT BELONGS WITH THIS ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS) THAT WAGNER‚ÄÔS HEROINES NEVER HAVE CHILDREN?‚ÄÎTHEY CAN‚ÄÔT.‚ÄÎTHE DESPAIR WITH WHICH WAGNER TACKLED THE PROBLEM OF HAVING SIEGFRIED BORN AT ALL SHOWS HOW MODERN HIS FEELINGS WERE AT THIS POINT.‚ÄÎSIEGFRIED ‚ÄÚEMANCIPATES WOMAN‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎBUT WITHOUT ANY HOPE OF PROGENY.‚ÄÎONE FACT, FINALLY, WHICH LEAVES US DUMFOUNDED: PARSIFAL IS THE FATHER OF LOHENGRIN. HOW DID HE DO IT?‚ÄÎMUST ONE REMEMBER AT THIS POINT THAT ‚ÄÚCHASTITY WORKS MIRACLES?‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎ

WAGNER US DIXIT PRINCEPS IN CASTITATE AUCTORITAS.1





10


INCIDENTALLY, A WORD ABOUT WAGNER‚ÄÔS WRITINGS: THEY OFFER, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A COURSE IN SHREWDNESS. THE SYSTEM OF PROCEDURES THAT WAGNER HANDLES IS APPLICABLE TO A HUNDRED OTHER CASES: LET HIM WHO HAS EARS HEAR. PERHAPS I SHALL BE ENTITLED TO PUBLIC GRATITUDE IF I FORMULATE THE THREE MOST VALUABLE PROCEDURES WITH SOME PRECISION.

EVERYTHING WAGNER CAN NOT DO IS REPREHENSIBLE.

THERE IS MUCH ELSE WAGNER COULD DO: BUT HE DOESN‚ÄÔT WANT TO, FROM RIGORISM IN PRINCIPLE.

EVERYTHING WAGNER CAN DO, NOBODY WILL BE ABLE TO DO AFTER HIM, NOBODY HAS DONE BEFORE HIM, NOBODY SHALL DO AFTER HIM.‚ÄÎWAGNER IS DIVINE.

THESE THREE PROPOSITIONS ARE THE QUINTESSENCE OF WAGNER‚ÄÔS LITERATURE; THE REST IS‚ÄÎMERE ‚ÄÚLITERATURE.‚ÄÙ

NOT EVERY MUSIC SO FAR HAS REQUIRED A LITERATURE: ONE OUGHT TO LOOK FOR A SUFFICIENT REASON HERE. IS IT THAT WAGNER‚ÄÔS MUSIC IS TOO DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND? OR IS HE AFRAID OF THE OPPOSITE, THAT IT MIGHT BE UNDERSTOOD TOO EASILY‚ÄÎTHAT ONE WILL NOT FIND IT DIFFICULT ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND?

AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE REPEATED A SINGLE PROPOSITION ALL HIS LIFE LONG: THAT HIS MUSIC DID NOT MEAN MERE MUSIC. BUT MORE. BUT INFINITELY MORE.‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚNOT MERE MUSIC‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎNO MUSICIAN WOULD SAY THAT. TO SAY IT ONCE MORE, WAGNER WAS UNABLE TO CREATE FROM A TOTALITY; HE HAD NO CHOICE, HE HAD TO MAKE PATCHWORK, ‚ÄÚMOTIFS,‚ÄÙ GESTURES, FORMULAS, DOING THINGS DOUBLE AND EVEN A HUNDREDFOLD‚ÄÎHE REMAINED AN ORATOR EVEN AS A MUSICIAN‚ÄÎHE THEREFORE HAD TO MOVE HIS ‚ÄÚIT MEANS‚ÄÙ INTO THE FOREGROUND AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE. ‚ÄÚMUSIC IS ALWAYS A MERE MEANS‚ÄÙ: THAT WAS HIS THEORY, THAT ABOVE ALL THE ONLY PRACTICE OPEN TO HIM. BUT NO MUSICIAN WOULD THINK THAT WAY.

WAGNER REQUIRED LITERATURE TO PERSUADE ALL THE WORLD TO TAKE HIS MUSIC SERIOUSLY, TO TAKE IT AS PROFOUND ‚ÄÚBECAUSE ITS MEANING WAS INFINITE;‚ÄÙ HE WAS HIS LIFE LONG THE COMMENTATOR OF THE ‚ÄÚIDEA.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWHAT IS THE MEANING OF ELSA? BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT: ELSA IS ‚ÄÚTHE UNCONSCIOUS SPIRIT OF THE PEOPLE‚ÄÙ (‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚREALIZING THIS, I NECESSARILY BECAME A COMPLETE REVOLUTIONARY‚ÄÙ).

LET US REMEMBER THAT WAGNER WAS YOUNG AT THE TIME HEGEL AND SCHELLING SEDUCED MEN‚ÄÔS SPIRITS; THAT HE GUESSED, THAT HE GRASPED WITH HIS VERY HANDS THE ONLY THING THE GERMANS TAKE SERIOUSLY‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚTHE IDEA,‚ÄÙ WHICH IS TO SAY, SOMETHING THAT IS OBSCURE, UNCERTAIN, FULL OF INTIMATIONS; THAT AMONG GERMANS CLARITY IS AN OBJECTION, LOGIC A REFUTATION. HARSHLY, SCHOPENHAUER ACCUSED THE EPOCH OF HEGEL AND SCHELLING OF DISHONESTY‚ÄÎHARSHLY, ALSO WRONGLY: HE HIMSELF, THE OLD PESSIMISTIC COUNTERFEITER,1 WAS NOT A WHIT MORE ‚ÄÚHONEST‚ÄÙ THAN HIS MORE FAMOUS CONTEMPORARIES. LET US KEEP MORALS OUT OF THIS: HEGEL IS A TASTE.‚ÄÎ AND NOT MERELY A GERMAN BUT A EUROPEAN TASTE.‚ÄÎA TASTE WAGNER COMPREHENDED‚ÄÎTO WHICH HE FELT EQUAL‚ÄÎWHICH HE IMMORTALIZED.‚ÄÎHE MERELY APPLIED IT TO MUSIC‚ÄÎHE INVENTED A STYLE FOR HIMSELF CHARGED WITH ‚ÄÚINFINITE MEANING‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHE BECAME THE HEIR OF HEGEL‚ÄÎMUSIC AS ‚ÄÚIDEA.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎ

AND HOW WAGNER WAS UNDERSTOOD!‚ÄÎTHE SAME HUMAN TYPE THAT RAVED ABOUT HEGEL, TODAY RAVES ABOUT WAGNER; IN HIS SCHOOL THEY EVEN WRITE HEGELIAN.‚ÄÎABOVE ALL, GERMAN YOUTHS UNDERSTOOD HIM. THE TWO WORDS ‚ÄÚINFINITE‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚMEANING‚ÄÙ WERE REALLY SUFFICIENT: THEY INDUCED A STATE OF INCOMPARABLE WELL-BEING IN YOUNG MEN. IT WAS NOT WITH HIS MUSIC THAT WAGNER CONQUERED THEM, IT WAS WITH THE ‚ÄÚIDEA‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎIT IS THE ENIGMATIC CHARACTER OF HIS ART, ITS PLAYING HIDE-AND-SEEK BEHIND A HUNDRED SYMBOLS, ITS POLYCHROMY OF THE IDEAL THAT LEADS AND LURES THESE YOUTHS TO WAGNER; IT IS WAGNER‚ÄÔS GENIUS FOR SHAPING CLOUDS, HIS WHIRLING, HURLING, AND TWIRLING THROUGH THE AIR, HIS EVERYWHERE AND NOWHERE‚ÄÎTHE VERY SAME MEANS BY WHICH HEGEL FORMERLY SEDUCED AND LURED THEM!

IN THE MIDST OF WAGNER‚ÄÔS MULTIPLICITY, ABUNDANCE, AND ARBITRARINESS THEY FEEL AS IF JUSTIFIED IN THEIR OWN EYES‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚREDEEMED.‚ÄÙ TREMBLING, THEY HEAR HOW THE GREAT SYMBOLS APPROACH FROM FOGGY DISTANCES TO RESOUND IN HIS ART WITH MUTED THUNDER; THEY ARE NOT IMPATIENT WHEN AT TIMES THINGS ARE GRAY, GRUESOME, AND COLD. AFTER ALL, THEY ARE, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, LIKE WAGNER HIMSELF, RELATED TO SUCH BAD WEATHER, GERMAN WEATHER! WOTAN IS THEIR GOD: BUT WOTAN IS THE GOD OF BAD WEATHER.

THEY ARE QUITE RIGHT, THESE GERMAN YOUTHS, CONSIDERING WHAT THEY ARE LIKE: HOW COULD THEY MISS WHAT WE OTHERS, WE HALCYONS, MISS IN WAGNER‚ÄÎLA GAYA SCIENZA;2 LIGHT FEET, WIT, FIRE, GRACE; THE GREAT LOGIC; THE DANCE OF THE STARS; THE EXUBERANT SPIRITUALITY; THE SOUTHERN SHIVERS OF LIGHT; THE SMOOTH SEA‚ÄÎPERFECTION.‚ÄÎ

I HAVE EXPLAINED WHERE WAGNER BELONGS‚ÄÎNOT IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC. WHAT DOES HE SIGNIFY NEVERTHELESS IN THAT HISTORY? THE EMERGENCE OF THE ACTOR IN MUSIC: A CAPITAL EVENT THAT INVITES THOUGHT, PERHAPS ALSO FEAR. IN A FORMULA: ‚ÄÚWAGNER AND LISZT.‚ÄÙ

NEVER YET HAS THE INTEGRITY OF MUSICIANS, THEIR ‚ÄÚAUTHENTICITY,‚ÄÙ BEEN PUT TO THE TEST SO DANGEROUSLY. ONE CAN GRASP IT WITH ONE‚ÄÔS VERY HANDS: GREAT SUCCESS, SUCCESS WITH THE MASSES NO LONGER SIDES WITH THOSE WHO ARE AUTHENTIC‚ÄÎONE HAS TO BE AN ACTOR TO ACHIEVE THAT.

VICTOR HUGO AND RICHARD WAGNER‚ÄÎTHEY SIGNIFY THE SAME THING: IN DECLINING CULTURES, WHEREVER THE DECISION COMES TO REST WITH THE MASSES, AUTHENTICITY BECOMES SUPERFLUOUS, DISADVANTAGEOUS, A LIABILITY. ONLY THE ACTOR STILL AROUSES GREAT ENTHUSIASM.

THUS THE GOLDEN AGE DAWNS FOR THE ACTOR‚ÄÎFOR HIM AND FOR EVERYTHING RELATED TO HIS KIND. WAGNER MARCHES WITH DRUMS AND PIPES AT THE HEAD OF ALL ARTISTS OF DELIVERY, OF PRESENTATION, OF VIRTUOSITY; THE CONDUCTORS, MACHINISTS, AND STAGE SINGERS WERE THE FIRST HE CONVINCED. NOT TO FORGET THE ORCHESTRA MUSICIANS‚ÄÎTHESE HE ‚ÄÚREDEEMED‚ÄÙ FROM BOREDOM.

THE MOVEMENT WAGNER CREATED EVEN REACHES OVER INTO THE FIELD OF KNOWLEDGE: GRADUALLY, RELEVANT SCIENCES EMERGE FROM CENTURIES OF SCHOLASTICISM. TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE, I SINGLE OUT FOR SPECIAL COMMENDATION THE MERITS OF RIEMANN1 REGARDING RHYTHMICS: HE WAS THE FIRST TO ESTABLISH THE VALIDITY OF THE CENTRAL CONCEPT OF PUNCTUATION FOR MUSIC, TOO (UNFORTUNATELY, HE USED AN UGLY TERM, PHRASIERUNG [PHRASING]).

ALL OF THESE ARE, AS I OWN GRATEFULLY, THE BEST AMONG WAGNER‚ÄÔS ADMIRERS, THOSE MOST DESERVING OF OUR RESPECT‚ÄÎTHEY ARE SIMPLY RIGHT TO ADMIRE WAGNER. THEY SHARE THE SAME INSTINCT, THEY RECOGNIZE IN HIM THE HIGHEST REPRESENTATIVE OF THEIR TYPE, THEY FEEL CHANGED INTO A POWER, EVEN A GREAT POWER, EVER SINCE HE KINDLED THEM WITH HIS OWN ARDOR. FOR HERE, IF ANYWHERE, WAGNER‚ÄÔS INFLUENCE HAS REALLY BEEN BENEFICIAL. NEVER YET HAS SO MUCH BEEN THOUGHT, DESIRED, AND WORKED IN THIS AREA. WAGNER HAS GIVEN ALL OF THESE ARTISTS A NEW CONSCIENCE. WHAT THEY NOW DEMAND OF THEMSELVES, GET FROM THEMSELVES, THEY NEVER DEMANDED OF THEMSELVES BEFORE WAGNER CAME ALONG‚ÄÎFORMERLY, THEY WERE TOO MODEST. A NEW SPIRIT PREVAILS IN THE THEATER SINCE WAGNER‚ÄÔS SPIRIT PREVAILS THERE: ONE DEMANDS WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT, ONE CENSURES SEVERELY, ONE PRAISES RARELY‚ÄÎWHAT IS GOOD, EVEN EXCELLENT, IS CONSIDERED THE RULE. TASTE IS NO LONGER REQUIRED; NOT EVEN A VOICE. WAGNER IS SUNG ONLY WITH A RUINED VOICE: THE EFFECT IS ‚ÄÚDRAMATIC.‚ÄÙ EVEN TALENT IS PRECLUDED. ESPRESSIVO AT ANY COST, AS DEMANDED BY THE WAGNERIAN IDEAL, THE IDEAL OF DECADENCE, DOES NOT GET ALONG WELL WITH TALENT. IT MERELY REQUIRES VIRTUE‚ÄÎMEANING TRAINING, AUTOMATISM, ‚ÄÚSELF-DENIAL.‚ÄÙ NEITHER TASTE, NOR VOICE, NOR TALENT: WAGNER‚ÄÔS STAGE REQUIRES ONE THING ONLY‚ÄÎTEUTONS!‚ÄÎDEFINITION OF THE TEUTON: OBEDIENCE AND LONG LEGS.‚ÄÎ

IT IS FULL OF PROFOUND SIGNIFICANCE THAT THE ARRIVAL OF WAGNER COINCIDES IN TIME WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE ‚ÄÚREICH‚ÄÙ: BOTH EVENTS PROVE THE VERY SAME THING: OBEDIENCE AND LONG LEGS.‚ÄÎNEVER HAS OBEDIENCE BEEN BETTER, NEVER HAS COMMANDING. WAGNERIAN CONDUCTORS IN PARTICULAR ARE WORTHY OF AN AGE THAT POSTERITY WILL CALL ONE DAY, WITH AWED RESPECT, THE CLASSICAL AGE OF WAR, WAGNER UNDERSTOOD HOW TO COMMAND; IN THIS, TOO, HE WAS THE GREAT TEACHER. HE COMMANDED AS THE INEXORABLE WILL TO HIMSELF, AS LIFELONG SELF-DISCIPLINE: WAGNER WHO FURNISHES PERHAPS THE GREATEST EXAMPLE OF SELF-VIOLATION IN THE HISTORY OF ART (‚ÄÎEVEN ALFIERI,2 OTHERWISE HIS CLOSEST RELATIVE, STANDS SURPASSED. NOTE BY A TURINESE).

THE INSIGHT THAT OUR ACTORS ARE MORE DESERVING OF ADMIRATION THAN EVER DOES NOT IMPLY THAT THEY ARE ANY LESS DANGEROUS.‚ÄÎBUT WHO COULD STILL DOUBT WHAT I WANT‚ÄÎWHAT ARE THE THREE DEMANDS FOR WHICH MY WRATH, MY CONCERN, MY LOVE OF ART HAS THIS TIME OPENED MY MOUTH?

THAT THE THEATER SHOULD NOT LORD IT OVER THE ARTS.

THAT THE ACTOR SHOULD NOT SEDUCE THOSE WHO ARE AUTHENTIC.

THAT MUSIC SHOULD NOT BECOME AN ART OF LYING.

* [NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS] NOTE. IT HAS BEEN A REAL MISFORTUNE FOR AESTHETICS THAT THE WORD DRAMA HAS ALWAYS BEEN TRANSLATED ‚ÄÚACTION‚ÄÙ [HANDLUNG]. IT IS NOT WAGNER ALONE WHO ERRS AT THIS POINT, THE ERROR IS WORLD-WIDE AND EXTENDS EVEN TO THE PHILOLOGISTS WHO OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER. ANCIENT DRAMA AIMED AT SCENES OF GREAT PATHOS‚ÄÎIT PRECLUDED ACTION (MOVING IT BEFORE THE BEGINNING OR BEHIND THE SCENE). THE WORD DRAMA IS OF DORIC ORIGIN, AND ACCORDING TO DORIC USAGE IT MEANS ‚ÄÚEVENT,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚSTORY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎBOTH WORDS IN THE HIERATIC SENSE. THE MOST ANCIENT DRAMA REPRESENTED THE LEGEND OF THE PLACE, THE ‚ÄÚHOLY STORY‚ÄÙ ON WHICH THE FOUNDATION OF THE CULT RESTED (NOT A DOING BUT A HAPPENING: DRAN IN DORIC ACTUALLY DOES NOT MEAN ‚ÄÚDO‚ÄÙ).

POSTSCRIPT


THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE LAST WORDS PERMITS ME TO PUBLISH AT THIS POINT A FEW SENTENCES FROM AN AS YET UNPRINTED ESSAY. AT LEAST THEY SHOULD LEAVE NO ROOM FOR DOUBT ABOUT MY SERIOUSNESS IN THIS MATTER. THIS ESSAY BEARS THE TITLE: THE PRICE WE ARE PAYING FOR WAGNER.

ONE PAYS HEAVILY FOR BEING ONE OF WAGNER‚ÄÔS DISCIPLES. AN OBSCURE RECOGNITION OF THIS FACT IS STILL ENCOUNTERED EVEN TODAY. WAGNER‚ÄÔS SUCCESS, HIS TRIUMPH, HAS NOT ERADICATED IT. BUT FORMERLY IT WAS STRONG, IT WAS TERRIBLE, IT WAS LIKE A DARK HATRED‚ÄÎTHROUGH ALMOST THREE QUARTERS OF WAGNER‚ÄÔS LIFE. THE RESISTANCE HE ENCOUNTERED AMONG US GERMANS CANNOT BE ESTEEMED TOO HIGHLY OR HONORED TOO MUCH. HE WAS RESISTED LIKE A SICKNESS‚ÄÎNOT WITH REASONS‚ÄÎONE DOES NOT REFUTE A SICKNESS‚ÄÎBUT WITH INHIBITION, MISTRUST, VEXATION, AND DISGUST, WITH A GLOOMY SERIOUSNESS, AS IF HE REPRESENTED SOME GREAT CREEPING DANGER. OUR HONORED AESTHETICIANS HAVE COMPROMISED THEMSELVES WHEN, COMING FROM THREE SCHOOLS OF GERMAN PHILOSOPHY, THEY WAGED AN ABSURD WAR AGAINST WAGNER‚ÄÔS PRINCIPLES WITH ‚ÄÚIF‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚFOR‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAS IF HE CARED ABOUT PRINCIPLES, EVEN HIS OWN!

THE GERMANS THEMSELVES HAD REASON ENOUGH IN THEIR INSTINCTS TO RULE OUT ANY ‚ÄÚIF‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚFOR.‚ÄÙ AN INSTINCT IS WEAKENED WHEN IT RATIONALIZES ITSELF: FOR BY RATIONALIZING ITSELF IT WEAKENS ITSELF. IF THERE ARE ANY SIGNS THAT, IN SPITE OF THE TOTAL CHARACTER OF EUROPEAN DECADENCE, THE GERMAN CHARACTER STILL POSSESSES SOME DEGREE OF HEALTH, SOME INSTINCTIVE SENSE FOR WHAT IS HARMFUL AND DANGEROUS, THIS DIM RESISTANCE TO WAGNER IS THE SIGN I SHOULD LIKE LEAST TO SEE UNDERESTIMATED. IT DOES US HONOR, IT EVEN PERMITS A HOPE: FRANCE WOULD NOT HAVE THAT MUCH HEALTH ANY MORE. THE GERMANS, THE DELAYERS PAR EXCELLENCE IN HISTORY, ARE TODAY THE MOST RETARDED CIVILIZED NATION IN EUROPE:1 THIS HAS ITS ADVANTAGES‚ÄÎBY THE SAME TOKEN THEY ARE RELATIVELY THE YOUNGEST.

ONE PAYS HEAVILY FOR BEING ONE OF WAGNER‚ÄÔS DISCIPLES. ONLY QUITE RECENTLY HAVE THE GERMANS SHED A KIND OF FEAR OF HIM‚ÄÎTHE ITCH TO BE RID OF HIM THEY FELT AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY.*

IT IS A CURIOUS MATTER, STILL REMEMBERED, WHICH REVEALED THIS OLD FEELING ONCE MORE AT THE VERY END, QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY. IT HAPPENED AT WAGNER‚ÄÔS FUNERAL: THE FIRST GERMAN WAGNER ASSOCIATION, THAT OF MUNICH, PLACED A WREATH ON HIS GRAVE, WITH AN INSCRIPTION THAT IMMEDIATELY BECAME FAMOUS. IT READ: ‚ÄÚREDEMPTION FOR THE REDEEMER!‚ÄÙ EVERYBODY ADMIRED THE LOFTY INSPIRATION THAT HAD DICTATED THIS INSCRIPTION; ALSO THE TASTE THAT DISTINGUISHED WAGNER‚ÄÔS ADMIRERS. BUT MANY (STRANGELY ENOUGH!) MADE THE SAME SMALL CORRECTION: ‚ÄÚREDEMPTION FROM THE REDEEMER!‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎONE HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF.‚ÄÎ

ONE PAYS HEAVILY FOR BEING ONE OF WAGNER‚ÄÔS DISCIPLES. LET US TAKE THE MEASURE OF THIS DISCIPLESHIP BY CONSIDERING ITS CULTURAL EFFECTS. WHOM DID HIS MOVEMENT BRING TO THE FORE? WHAT DID IT BREED AND MULTIPLY?‚ÄÎABOVE ALL, THE PRESUMPTION OF THE LAYMAN, THE ART-IDIOT. THAT KIND NOW ORGANIZES ASSOCIATIONS, WANTS ITS ‚ÄÚTASTE‚ÄÙ TO PREVAIL, WANTS TO PLAY THE JUDGE EVEN IN REBUS MUSICIS ET MUSICANTIBUS.2 SECONDLY: AN EVER GROWING INDIFFERENCE AGAINST ALL SEVERE, NOBLE, CONSCIENTIOUS TRAINING IN THE SERVICE OF ART; ALL THIS IS TO BE REPLACED BY FAITH IN GENIUS OR, TO SPEAK PLAINLY, BY IMPUDENT DILETTANTISM (‚ÄÎTHE FORMULA FOR THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE MEISTERSINGER). THIRDLY AND WORST OF ALL: THEATROCRACY‚ÄÎTHE NONSENSE OF A FAITH IN THE PRECEDENCE OF THE THEATER, IN THE RIGHT OF THE THEATER TO LORD IT OVER THE ARTS, OVER ART.‚ÄÎ

BUT ONE SHOULD TELL THE WAGNERIANS A HUNDRED TIMES TO THEIR FACES WHAT THE THEATER IS: ALWAYS ONLY BENEATH ART, ALWAYS ONLY SOMETHING SECONDARY, SOMETHING MADE CRUDER, SOMETHING TWISTED TENDENTIOUSLY, MENDACIOUSLY, FOR THE SAKE OF THE MASSES. WAGNER, TOO, DID NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THIS RESPECT: BAYREUTH IS LARGE-SCALE OPERA;‚ÄÎAND NOT EVEN GOOD OPERA.‚ÄÎTHE THEATER IS A FORM OF DEMOLATRY3 IN MATTERS OF TASTE; THE THEATER IS A REVOLT OF THE MASSES,4 A PLEBISCITE AGAINST GOOD TASTE.‚ÄÎTHIS IS PRECISELY WHAT IS PROVED BY THE CASE OF WAGNER: HE WON THE CROWD, HE CORRUPTED TASTE, HE SPOILED EVEN OUR TASTE FOR OPERA!‚ÄÎ5

ONE PAYS HEAVILY FOR BEING ONE OF WAGNER‚ÄÔS DISCIPLES. WHAT DOES IT DO TO THE SPIRIT? DOES WAGNER LIBERATE THE SPIRIT?‚ÄÎHE IS DISTINGUISHED BY EVERY AMBIGUITY, EVERY DOUBLE SENSE, EVERYTHING QUITE GENERALLY THAT PERSUADES THOSE WHO ARE UNCERTAIN WITHOUT MAKING THEM AWARE OF WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN PERSUADED. THUS WAGNER IS A SEDUCER ON A LARGE SCALE. THERE IS NOTHING WEARY, NOTHING DECREPIT, NOTHING FATAL AND HOSTILE TO LIFE IN MATTERS OF THE SPIRIT THAT HIS ART DOES NOT SECRETLY SAFEGUARD: IT IS THE BLACKEST OBSCURANTISM THAT HE CONCEALS IN THE IDEAL‚ÄÔS SHROUDS OF LIGHT. HE FLATTERS EVERY NIHILISTIC (BUDDHISTIC) INSTINCT AND DISGUISES IT IN MUSIC; HE FLATTERS EVERYTHING CHRISTIAN, EVERY RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION OF DECADENCE. OPEN YOUR EARS: EVERYTHING THAT EVER GREW ON THE SOIL OF IMPOVERISHED LIFE, ALL OF THE COUNTERFEITING OF TRANSCENDENCE AND BEYOND,6 HAS FOUND ITS MOST SUBLIME ADVOCATE IN WAGNER‚ÄÔS ART‚ÄÎNOT BY MEANS OF FORMULAS: WAGNER IS TOO SHREWD FOR FORMULAS‚ÄÎBUT BY MEANS OF A PERSUASION OF SENSUOUSNESS WHICH IN TURN MAKES THE SPIRIT WEARY AND WORN-OUT. MUSIC AS CIRCE.

HIS LAST WORK IS IN THIS RESPECT HIS GREATEST MASTERPIECE. IN THE ART OF SEDUCTION, PARSIFAL WILL ALWAYS RETAIN ITS RANK‚ÄÎAS THE STROKE OF GENIUS IN SEDUCTION.‚ÄÎI ADMIRE THIS WORK; I WISH I HAD WRITTEN IT MYSELF; FAILING THAT, I UNDERSTAND IT,‚ÄÎWAGNER NEVER HAD BETTER INSPIRATIONS THAN IN THE END. HERE THE CUNNING IN HIS ALLIANCE OF BEAUTY AND SICKNESS GOES SO FAR THAT, AS IT WERE, IT CASTS A SHADOW OVER WAGNER‚ÄÔS EARLIER ART‚ÄÎWHICH NOW SEEMS TOO BRIGHT, TOO HEALTHY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS? HEALTH, BRIGHTNESS HAVING THE EFFECT OF A SHADOW? ALMOST OF AN OBJECTION?‚ÄÎTO SUCH AN EXTENT HAVE WE BECOME PURE FOOLS,‚ÄÎNEVER WAS THERE A GREATER MASTER IN DIM, HIERATIC AROMAS‚ÄÎNEVER WAS THERE A MAN EQUALLY EXPERT IN ALL SMALL INFINITIES, ALL THAT TREMBLES AND IS EFFUSIVE, ALL THE FEMINISMS FROM THE IDIOTICON7 OF HAPPINESS!‚ÄÎDRINK, O MY FRIENDS, THE PHILTERS OF THIS ART! NOWHERE WILL YOU FIND A MORE AGREEABLE WAY OF ENERVATING YOUR SPIRIT, OF FORGETTING YOUR MANHOOD UNDER A ROSEBUSH.‚ÄÎAH, THIS OLD MAGICIAN! THIS KLINGSOR8 OF ALL KLINGSORS! HOW HE THUS WAGES WAR AGAINST US! US, THE FREE SPIRITS! HOW HE INDULGES EVERY COWARDICE OF THE MODERN SOUL WITH THE TONES OF MAGIC MAIDENS!‚ÄÎNEVER BEFORE HAS THERE BEEN SUCH A DEADLY HATRED OF THE SEARCH FOR KNOWLEDGE!‚ÄÎONE HAS TO BE A CYNIC IN ORDER NOT TO BE SEDUCED HERE; ONE HAS TO BE ABLE TO BITE IN ORDER NOT TO WORSHIP HERE. WELL THEN, YOU OLD SEDUCER, THE CYNIC WARNS YOU‚ÄÎCAVE CANEM.‚ÄÎ9

ONE PAYS HEAVILY FOR BEING ONE OF WAGNER‚ÄÔS DISCIPLES. I OBSERVE THOSE YOUTHS WHO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO HIS INFECTION FOR A LONG TIME. THE FIRST, RELATIVELY INNOCENT EFFECT IS THE CORRUPTION OF TASTE. WAGNER HAS THE SAME EFFECT AS CONTINUAL CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL: BLUNTING, AND OBSTRUCTING THE STOMACH WITH PHLEGM. SPECIFIC EFFECT: DEGENERATION OF THE SENSE OF RHYTHM. IN THE END THE WAGNERIAN CALLS RHYTHMIC WHAT I MYSELF CALL, USING A GREEK PROVERB, ‚ÄÚMOVING THE SWAMPS.‚ÄÙ CONSIDERABLY MORE DANGEROUS IS THE CORRUPTION OF CONCEPTS. THE YOUTH BECOMES A MOON-CALF‚ÄÎAN ‚ÄÚIDEALIST.‚ÄÙ HE HAS GONE BEYOND SCIENCE; IN THIS WAY HE HAS REACHED THE MASTER‚ÄÔS LEVEL. AND HE POSES AS A PHILOSOPHER; HE WRITES BAYREUTHER BL√§TTER;10 HE SOLVES ALL PROBLEMS IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE HOLY MASTER.11 WHAT IS UNCANNIEST, HOWEVER, IS THE CORRUPTION OF THE NERVES. LET ANYONE WALK THROUGH A CITY: EVERYWHERE HE WILL HEAR HOW INSTRUMENTS ARE RAVISHED IN A SOLEMN RAGE‚ÄÎINTERSPERSED WITH A SAVAGE HOWLING. WHAT‚ÄÔS GOING ON?‚ÄÎTHE YOUTHS ARE WORSHIPING WAGNER.‚ÄÎBAYREUTH RHYMES ON INSTITUTE FOR COLD-WATER THERAPY.12‚ÄÎTYPICAL TELEGRAM FROM BAYREUTH: BEREITS BEREUT [ALREADY RUED].‚ÄÎ

WAGNER IS BAD FOR YOUTHS; HE IS CALAMITOUS FOR WOMEN. WHAT IS A FEMALE WAGNERIAN, MEDICALLY SPEAKING?‚ÄÎIT SEEMS TO ME, A DOCTOR CAN‚ÄÔT CONFRONT YOUNG WOMEN TOO SERIOUSLY WITH THIS ALTERNATIVE FOR THE CONSCIENCE: ONE OR THE OTHER.‚ÄÎBUT THEY HAVE ALREADY MADE THEIR CHOICE. ONE CANNOT SERVE TWO MASTERS WHEN THE NAME OF ONE IS WAGNER. WAGNER HAS REDEEMED WOMAN; IN RETURN, WOMAN HAS BUILT BAYREUTH FOR HIM. ALL SACRIFICE, ALL DEVOTION: ONE HAS NOTHING THAT ONE WOULD NOT GIVE TO HIM. WOMAN IMPOVERISHES HERSELF FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE MASTER, SHE BECOMES TOUCHING, SHE STANDS NAKED BEFORE HIM.‚ÄÎTHE FEMALE WAGNERIAN‚ÄÎTHE MOST CHARMING AMBIGUITY THAT EXISTS TODAY; SHE EMBODIES THE CAUSE OF WAGNER‚ÄÎIN HER SIGN HIS CAUSE TRIUMPHS.‚ÄÎAH, THIS OLD ROBBER! HE ROBS OUR YOUTHS, HE EVEN ROBS OUR WOMEN AND DRAGS THEM INTO HIS DEN.‚ÄÎAH, THIS OLD MINOTAUR! THE PRICE WE HAVE HAD TO PAY FOR HIM! EVERY YEAR TRAINS OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MAIDENS AND YOUTHS ARE LED INTO HIS LABYRINTH, SO THAT HE MAY DEVOUR THEM‚ÄÎEVERY YEAR ALL OF EUROPE INTONES THE WORDS, ‚ÄÚOFF TO CRETE! OFF TO CRETE!‚ÄÙ13

SECOND POSTSCRIPT

MY LETTER, IT SEEMS, IS OPEN TO A MISUNDERSTANDING. ON CERTAIN FACES THE LINES OF GRATITUDE APPEAR; I EVEN HEAR A MODEST EXULTATION. I SHOULD PREFER TO BE UNDERSTOOD IN THIS MATTER‚ÄÎAS IN MANY OTHERS.‚ÄÎBUT SINCE A NEW ANIMAL PLAYS HAVOC IN THE VINEYARDS OF THE GERMAN SPIRIT, THE REICH-WORM, THE FAMOUS RHINOXERA,1 NOT A WORD I WRITE IS UNDERSTOOD ANY MORE. EVEN THE KREUZZEITUNG2 TESTIFIES TO THAT, NOT TO SPEAK OF THE LITERARISCHE ZENTRALBLATT.3‚ÄÎI HAVE GIVEN THE GERMANS THE MOST PROFOUND BOOKS THEY HAVE‚ÄÎREASON ENOUGH FOR THE GERMANS NOT TO UNDERSTAND A SINGLE WORD.‚ÄÎ

WHEN IN THIS ESSAY I DECLARE WAR UPON WAGNER‚ÄÎAND INCIDENTALLY UPON A GERMAN ‚ÄÚTASTE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWHEN I USE HARSH WORDS AGAINST THE CRETINISM OF BAYREUTH, THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS START A CELEBRATION FOR ANY OTHER MUSICIANS. OTHER MUSICIANS DON‚ÄÔT COUNT COMPARED TO WAGNER. THINGS ARE BAD GENERALLY. DECAY IS UNIVERSAL. THE SICKNESS GOES DEEP. IF WAGNER NEVERTHELESS GIVES HIS NAME TO THE RUIN OF MUSIC, AS BERNINI DID TO THE RUIN OF SCULPTURE, HE IS CERTAINLY NOT ITS CAUSE. HE MERELY ACCELERATED ITS TEMPO‚ÄÎTO BE SURE, IN SUCH A MANNER THAT ONE STANDS HORRIFIED BEFORE THIS ALMOST SUDDEN DOWNWARD MOTION, ABYSS-WARD. HE HAD THE NA√ØVET√© OF DECADENCE: THIS WAS HIS SUPERIORITY. HE BELIEVED IN IT, HE DID NOT STOP BEFORE ANY OF THE LOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF DECADENCE. THE OTHERS HESITATE‚ÄÎTHAT IS WHAT DIFFERENTIATES THEM. NOTHING ELSE.

WHAT WAGNER HAS IN COMMON WITH ‚ÄÚTHE OTHERS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎI‚ÄÔLL ENUMERATE IT: THE DECLINE OF THE POWER TO ORGANIZE; THE MISUSE OF TRADITIONAL MEANS WITHOUT THE CAPACITY TO FURNISH ANY JUSTIFICATION, ANY FOR-THE-SAKE-OF; THE COUNTERFEITING4 IN THE IMITATION OF BIG FORMS FOR WHICH NOBODY TODAY IS STRONG, PROUD, SELF-ASSURED, HEALTHY ENOUGH; EXCESSIVE LIVELINESS IN THE SMALLEST PARTS; EXCITEMENT AT ANY PRICE; CUNNING AS THE EXPRESSION OF IMPOVERISHED LIFE; MORE AND MORE NERVES IN PLACE OF FLESH.‚ÄÎI KNOW ONLY ONE MUSICIAN WHO IS STILL CAPABLE TODAY OF CREATING AN OVERTURE THAT IS OF ONE PIECE: AND NOBODY KNOWS HIM.5

THOSE FAMOUS TODAY DO NOT WRITE ‚ÄÚBETTER‚ÄÙ MUSIC THAN WAGNER BUT MERELY LESS DECISIVE MUSIC, MORE INDIFFERENT MUSIC‚ÄÎMORE INDIFFERENT BECAUSE WHAT IS MERELY HALF IS DATED BY THE PRESENCE OF WHAT IS WHOLE. BUT WAGNER WAS WHOLE; BUT WAGNER WAS THE WHOLE CORRUPTION; BUT WAGNER WAS COURAGE, THE WILL, CONVICTION IN CORRUPTION‚ÄÎWHAT DOES JOHANNES BRAHMS MATTER NOW?‚ÄÎHIS GOOD FORTUNE WAS A GERMAN MISUNDERSTANDING: HE WAS TAKEN FOR WAGNER‚ÄÔS ANTAGONIST‚ÄÎAN ANTAGONIST WAS NEEDED.‚ÄÎTHAT DOES NOT MAKE FOR NECESSARY MUSIC, THAT MAKES, ABOVE ALL, FOR TOO MUCH MUSIC.‚ÄÎIF ONE IS NOT RICH ONE SHOULD HAVE PRIDE ENOUGH FOR POVERTY.

THE SYMPATHY BRAHMS INSPIRES UNDENIABLY AT CERTAIN POINTS, QUITE ASIDE FROM THIS PARTY INTEREST, PARTY MISUNDERSTANDING, LONG SEEMED ENIGMATIC TO ME‚ÄÎUNTIL FINALLY I DISCOVERED, ALMOST BY ACCIDENT, THAT HE AFFECTS A CERTAIN TYPE OF MAN. HIS IS THE MELANCHOLY OF INCAPACITY; HE DOES NOT CREATE OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE, HE LANGUISHES FOR ABUNDANCE. IF WE DISCOUNT WHAT HE IMITATES, WHAT HE BORROWS FROM GREAT OLD OR EXOTIC-MODERN STYLES‚ÄÎHE IS A MASTER OF IMITATION‚ÄÎWHAT REMAINS AS SPECIFICALLY HIS IS YEARNING.‚ÄÎTHIS IS FELT BY ALL WHO ARE FULL OF YEARNING AND DISSATISFACTION OF ANY KIND. HE IS TOO LITTLE A PERSON, TOO LITTLE A CENTER.‚ÄÎTHIS IS UNDERSTOOD BY THOSE WHO ARE ‚ÄÚIMPERSONAL,‚ÄÙ THOSE ON THE PERIPHERY‚ÄÎAND THEY LOVE HIM FOR THAT. IN PARTICULAR, HE IS THE MUSICIAN FOR A CERTAIN TYPE OF DISSATISFIED WOMEN. FIFTY STEPS MORE, AND YOU HAVE GOT THE FEMALE WAGNERIAN‚ÄÎJUST AS FIFTY STEPS BEYOND BRAHMS YOU ENCOUNTER WAGNER‚ÄÎTHE FEMALE WAGNERIAN, A TYPE THAT IS MORE INCISIVE, MORE INTERESTING, AND ABOVE ALL MORE CHARMING. BRAHMS IS TOUCHING AS LONG AS HE IS SECRETLY ENRAPTURED OR MOURNS FOR HIMSELF‚ÄÎIN THIS HE IS ‚ÄÚMODERN;‚ÄÙ HE BECOMES COLD AND OF NO FURTHER CONCERN TO US AS SOON AS HE BECOMES THE HEIR OF THE CLASSICAL COMPOSERS.‚ÄÎPEOPLE LIKE TO CALL BRAHMS THE HEIR OF BEETHOVEN: I KNOW NO MORE CAUTIOUS EUPHEMISM.‚ÄÎ

EVERYTHING IN MUSIC TODAY THAT LAYS CLAIM TO A ‚ÄÚGREAT STYLE‚ÄÙ EITHER DECEIVES US OR DECEIVES ITSELF. THIS ALTERNATIVE GIVES ENOUGH FOOD FOR THOUGHT; FOR IT INCLUDES SOME CASUISTRY ABOUT THE VALUE OF THESE TWO CASES. ‚ÄÚDECEIVES US‚ÄÙ: MOST PEOPLE‚ÄÔS INSTINCT PROTESTS AGAINST THIS‚ÄÎTHEY DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO BE DECEIVED‚ÄÎBUT I MYSELF SHOULD STILL PREFER EVEN THIS TYPE TO THE OTHER (‚ÄÚDECEIVES ITSELF‚ÄÙ). THIS IS MY TASTE.‚ÄÎ

TO MAKE THIS EASIER TO UNDERSTAND, FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE ‚ÄÚPOOR IN SPIRIT‚ÄÙ: BRAHMS‚ÄÎOR WAGNER.‚ÄÎBRAHMS IS NO ACTOR.‚ÄÎA GOODLY PORTION OF THE OTHER MUSICIANS MAY BE SUBSUMED IN THE CONCEPT OF BRAHMS.‚ÄÎ

I WASTE NO WORDS ON THE CLEVER APES OF WAGNER, GOLDMARK, FOR EXAMPLE: WITH THE QUEEN OF SHEBA6 ONE BELONGS IN A ZOO‚ÄÎONE CAN MAKE AN EXHIBIT OF ONESELF.‚ÄÎWHAT CAN BE DONE WELL TODAY, WHAT CAN BE MASTERLY, IS ONLY WHAT IS SMALL. HERE ALONE INTEGRITY IS STILL POSSIBLE.‚ÄÎ

NOTHING, HOWEVER, CAN CURE MUSIC IN WHAT COUNTS, FROM WHAT COUNTS, FROM THE FATALITY OF BEING AN EXPRESSION OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CONTRADICTION‚ÄÎOF BEING MODERN. THE BEST INSTRUCTION, THE MOST CONSCIENTIOUS TRAINING, INTIMACY ON PRINCIPLE, EVEN ISOLATION IN THE COMPANY OF THE OLD MASTERS‚ÄÎALL THIS REMAINS MERELY PALLIATIVE‚ÄÎTO SPEAK MORE PRECISELY, ILLUSORY‚ÄÎFOR ONE NO LONGER HAS THE PRESUPPOSITION IN ONE‚ÄÔS BODY, WHETHER THIS BE THE STRONG RACE OF A HANDEL OR WHETHER IT BE THE OVERFLOWING ANIMAL VITALITY OF A ROSSINI.‚ÄÎNOT EVERYBODY HAS A RIGHT TO EVERY TEACHER: THAT APPLIES TO WHOLE AGES.‚ÄÎ

TO BE SURE, THE POSSIBILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED THAT SOMEWHERE IN EUROPE THERE ARE STILL REMNANTS OF STRONGER GENERATIONS, OF TYPICALLY UNTIMELY HUMAN BEINGS: IF SO, ONE COULD STILL HOPE FOR A BELATED BEAUTY AND PERFECTION IN MUSIC, TOO, FROM THAT QUARTER. WHAT WE CAN STILL EXPERIENCE AT BEST ARE EXCEPTIONS. FROM THE RULE THAT CORRUPTION IS ON TOP, THAT CORRUPTION IS FATALISTIC, NO GOD CAN SAVE MUSIC.

* [NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS] NOTE. WAS WAGNER A GERMAN AT ALL? THERE ARE SOME REASONS FOR THIS QUESTION. IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND ANY GERMAN TRAIT IN HIM. BEING A GREAT LEARNER, HE LEARNED TO IMITATE MUCH THAT WAS GERMAN‚ÄÎTHAT‚ÄÔS ALL. HIS OWN NATURE CONTRADICTS THAT WHICH HAS HITHERTO BEEN FELT TO BE GERMAN‚ÄÎNOT TO SPEAK OF A GERMAN MUSICIAN.‚ÄÎHIS FATHER WAS AN ACTOR BY THE NAME OF GEYER. A GEYER [VULTURE] IS PRACTICALLY AN ADLER [EAGLE].‚ÄÎWHAT HAS HITHERTO CIRCULATED AS ‚ÄÚWAGNER‚ÄÔS LIFE‚ÄÙ IS FABLE CONVENUE [A MYTH THAT HAS GAINED ACCEPTANCE], IF NOT WORSE. I CONFESS MY MISTRUST OF EVERY POINT ATTESTED TO ONLY BY WAGNER HIMSELF. HE DID NOT HAVE PRIDE ENOUGH FOR ANY TRUTH ABOUT HIMSELF; NOBODY WAS LESS PROUD. ENTIRELY LIKE VICTOR HUGO, HE REMAINED FAITHFUL TO HIMSELF IN BIOGRAPHICAL QUESTIONS, TOO‚ÄÎHE REMAINED AN ACTOR. [SEE THE LETTERS OF AUGUST 1888, PRINTED BELOW. W. K.]

4EIN MASSEN-AUFSTAND: THE PHRASE IS HERE INTRODUCED IN THE VERY SAME SENSE IN WHICH ORTEGA Y GASSET (1883‚ÄÌ1955) GAVE IT WORLD-WIDE CURRENCY WHEN HE MADE IT THE TITLE OF HIS BEST KNOWN BOOK IN 1930. NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS INFLUENCE ON ORETGA WAS VERY GREAT.

IF VERDARB WERE TAKEN TO MEAN ‚ÄÚCORRUPTED‚ÄÙ IN BOTH PLACES, THE MEANING OF THE SECOND PART OF THE SENTENCE WOULD BE PUZZLING: ‚ÄÚHE CORRUPTED OUR TASTE EVEN FOR OPERA.‚ÄÙ WHY ‚ÄÚEVEN FOR OPERA‚ÄÙ? ONE WOULD EXPECT NIETZSCHE TO SAY THAT WAGNER CORRUPTED NOT ONLY MUSICAL TASTE, AND TASTE FOR OPERA ABOVE ALL, BUT ALSO TASTE IN GENERAL. SO NIETZSCHE PRESUMABLY MEANS: HE CORRUPTED TASTE AND SPOILED EVEN OUR TASTE FOR OPERA.

1NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS COINAGE. NO PREVIOUS GERMAN OR ENGLISH EDITION ATTEMPTS AN EXPLANATION. THE SIMILARITY OF THE WORD TO ‚ÄÚRHINOCEROS‚ÄÙ MAKES THE NAME SOUND LIKE THAT OF A REAL ANIMAL; BUT GREEK RHINOS, WHICH CAN EITHER MEAN SKIN OR BE THE GENITIVE OF RHIS (NOSE), DOES NOT SEEM RELEVANT. DOUGLAS E. WILSON HAS CALLED MY ATTENTION TO PHYLLOXERA, THE PLANT LICE THAT ATTACK EUROPEAN GRAPE VINES, AND I HAVE FOUND THAT IN 1881 THERE ACTUALLY WAS AN INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ABOUT MEANS TO COMBAT THIS VINE PEST. NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS RHINOXERA MIGHT THUS BE TRANSLATED RHINEPEST. THE RHINE IS A SYMBOL OF GERMAN NATIONALISM AND CENTRAL IN WAGNER‚ÄÔS RING.

NONE OF THIS SHOULD BE TAKEN TOO SERIOUSLY, ANY MORE THAN SIMILAR COINAGES IN ZARATHUSTRA. BUT IT HELPS TO EXPLAIN WHY CHRISTIAN MORGENSTERN (1871‚ÄÌ1914) PLACED A MOTTO FROM NIETZSCHE AT THE HEAD OF HIS DELIGHTFUL GALGENLIEDER (GALLOW SONGS: THREE ARE INCLUDED IN TWENTY GERMAN POETS: A BILINGUAL EDITION, ED.

EPILOGUE


LET US RECOVER OUR BREATH IN THE END BY GETTING AWAY FOR A MOMENT FROM THE NARROW WORLD TO WHICH EVERY QUESTION ABOUT THE WORTH OF PERSONS CONDEMNS THE SPIRIT. A PHILOSOPHER FEELS THE NEED TO WASH HIS HANDS AFTER HAVING DEALT SO LONG WITH ‚ÄÚTHE CASE OF WAGNER.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎ

I OFFER MY CONCEPTION OF WHAT IS MODERN.‚ÄÎIN ITS MEASURE OF STRENGTH EVERY AGE ALSO POSSESSES A MEASURE FOR WHAT VIRTUES ARE PERMITTED AND FORBIDDEN TO IT. EITHER IT HAS THE VIRTUES OF ASCENDING LIFE: THEN IT WILL RESIST FROM THE PROFOUNDEST DEPTHS THE VIRTUES OF DECLINING LIFE. OR THE AGE ITSELF REPRESENTS DECLINING LIFE: THEN IT ALSO REQUIRES THE VIRTUES OF DECLINE, THEN IT HATES EVERYTHING THAT JUSTIFIES ITSELF SOLELY OUT OF ABUNDANCE, OUT OF THE OVERFLOWING RICHES OF STRENGTH. AESTHETICS IS TIED INDISSOLUBLY TO THESE BIOLOGICAL PRESUPPOSITIONS: THERE IS AN AESTHETICS OF DECADENCE, AND THERE IS A CLASSICAL AESTHETICS‚ÄÎTHE ‚ÄÚBEAUTIFUL IN ITSELF‚ÄÙ1 IS A FIGMENT OF THE IMAGINATION, LIKE ALL OF IDEALISM.‚ÄÎ

IN THE NARROWER SPHERE OF SO-CALLED MORAL VALUES ONE CANNOT FIND A GREATER CONTRAST THAN THAT BETWEEN A MASTER MORALITY2 AND THE MORALITY OF CHRISTIAN VALUE CONCEPTS: THE LATTER DEVELOPED ON SOIL THAT WAS MORBID THROUGH AND THROUGH (THE GOSPELS PRESENT US WITH PRECISELY THE SAME PHYSIOLOGICAL TYPES THAT DOSTOEVSKY‚ÄÔS NOVELS DESCRIBE),3 MASTER MORALITY (‚ÄÚROMAN,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚPAGAN,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚCLASSICAL,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚRENAISSANCE‚ÄÙ) IS, CONVERSELY, THE SIGN LANGUAGE OF WHAT HAS TURNED OUT WELL, OF ASCENDING LIFE, OF THE WILL TO POWER AS THE PRINCIPLE OF LIFE. MASTER MORALITY AFFIRMS AS INSTINCTIVELY AS CHRISTIAN MORALITY NEGATES (‚ÄÚGOD,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚBEYOND,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚSELF-DENIAL‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎALL OF THEM NEGATIONS). THE FORMER GIVES TO THINGS OUT OF ITS OWN ABUNDANCE‚ÄÎIT TRANSFIGURES, IT BEAUTIFIES THE WORLD AND MAKES IT MORE RATIONAL‚ÄÎTHE LATTER IMPOVERISHES, PALES AND MAKES UGLIER THE VALUE OF THINGS, IT NEGATES THE WORLD. ‚ÄÚWORLD‚ÄÙ IS A CHRISTIAN TERM OF ABUSE.‚ÄÎ

THESE OPPOSITE FORMS IN THE OPTICS OF VALUE ARE BOTH NECESSARY: THEY ARE WAYS OF SEEING, IMMUNE TO REASONS AND REFUTATIONS. ONE CANNOT REFUTE CHRISTIANITY; ONE CANNOT REFUTE A DISEASE OF THE EYE. THAT PESSIMISM WAS FOUGHT LIKE A PHILOSOPHY, WAS THE HEIGHT OF SCHOLARLY IDIOCY. THE CONCEPTS ‚ÄÚTRUE‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚUNTRUE‚ÄÙ HAVE, AS IT SEEMS TO ME, NO MEANING IN OPTICS.‚ÄÎ

WHAT ALONE SHOULD BE RESISTED IS THAT FALSENESS, THAT DECEITFUL-NESS OF INSTINCT WHICH REFUSES TO EXPERIENCE THESE OPPOSITES AS OPPOSITES‚ÄÎAS WAGNER, FOR EXAMPLE, REFUSED, BEING NO MEAN MASTER OF SUCH FALSEHOODS. TO MAKE EYES AT MASTER MORALITY, AT NOBLE MORALITY (ICELANDIC SAGA IS ALMOST ITS MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENT) WHILE MOUTHING THE COUNTERDOCTRINE, THAT OF THE ‚ÄÚGOSPEL OF THE LOWLY,‚ÄÙ OF THE NEED FOR REDEMPTION!‚ÄÎ

I ADMIRE, INCIDENTALLY, THE MODESTY OF THE CHRISTIANS WHO GO TO BAYREUTH. I MYSELF WOULDN‚ÄÔT BE ABLE TO ENDURE CERTAIN WORDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF A WAGNER. THERE ARE CONCEPTS WHICH DO NOT BELONG IN BAYREUTH.‚ÄÎ

WHAT? A VERSION OF CHRISTIANITY ADAPTED FOR FEMALE WAGNERIANS, PERHAPS BY FEMALE WAGNERIANS‚ÄÎFOR WAGNER WAS IN HIS OLD DAYS BY ALL MEANS FEMININI GENERIS? TO SAY IT ONCE MORE, THE CHRISTIANS OF TODAY ARE TOO MODEST FOR MY TASTE.‚ÄÎ

IF WAGNER WAS A CHRISTIAN, THEN LISZT WAS PERHAPS A CHURCH FATHER!4‚ÄÎTHE NEED FOR REDEMPTION, THE QUINTESSENCE OF ALL CHRISTIAN NEEDS, HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SUCH BUFFOONS: IT IS THE MOST HONEST EXPRESSION OF DECADENCE, IT IS THE MOST CONVINCED, MOST PAINFUL AFFIRMATION OF DECADENCE IN THE FORM OF SUBLIME SYMBOLS AND PRACTICES. THE CHRISTIAN WANTS TO BE RID OF HIMSELF. LE MOI EST TOUJOURS HA√ØSSABLE.5

NOBLE MORALITY, MASTER MORALITY, CONVERSELY, IS ROOTED IN A TRIUMPHANT YES SAID TO ONESELF‚ÄÎIT IS SELF-AFFIRMATION, SELF-GLORIFICATION OF LIFE; IT ALSO REQUIRES SUBLIME SYMBOLS AND PRACTICES, BUT ONLY BECAUSE ‚ÄÚITS HEART IS TOO FULL.‚ÄÙ ALL OF BEAUTIFUL, ALL OF GREAT ART BELONGS HERE: THE ESSENCE OF BOTH IS GRATITUDE. ON THE OTHER HAND, ONE CANNOT DISSOCIATE FROM IT AN INSTINCTIVE AVERSION AGAINST DECADENTS, SCORN FOR THEIR SYMBOLISM, EVEN HORROR: SUCH FEELINGS ALMOST PROVE IT. NOBLE ROMANS EXPERIENCED CHRISTIANITY AS FOEDA SUPERSTITIO:6 I RECALL HOW THE LAST GERMAN OF NOBLE TASTE, HOW GOETHE EXPERIENCED THE CROSS.7

ONE LOOKS IN VAIN FOR MORE VALUABLE, MORE NECESSARY OPPOSITES.‚ÄÎ*

BUT SUCH FALSENESS AS THAT OF BAYREUTH IS NO EXCEPTION TODAY. WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE UNAESTHETIC CONCEPT OF THE CHRISTIAN JUNKER. SUCH INNOCENCE AMONG OPPOSITES, SUCH A ‚ÄÚGOOD CONSCIENCE‚ÄÙ IN A LIE IS ACTUALLY MODERN PAR EXCELLENCE, IT ALMOST DEFINES MODERNITY. BIOLOGICALLY, MODERN MAN REPRESENTS A CONTRADICTION OF VALUES; HE SITS BETWEEN TWO CHAIRS, HE SAYS YES AND NO IN THE SAME BREATH. IS IT ANY WONDER THAT PRECISELY IN OUR TIMES FALSEHOOD ITSELF HAS BECOME FLESH AND EVEN GENIUS? THAT WAGNER ‚ÄÚDWELLED AMONG US‚ÄÙ? IT WAS NOT WITHOUT REASON THAT I CALLED WAGNER THE CAGLIOSTRO OF MODERNITY.‚ÄÎ

BUT ALL OF US HAVE, UNCONSCIOUSLY, INVOLUNTARILY IN OUR BODIES VALUES, WORDS, FORMULAS, MORALITIES OF OPPOSITE DESCENT‚ÄÎWE ARE, PHYSIOLOGICALLY CONSIDERED, FALSE.‚ÄÎA DIAGNOSIS OF THE MODERN SOUL‚ÄÎWHERE WOULD IT BEGIN? WITH A RESOLUTE INCISION INTO THIS INSTINCTIVE CONTRADICTION, WITH THE ISOLATION OF ITS OPPOSITE VALUES, WITH THE VIVISECTION OF THE MOST INSTRUCTIVE CASE.‚ÄÎTHE CASE OF WAGNER IS FOR THE PHILOSOPHER A WINDFALL‚ÄÎTHIS ESSAY IS INSPIRED, AS YOU HEAR, BY GRATITUDE.‚ÄÎ

‚Ä¶ DEAR FRIEND, DO YOU RECALL THAT IN TURIN I WROTE A LITTLE PAMPHLET? NOW WE ARE PRINTING IT; AND YOU ARE REQUESTED MOST URGENTLY TO HELP. NAUMANN2 ALREADY HAS YOUR ADDRESS. THE TITLE IS:

THE CASE OF WAGNER

A MUSICIANS‚ÄÔ PROBLEM

BY

FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.



IT IS SOMETHING AMUSING WITH A FOND OF ALMOST TOO MUCH SERIOUSNESS.‚ÄÎCOULD YOU GET HOLD OF WAGNER‚ÄÔS COLL. WRITINGS? I‚ÄÔD LIKE TO HAVE A FEW REFERENCES, TO BE ABLE TO QUOTE EXACTLY, WITH THE NUMBERS OF VOLUMES AND PAGES. (1) IN THE TEXT OF THE RING THERE IS A VARIANT OF BR√ºNNHILDE‚ÄÔS LAST ARIA THAT IS ENTIRELY BUDDHISTIC: I ONLY NEED THE NUMBERS OF VOLUME AND PAGE, NOT THE WORDS. (2) HOW DOES THIS PASSAGE IN TRISTAN GO LITERALLY:

THE AWFUL DEEP MYSTERIOUS GROUND,

WHO WILL PROCLAIM IT TO THE WORLD?



IS THIS RIGHT?

3) IN ONE OF HIS LAST WRITINGS WAGNER ONCE SAID‚ÄÎIN ITALICS IF I REMEMBER IT RIGHT‚ÄÎTHAT ‚ÄÚCHASTITY WORKS MIRACLES‚ÄÙ HERE I‚ÄÔD LIKE THE EXACT WORDING.

FOR THE REST I ASK YOU TO OFFER EVERY KIND OF OBJECTION, OF CRITICISM OF WORDING AND TASTE. THERE ARE MANY BOLD THINGS IN THIS LITTLE FABRICATION.‚ÄÎPROCEDURE WITH PRINTER‚ÄÔS PROOFS AS USUAL. ABOUT APPEARANCE, PAPER, ETC., NAUMANN AND I HAVE ALREADY REACHED AGREEMENT. THE MANUSCRIPT WILL BE IN HIS HANDS JULY 19‚Ä¶.

FROM GAST‚ÄÔS LETTER

TO NIETZSCHE, JULY 31, 1888

‚Ä¶ IN THE SCORE, WHICH ARRIVED RECENTLY FROM VENICE, MARKE‚ÄÔS3 QUESTION IS:

THE UNFATHOMABLY DEEP

MYSTERIOUS GROUND, ETC.



THE TEXT IN THE COLLECTED EDITION, IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN, IS

THE UNFATHOMABLE

AWFULLY DEEP

MYSTERIOUS GROUND.



IT WAS SOME SUCH ENTIRELY INSANE PILING UP OF WORDS.‚ÄÎ

LETTER TO GAST: SILS MARIA, AUGUST 9, 1888

DEAR FRIEND,

IN THE FIRST LINES OF THE PREFACE I HAD CHANGED THE WORDS ‚ÄÚMANY JOKES‚ÄÙ TO READ ‚ÄÚA HUNDRED JOKES.‚ÄÙ LOOKING BACK, THE WORD ‚ÄÚHUNDRED‚ÄÙ HERE SEEMS TO ME TOO STRONG; I SUGGEST THAT IN YOUR REVISION YOU RESTORE THE ORIGINAL ‚ÄÚMANY.‚ÄÙ

TODAY AN INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL DAY, COLORS OF THE SOUTH!

YOUR FRIEND

NIETZSCHE.

POSTCARD TO GAST: SILS MARIA, AUGUST 9, 1888

DEAR FRIEND,

THERE ARE STILL POSTSCRIPTS TO MY ‚ÄÚLETTER‚ÄÙ OF WHICH PROOFS MUST BE READ; I AM SORRY. A LOT OF PEPPER AND SALT; IN THE SECOND POSTSCRIPT I TAKE THE PROBLEM BY THE HORNS IN AMPLIFIED FORM (I SHAN‚ÄÔT EASILY FIND ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK OF THESE MATTERS AGAIN; THE FORM CHOSEN THIS TIME ALLOWS ME MANY ‚ÄÚLIBERTIES‚ÄÙ). AMONG OTHER THINGS, A JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD ALSO FOR BRAHMS. AT ONE POINT I EVEN PERMITTED MYSELF TO ALLUDE TO YOU‚ÄÎIN A FORM THAT WILL HAVE YOUR CONSENT, I HOPE.

JUST NOW I HAVE INSTRUCTED NAUMANN TO SEND YOU THE PRINTER‚ÄÔS PROOFS I CORRECTED LAST, MAKING QUITE A FEW CHANGES, FOR A FINAL REVISION.

WITH THE UTMOST GRATITUDE,

YOUR FRIEND

LETTER TO GAST: SILS MARIA, AUGUST 11, 1888

‚Ä¶ THE STRONGEST PASSAGES ARE REALLY IN THE ‚ÄÚPOSTSCRIPTS;‚ÄÙ AT ONE POINT I EVEN HAVE DOUBTS WHETHER I HAVE NOT GONE TOO FAR (NOT IN THE FACTS BUT IN SPEAKING OF THE FACTS). PERHAPS WE BETTER OMIT THE NOTE4 (IN WHICH SOMETHING IS SUGGESTED ABOUT WAGNER‚ÄÔS DESCENT) AND INSTEAD LEAVE LARGER SPACES BETWEEN THE MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS OF THE ‚ÄÚPOSTSCRIPT.‚ÄÙ ‚Ä¶5

FROM GAST‚ÄÔS LETTER TO NIETZSCHE, AUGUST 11, 1888

‚Ä¶ ‚ÄÚREDEMPTION FOR THE REDEEMER‚ÄÙ (6) ARE THE FINAL WORDS OF WAGNER‚ÄÔS PARSIFAL. WHETHER THE WAGNER ASSOCIATION IN MUNICH WAS THE FIRST IN GERMANY I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM, THOUGH I HAVE LOOKED IN LOTS OF PLACES: BUT PERHAPS YOU DON‚ÄÔT MEAN IT CHRONOLOGICALLY?‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚEVERYBODY‚ÄÙ,7 YOU MIGHT CHANGE TO ‚ÄÚBUT MANY ALSO MADE.‚ÄÙ

WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING ‚ÄÚBAYREUTH RHYMES ON INSTITUTE FOR COLD-WATER THERAPY‚ÄÙ (P. 46, LINE 8 FROM BOTTOM8) IS NOT IMMEDIATELY CLEAR TO THE READER. NEITHER IS ‚ÄÚSHE STANDS NAKED BEFORE HIM‚ÄÙ (P. 47, LINE 79)‚Ä¶.

LETTER TO GAST: SILS MARIA, AUGUST 18, 1888

DEAR FRIEND, DELIGHTED WITH YOUR LETTER, JUST RECEIVED.‚ÄÎREGARDING THE NOTE10, I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO RETAIN IT IN ITS ENTIRETY (EXCEPT FOR A MORE CAUTIOUS NUANCE IN THE QUESTION OF DESCENT). FOR IN A KIND OF EPILOGUE I RETURN WITH GREAT FORCE TO WAGNER‚ÄÔS FALSENESS: SO EVERY HINT IN THIS DIRECTION BECOMES VALUABLE. (THIS EPILOGUE I HAVE REWORKED SEVERAL TIMES. WHAT YOU WILL RECEIVE FROM THE PRINTER IS STILL NOT THE RIGHT VERSION. BUT SEND IT TO ME, CORRECTED!)‚ÄÎ

I DO MEAN THE VENETIAN EPIGRAMS (AND NOT THE ROMAN ELEGIES). IT IS A HISTORICAL FACT (AS I HAVE LEARNED FROM HEHN‚ÄÔS BOOK11) THAT THEY GAVE THE GREATEST OFFENSE‚Ä¶.

LETTER TO G AST: SILS MARIA, AUGUST 24, 1888

DEAR FRIEND, I AM JUST MAILING THE EPILOGUE TO NAUMANN WITH THE REQUEST THAT IT BE SENT TO YOU ONCE MORE FOR A FINAL REVISION. IT SEEMED USEFUL TO ME TO SAY A FEW THINGS MORE CLEARLY (IT SEEMED A FINESSE TO SHIELD CHRISTIANITY AGAINST WAGNER). ALSO, THE VERY LAST SENTENCE IS STRONGER NOW‚ÄÎALSO MORE CHEERFUL.

‚ÄÚOFF TO CRETE!‚ÄÙ IS A FAMOUS CHORUS IN LA BELLE H√©L√®NE.12 THIS I AM TELLING YOU FROM MALICE BECAUSE YOU ‚ÄÚINSTRUCTED‚ÄÙ ME ABOUT THE FINAL WORDS OF PARSIFAL. THESE ‚ÄÚLAST WORDS‚ÄÙ OF WAGNER HAD AFTER ALL BEEN MY LEITMOTIF‚Ä¶.

FROM GAST‚ÄÔS LETTER TO NIETZSCHE, SEPTEMBER 11, 1888

‚Ä¶ I DID NOT KNOW THAT ‚ÄÚOFF TO CRETE!‚ÄÙ COMES FROM LA BELLE H√©L√®NE. WHEN I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF INDICATING THE SOURCE OF THE WORDS ‚ÄÚREDEMPTION FOR THE REDEEMER,‚ÄÙ I WAS MISLED BY YOUR EXPRESSION WHICH LEADS ONE TO SUPPOSE THAT YOU ACCORD THE HONOR OF INVENTION TO THE PRESIDING OFFICERS OF THE WAGNER ASSOCIATION OF MUNICH‚Ä¶.

FROM NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS LETTER TO OVERBECK, OCTOBER 18, 1888

IT IS SURPRISING HOW EASILY ONE CAN LEARN FROM THIS ESSAY ABOUT THE DEGREE OF MY HETERODOXY WHICH ACTUALLY DOES NOT LEAVE A SINGLE STONE STANDING ON ANOTHER. AGAINST THE GERMANS I HERE ADVANCE ON ALL FRONTS: YOU‚ÄÔLL HAVE NO OCCASION FOR COMPLAINTS ABOUT ‚ÄÚAMBIGUITY.‚ÄÙ THIS UTTERLY IRRESPONSIBLE RACE WHICH HAS ON ITS CONSCIENCE ALL THE GREAT DISASTERS OF CIVILIZATION AND AT ALL DECISIVE MOMENTS OF HISTORY HAD SOMETHING ‚ÄÚELSE‚ÄÙ ON ITS MIND (THE REFORMATION AT THE TIME OF THE RENAISSANCE; KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY PRECISELY WHEN A SCIENTIFIC WAY OF THINKING HAD JUST BEEN ATTAINED WITH SOME TROUBLE IN ENGLAND AND FRANCE; ‚ÄÚWARS OF LIBERATION‚ÄÙ WHEN NAPOLEON APPEARED, THE ONLY MAN SO FAR WHO WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO TURN EUROPE INTO A POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNIT), NOW HAS ‚ÄÚTHE REICH‚ÄÙ ON ITS MIND‚ÄÎTHIS RECRUDESCENCE OF PETTY STATE POLITICS AND CULTURAL ATOMISM‚ÄÎAT A MOMENT WHEN THE GREAT QUESTION OF VALUES IS POSED FOR THE FIRST TIME. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MORE IMPORTANT MOMENT IN HISTORY: BUT WHO MIGHT BE AWARE OF THAT?

EDITOR‚ÄÔS INTRODUCTION





1


ECCE HOMO IS ONE OF THE TREASURES OF WORLD LITERATURE. WRITTEN IN 1888 AND FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1908, IT HAS BEEN LARGELY IGNORED OR MISUNDERSTOOD. YET IT IS NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS OWN INTERPRETATION OF HIS DEVELOPMENT, HIS WORKS, AND HIS SIGNIFICANCE; AND WE SHOULD GLADLY TRADE THE WHOLE VAST LITERATURE ON NIETZSCHE FOR THIS ONE SMALL BOOK. WHO WOULD NOT RATHER HAVE SHAKESPEARE ON SHAKESPEARE, INCLUDING THE POET‚ÄÔS OWN REFLECTIONS ON HIS PLAYS AND POEMS, THAN THE EXEGESES AND CONJECTURES OF THOUSANDS OF CRITICS AND PROFESSORS?

SOCRATES SAID IN THE APOLOGY THAT THE POETS ARE AMONG THE WORST INTERPRETERS OF THEIR OWN WORKS: THEY CREATE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING, ON THE WINGS OF INSPIRATION; BUT WHEN THEY DISCUSS THEIR WORKS THEY RELY ON THEIR UNINSPIRED REASON AND FALTER. BUT ECCE HOMO IS CLEARLY NOT THE WORK OF A PEDANT WHOSE GENIUS HAS QUIT HIM. IT IS ITSELF A WORK OF ART AND MARKS ONE OF THE HIGH POINTS OF GERMAN PROSE.

THERE ARE THOSE WHO LIKE NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS EARLY WORKS BEST‚ÄÎESPECIALLY THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY AND THE ‚ÄÚUNTIMELY‚ÄÙ MEDITATION ON HISTORIOGRAPHY; BUT THEY ARE FEW BY NOW AND NO LONGER A FORCE TO RECKON WITH. OTHERS HAVE ALWAYS PREFERRED THE APHORISTIC WORKS IN WHICH NIETZSCHE EMERGED AS GERMANY‚ÄÔS GREATEST MASTER OF PROSE. BY FAR THE LARGER NUMBER OF HIS READERS HAVE MOST ADMIRED ZARATHUSTRA. AND THE REST, INCLUDING THE GREATER PART OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN PHILOSOPHERS WHO TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY AT ALL, HAVE LITTLE DOUBT THAT BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL AND THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS ARE HIS FINEST BOOKS. I AM ASSUREDLY IN A MINORITY‚ÄÎPERHAPS OF ONE‚ÄÎWHEN I CONFESS THAT I LOVE BEST THE FIVE BOOKS NIETZSCHE WROTE DURING HIS LAST PRODUCTIVE YEAR, 1888‚ÄÎNOT LEAST BECAUSE THEY ARE SUCH BRILLIANT WORKS OF ART.

THE CASE OF WAGNER, THE TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS, THE ANTICHRIST, AND ECCE HOMO PRESENT A CRESCENDO WITHOUT EQUAL IN PROSE. THEN COMES THE FINAL WORK, NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER, NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS BRIEFEST AND MOST BEAUTIFUL BOOK‚ÄÎA SELECTION OF PASSAGES FROM HIS EARLIER WORKS, ADMITTEDLY VERY SLIGHTLY REVISED AND IMPROVED IN A FEW PLACES‚ÄÎAN ATTEMPT TO APPROXIMATE PERFECTION. THE PREFACE TO THAT BOOK WAS DATED CHRISTMAS 1888. A FEW DAYS LATER, DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF JANUARY, HE COLLAPSED ON THE STREET, RECOVERED SUFFICIENT LUCIDITY TO DISPATCH A FEW MAD BUT STRANGELY BEAUTIFUL LETTERS1‚ÄÎAND THEN DARKNESS CLOSED IN AND EXTINGUISHED PASSION AND INTELLIGENCE. HE SUFFERED AND THOUGHT NO MORE. HE HAD BURNT HIMSELF OUT.

WAS THE VEGETATING BODY THAT SURVIVED ANOTHER DECADE AND MORE, UNTIL AUGUST 1900, STILL THE POET AND PHILOSOPHER, ARTIST AND ANTICHRIST? SOCRATES GENTLY RIDICULED DISCIPLES WHO THOUGHT THAT THE BODY THAT REMAINED AFTER HIS DEATH WOULD STILL BE SOCRATES. BUT REPRODUCTIONS OF PORTRAITS OF NIETZSCHE IN THE EIGHTEEN-NINETIES, COMMISSIONED BY HIS, SISTER WHO LET HIS MUSTACHE GROW AS HE HIMSELF NEVER HAD, WHO CLAD HIM IN WHITE ROBES AND FANCIED HIS VACANT STARE‚ÄÎPORTRAITS THAT SHOW NO GLIMPSE OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS VANISHED SPIRIT‚ÄÎTHESE APPEAR WITH HIS BOOKS TO THIS DAY.

OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS LAST WORKS, NONE HAS PROVED HARDER TO UNDERSTAND THAN ECCE HOMO, THE SELF-PORTRAIT IS NOT NATURALISTIC; HENCE, IT WAS WIDELY FELT, IT IS CLEARLY INSANE AND TO BE DISREGARDED. THIS PREVALENT VIEW IS DOUBLY FALSE. THE LACK OF NATURALISM IS NOT PROOF OF INSANITY BUT A TRIUMPH OF STYLE‚ÄÎOF A PIECE WITH THE BEST PAINTINGS OF THAT TIME. AND EVEN IF WHAT MIGHT BE INTERPRETED AS SIGNS OF MADNESS DO OCCASIONALLY FLICKER IN A PASSAGE, THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE PORTRAIT CAN THEREFORE BE IGNORED. IN BOTH RESPECTS NIETZSCHE SHOULD BE COMPARED WITH VAN GOGH.

ECCE HOMO DOES NOT FIT ANY ORDINARY CONCEPTION OF PHILOSOPHERS. IT IS NOT ONLY REMOTE FROM THE WORLD OF PROFESSORIAL OR DONNISH PHILOSOPHY, FROM TOMES AND ARTICLES, FOOTNOTES AND JARGON‚ÄÎIN BRIEF, FROM THE MODERN IMAGE. IT IS EQUALLY FAR FROM THE POPULAR NOTION OF THE WISE MAN: SERENE, PAST PASSION, TEMPERATE, AND APOLLINIAN. BUT THIS IS PLAINLY PART OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS POINT: TO OFFER A NEW IMAGE‚ÄÎA PHILOSOPHER WHO IS NOT AN ALEXANDRIAN ACADEMICIAN, NOR AN APOLLINIAN SAGE, BUT DIONYSIAN.

WHILE VAN GOGH, HAVING FLED HIS NATIVE NORTH, BURNT HIMSELF OUT IN SOUTHERN FRANCE, CREATING AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF WORKS WITHOUT ANY PUBLIC RECOGNITION, FIGHTING TIME TILL 1890, WHEN MADNESS COULD NO LONGER BE HELD OFF AND HE SHOT HIMSELF, NIETZSCHE SPENT HIMSELF WITH COMPARABLE PASSION JUST A FEW MILES FURTHER EAST, WRITING FEVERISHLY‚ÄÎNOT EVEN PAUSING, AS IN KEEPING WITH HIS OWN IDEAS HE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE, TO TAKE HIS LIFE BEFORE HIS SPIRIT QUIT IT. FREUD USED TO SAY OF HIM THAT ‚ÄÚHE HAD A MORE PENETRATING KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF THAN ANY OTHER MAN WHO EVER LIVED OR WAS EVER LIKELY TO LIVE‚ÄÙ;2 YET NIETZSCHE WAS NOT AWARE OF HIS IMPENDING MADNESS AND THEREFORE, UNABLE TO FORESTALL IT.

IN HIS FIRST BOOK NIETZSCHE HAD TRACED THE ‚ÄÚBIRTH OF TRAGEDY‚ÄÙ TO THE CREATIVE FUSION OF THE APOLLINIAN AND THE DIONYSIAN, AND THE DEATH OF TRAGEDY TO THE IMPERIOUS RATIONALISM FOR WHICH HE FOUND THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SYMBOL IN SOCRATES. THEN HE HAD FOUND A REBIRTH OF TRAGEDY IN WAGNER‚ÄÔS WORK AND HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THE ADVENT OF AN ‚ÄÚARTISTIC SOCRATES‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎNIETZSCHE HIMSELF. THE CRITICAL PASSION, THE REVOLT AGAINST HALLOWED PIETIES, THE DEMAND FOR CLARITY, AND THE FUSION OF LIFE AND THOUGHT NEED NOT ALWAYS REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE SPIRIT OF ART AND NEED NOT INSPIRE SUCH CONFIDENCE IN THE UNAIDED REASON THAT ONE‚ÄÔS HEIR WOULD PROCEED TO PROSCRIBE ALL TRAGEDY, AS PLATO DID; RATHER, ALL THIS MIGHT BE MERGED WITH A VISION OF THE WORLD THAT WOULD BE CLOSER TO SOPHOCLES, AND WITH A POETIC TEMPERAMENT PARTAKING MORE OF PINDAR THAN OF PLATO, MORE OF DIONYSUS THAN APOLLO. ECCE HOMO IS THE APOLOGY OF THIS ‚ÄÚARTISTIC SOCRATES:‚ÄÙ

PLATO‚ÄÔS SOCRATES HAD CLAIMED IN HIS APOLOGY THAT HE WAS THE WISEST OF MEN, NOT BECAUSE HE WAS SO WISE BUT BECAUSE HIS FELLOW MEN WERE SO STUPID, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO WERE CONSIDERED THE WISEST‚ÄÎFOR THEY THOUGHT THEY KNEW WHAT IN FACT THEY DID NOT KNOW. AND SOCRATES, ACCUSED OF IMPIETY AND CORRUPTING THE YOUTH OF ATHENS, ARGUED THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY THE CITY‚ÄÔS GREATEST BENEFACTOR AND DESERVING OF THE HIGHEST HONORS. THUS, ECCE HOMO COULD HAVE BEEN ENTITLED ‚ÄÚVARIATIONS ON A THEME BY SOCRATES.‚ÄÙ THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ARTISTIC TITLE, BUT OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR A WRITER WHO HAD JUST FINISHED THE ANTICHRIST. ECCE HOMO‚ÄÎTHE WORDS PILATE HAD, ACCORDING TO JOHN (19:5), SPOKEN OF JESUS: ‚ÄÚBEHOLD THE MAN!‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎSEEMED MORE TO THE POINT. BUT THAT POINT WAS NOT TO SUGGEST ANY CLOSE SIMILARITY BETWEEN HIMSELF AND JESUS; MORE NEARLY THE OPPOSITE. HERE IS A MAN! HERE IS A NEW, A DIFFERENT IMAGE OF HUMANITY: NOT A SAINT OR HOLY MAN ANY MORE THAN A TRADITIONAL SAGE, BUT A MODERN VERSION.

IN THE TEXT NIETZSCHE SAID HE WISHED TO PREVENT ANY MISCHIEVOUS USE OF HIMSELF‚ÄÎDOSS MAN UNFUG MIT MIR TREIBT. OUR KNOWLEDGE THAT TWO MONTHS AFTER FINISHING THE FIRST DRAFT OF THE BOOK, AND LESS THAN FOUR WEEKS AFTER HE HAD GONE OVER THE WHOLE WORK ONCE MORE, HE BECAME INSANE GIVES THE BOOK A TRAGIC DIMENSION THAT IS HEIGHTENED ALMOST INTOLERABLY IF WE BEAR IN MIND HOW HE FAILED TO PREVENT THE MISCHIEF HE FEARED. THE FIRST SECTION OF THE PREFACE ENDS: ‚ÄÚABOVE ALL, DO NOT MISTAKE ME FOR SOMEONE ELSE!‚ÄÙ HE UNDERLINED THIS CRY‚ÄÎBUT SOON HIS SISTER IMPOSED HER EXCEEDINGLY UNSUBTLE NOTION OF HERO AND PROPHET ON A MINDLESS INVALID‚ÄÎAND IN HER SIGN HE TRIUMPHED.

THAT WAS BUT THE BEGINNING. FAR WORSE MISCHIEF FOLLOWED. NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS VOICE WAS DROWNED OUT AS MISINTERPRETATIONS THAT HE HAD EXPLICITLY REPUDIATED WITH MUCH WIT AND MALICE WERE ACCEPTED AND REPEATED, AND REPEATED AND ACCEPTED, UNTIL MOST READERS KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT BEFORE THEY READ NIETZSCHE, AND SO READ NOTHING BUT WHAT THEY HAD LONG EXPECTED.

WHAT OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS COMMENTS ON HIS OWN WORKS? CAN HIS INTERPRETATIONS REALLY BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY?

THE VERY QUESTION SMACKS OF AN OBSCENE REVALUATION OF ALL VALUES, THROUGH WHICH, SOON AFTER THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN, EVERYTHING WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS SISTER HAD MOCKED HER BROTHER‚ÄÔS CLAIMS TO FAME, BUT THEN, SWITCHING TO HIS CAUSE AFTER HER HUSBAND‚ÄÔS SUICIDE, SHE TOOK PRIVATE LESSONS IN NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS PHILOSOPHY FROM RUDOLF STEINER, A GOETHE SCHOLAR WHO LATER BECAME FAMOUS AS THE FOUNDER OF ANTHROPOSOPHY. SOON STEINER GAVE HER UP AS SIMPLY INCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING NIETZSCHE. MEANWHILE SHE BECAME HER BROTHER‚ÄÔS OFFICIAL EXEGETE AND BIOGRAPHER, TAMPERED WITH HIS LETTERS‚ÄÎAND WAS TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY ALMOST EVERYONE. AND WHO WAS NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY? EVEN THE MOST UNSCRUPULOUS NAZI INTERPRETATIONS WERE TAKEN SERIOUSLY NOT ONLY INSIDE GERMANY, BUT BY A HOST OF FOREIGN SCHOLARS WHO DID NOT BOTHER TO CHECK NAZI QUOTATIONS.

EARLIER, ERNST BERTRAM HAD FRANKLY SUBTITLED HIS INTERPRETATION ‚ÄÚATTEMPT AT A MYTHOLOGY‚ÄÙ: BUT WHO CHECKED HIS QUOTATIONS? AND WHOSE NIETZSCHE IMAGE, EXCEPT THE SISTER‚ÄÔS, WAS TAKEN MORE SERIOUSLY FROM 1918, WHEN BERTRAM‚ÄÔS NIETZSCHE APPEARED, UNTIL 1933 WHEN HITLER BROKE OUT? OR WHO CHECKED JASPERS‚ÄÔ QUOTATIONS IN THEIR CONTEXT? (THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF HIS NIETZSCHE OMITS ALL SOURCE REFERENCES, AS BERTRAM HAD DONE.)

IT WOULD BE POINTLESS TO RESCUE FROM THEIR IMMINENT OBLIVION MANY LESSER FIGURES WHO HAVE ALSO ASSOCIATED THEIR NAMES WITH NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS, WRITING ABOUT HIM WITHOUT HAVING READ CAREFULLY THE WORKS THEY DISCUSS, OR EDITING HIM BY SELECTING PASSAGES FROM HOPELESS MISTRANSLATIONS THAT THESE PROFESSORS LACKED THE GERMAN OR THE PATIENCE TO CHECK. YET SUCH PUBLICATIONS ARE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND USED AS THE BASIS FOR MANY DISCUSSIONS IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.

WHILE SOME OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS SELF-INTERPRETATIONS ARE MUCH LESS PERSUASIVE THAN OTHERS, ALL OF THEM HAVE SEVERAL INESTIMABLE ADVANTAGES OVER ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT PASSES AS SERIOUS LITERATURE ABOUT HIM: HE DID NOT DISCUSS ANY OF HIS WORKS WITHOUT HAVING READ THEM CAREFULLY, MORE THAN ONCE; INDEED, HE DID NOT DISCUSS ANY WITHOUT KNOWING ALL OF THEM, IN THE SEQUENCE IN WHICH THEY WERE WRITTEN‚ÄÎAND, OF COURSE, IN THE ORIGINAL. HE ALSO KNEW ALL OF HIS LETTERS, AS WELL AS HIS UNPUBLISHED FRAGMENTS AND NOTES. AND HE WROTE ABOUT HIS OEUVRE WITH SINGULAR PENETRATION, WIT, AND STYLE.

LET US BE SPECIFIC: DO HIS COMMENTS ON THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY MAKE SENSE? VERY LITTLE WRITTEN ON THAT BOOK IS AS ILLUMINATING, AND MOST DISCUSSIONS OF THE BOOK ARE DATED BY NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS OWN DISCUSSION, WHICH LONG ANTEDATES THEM.

YET ECCE HOMO HAS ITS FAULTS. IT CONTAINS ALL TOO MANY REFERENCES TO ZARATHUSTRA‚ÄÎMOST OF THEM EMBARRASSING‚ÄÎAND THE NUMEROUS LONG QUOTATIONS FROM THAT BOOK ARE ALMOST RENDERED POINTLESS BY ZARATHUSTRA‚ÄÔS GREAT POSTHUMOUS SUCCESS: THE QUOTATIONS WERE INTENDED FOR READERS WHO DID NOT KNOW THAT BOOK. AND ALTHOUGH NIETZSCHE HAS OFTEN BEEN LINKED WITH GERMAN NATIONALISM, HIS REMARKS ABOUT THE GERMANS ARE OPEN TO CRITICISM FOR BEING TOO EXTREME IN STRESSING WHAT HE FINDS ABOMINABLE.

WE RETURN TO THE QUESTION OF NATURALISM. NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS PORTRAIT OF THE GERMANS IS NOT MEANT TO BE OBJECTIVE. IT PARTAKES MORE NEARLY OF THE SPIRIT OF GEORGE GROSZ, WHO, AFTER WORLD WAR I, ENTITLED A COLLECTION OF HIS GRAPHIC ATTACKS ON HIS COUNTRYMEN, ECCE HOMO. BUT WE ALSO HEAR THE ANGUISHED CRY OF ONE WHO SEES‚ÄÎFORESEES‚ÄÎHIMSELF MISTAKEN FOR A WRITER HE IS NOT: FOR AN APOSTLE OF MILITARY POWER AND EMPIRE, A NATIONALIST, AND EVEN A RACIST. IN ORDER TO DEFINE HIMSELF EMPHATICALLY, NIETZSCHE UNDERLINES (TOO OFTEN) AND SHRIEKS‚ÄÎTO NO AVAIL. THOSE WHO CONSTRUE THE OVERMAN IN EVOLUTIONARY TERMS HE CALLS ‚ÄÚOXEN‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎIN VAIN. RESPECTED PROFESSORS STILL WRITE BOOKS IN WHICH NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS ETHICS IS PRESENTED AS ‚ÄÚEVOLUTIONARY.‚ÄÙ

THE BREAK WITH WAGNER? NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS PICTURE IS STYLIZED, NOT FALSE. THERE IS, OF COURSE, HINDSIGHT IN IT; BUT READERS OF SARTRE SHOULD KNOW, IF THEY HAVE NOT LEARNED IT FIRSTHAND FROM NIETZSCHE HIMSELF, THAT AN ACT IS ONE EVENT, AND THE WAY WE INTERPRET IT AFTERWARD AND RELATE OURSELVES TO IT IS ANOTHER. LOOKING BACK ON THE YEAR IN WHICH HE RESIGNED FROM THE UNIVERSITY, PUBLISHED HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN WITH A DEDICATION TO VOLTAIRE‚ÄÎTURNING FROM GERMAN ROMANTICISM TO THE FRENCH ENLIGHTENMENT, AND FROM WAGNER TO INDEPENDENCE‚ÄÎHE FELT, MORE CLEARLY THAN HE HAD FELT IT AT THE TIME, THAT THIS HAD BEEN HIS RUBICON, THE TURNING POINT IN HIS LIFE. CAN ONE DENY THAT IT WAS?

FOR ALL THAT, IS WAGNER REPRESENTED IN A MANICHAEAN SPIRIT, AS THE FORCE OF EVIL, AS A DRAGON? ON THE CONTRARY, THE PORTRAIT IS IMBUED WITH GRATITUDE AND LOVE‚ÄÎWITH AMOR FATI, LOVE OF FATE. THERE IS NO ‚ÄÚIF ONLY‚ÄÙ IN THIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY, AND THERE ARE NO EXCUSES. A MAN WHO WAS IN PHYSICAL AGONY MUCH OF HIS ADULT LIFE AND WARNED BY HIS DOCTORS NOT TO READ OR WRITE MUCH LEST HE STRAIN HIS HALF-BLIND EYES, DOES NOT ONCE COMPLAIN. HE IS THANKFUL FOR HIS ILLNESS AND TELLS US HOW IT MADE HIS LIFE BETTER.

THE PHILOSOPHICAL AND RELIGIOUS LITERATURE OF THE WORLD DOES NOT CONTAIN MANY SAYINGS THAT EQUAL THE WISDOM AND NOBILITY OF ZARATHUSTRA‚ÄÔS CHALLENGE: ‚ÄÚIF YOU HAVE AN ENEMY, DO NOT REQUITE HIM EVIL WITH GOOD, FOR THAT WOULD PUT HIM TO SHAME. RATHER PROVE THAT HE DID YOU SOME GOOD.‚ÄÙ3 IN ECCE HOMO NIETZSCHE EMBODIES THIS ATTITUDE, THIS TRIUMPH OVER RESSENTIMENT. INSTEAD OF BEARING A GRUDGE TOWARD THE WORLD THAT TREATED HIM SO CRUELLY, INSTEAD OF SUCCUMBING TO THE RANCOR OF SICKNESS, HE RELATES THE STORY OF HIS LIFE AND WORK IN A SPIRIT OF GRATITUDE‚ÄÎAND GOES OUT OF HIS WAY TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO PAUL R√©E AND LOU SALOM√©,4 WITH WHOM HE HAD FALLEN OUT.

ECCE HOMO, ‚ÄÚDIONYSUS VERSUS THE CRUCIFIED‚ÄÙ: THE CONTRAST WITH THE JESUS OF THE GOSPELS IS CENTRAL. THE JESUS OF THE GOSPELS‚ÄÎWHO, NIETZSCHE ARGUED IN THE ANTICHRIST, IS DIFFERENT IN THIS RESPECT FROM THE HISTORIC JESUS‚ÄÎIS FAR FROM BEING ABOVE RESENTMENT: NOT ONLY DOES HE OBSESSIVELY SLANDER HIS ENEMIES, HE STANDS OPPOSED TO THIS WORLD AND THIS LIFE, AND NEITHER TAKES NOR TEACHES ANY JOY IN SMALL PLEASURES AND BEAUTIES. THE STRANGE EMPHASIS ON LITTLE THINGS, MATERIAL FACTORS GENERALLY THOUGHT BENEATH THE NOTICE OF PHILOSOPHERS AND SAGES, THAT DISTINGUISHES THE FIRST TWO CHAPTERS OF ECCE HOMO HAS TO BE SEEN IN THIS LIGHT, TOO. THIS THEME WAS PICKED UP BY CAMUS, ALSO WITH AN ANTI-CHRISTIAN PATHOS, BUT RESTRAINED BY LYRICISM AND HIS DISTINCTIVE CHARM. NIETZSCHE, LIKE SOCRATES WHO WAS SAID TO LOOK LIKE A SATYR, DISDAINS CHARM AND EMBRACES IRONY AND SARCASM: HE IS NOT INGRATIATING, BUT WANTS TO GIVE OFFENSE. IS THERE NO RESENTMENT IN THAT?

IN THE CASE OF SOCRATES, NIETZSCHE EMPHASIZED THE ELEMENT OF RANCOR IN HIS SARCASM‚ÄÎWHAT HE CALLED BOSHEIT, MALICE. AND IN THAT CASE MANY DID NOT WISH TO SEE SOCRATES IN THIS LIGHT AND, BECAUSE SOCRATES WAS FELT TO BE IDEAL, TRANQUIL, THE PERFECT SAGE, TOOK OFFENSE AT NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS PORTRAIT. ONLY THE SAFE DISTANCE OF MORE THAN TWENTY CENTURIES COULD MAKE THE HERO OF THE APOLOGY LOOK SAINTLY. NO DOUBT, THOSE WHO HAD HEARD HIS APOLOGY, FELT WHAT NIETZSCHE SAW‚ÄÎAND HAD SMARTED UNDER IT FOR YEARS. AFTER ALL, WHAT SOCRATES BOASTED OF WAS PERFECTLY TRUE: HE HAD TAKEN PLEASURE IN ENGAGING MEN OF REPUTATION IN THE MARKETPLACE TO HUMILIATE THEM BEFORE THE CROWD THAT GATHERED‚ÄÎOFTEN (ASSUMING, AS IS SURELY FAIR, THAT PLATO DID NOT MEAN TO SLANDER SOCRATES) BY USING CLEVER DEBATER‚ÄÔS TRICKS. HE HAD A WICKED SENSE OF HUMOR AND FOUND ALL THIS VERY FUNNY; THOSE HE BESTED CERTAINLY DID NOT.

GOETHE, TOO, POSSESSED NOT ONLY THE SERENITY OF AMOR FATI5 BUT ALSO AN OLYMPIAN MALICE. BUT EVEN IF NIETZSCHE IS IN NOBLE COMPANY, WAS THERE NOT AFTER ALL RESENTMENT IN HIM, EVEN IN ECCE HOMO? IT IS A MATTER OF WHAT NIETZSCHE CALLED IN THE GAY SCIENCE ‚ÄÚGIVING STYLE TO ONE‚ÄÔS CHARACTER.‚ÄÙ THE NEGATIVE FEELINGS, HE TAUGHT, SHOULD NOT BE SUPPRESSED, MUCH LESS EXTIRPATED; THEY SHOULD BE SUBLIMATED. AND IN ECCE HOMO HE DISCUSSES HOW HE WAS BOTH A NO-SAYING AND A YES-SAYING SPIRIT. THE NEGATIVE FEELINGS ARE NOT VENTED ON INDIVIDUALS OR DIRECTED AGAINST LIFE OR THE WORLD; THEY ARE MOBILIZED IN THE SERVICE OF LIFE AND CREATIVITY AGAINST OBSTRUCTIONS, MOVEMENTS, CAUSES.

ULTIMATE NOBILITY MUST RISE ABOVE RANCOR AND MUST YET BE CAPABLE OF ECHOING VOLTAIRE‚ÄÔS CRY, √©CRASEZ L‚ÄÔINF√¢ME.6 RESENTMENT IS REPREHENSIBLE, BUT SO IS THE FAILURE TO ENGAGE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INFAMY. IT IS ONLY WHEN THE INFAMY TO BE CRUSHED TURNS OUT TO BE CHRISTIANITY THAT MOST READERS RECOIL. BUT NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS ATTACK, OF COURSE, DEPENDS ON HIS CONCEPTION OF CHRISTIANITY AND‚ÄÎAS HE HIMSELF INSISTS‚ÄÎCANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD AT ALL EXCEPT AS A PART OF HIS CAMPAIGN AGAINST RESENTMENT.

INDEED, THIS ATTACK SEEMS TO ME MUCH MORE SUCCESSFULLY STYLIZED THAN NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS DENUNCIATIONS OF THE GERMANS. SINCE WORLD WAR II THE GERMANS MAY SEEM FAIR GAME, BUT NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS INDICTMENTS ARE SOMETIMES STAINED BY HIS OWN WOUNDS: IN MORE THAN ONE PASSAGE HE FALLS SHORT OF HIS OWN STANDARDS, AND RESENTMENT CLINGS TO HIM LIKE A LEECH.

NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS TIES TO THE PRE-CHRISTIAN WORLD ARE STRONGER THAN IS USUALLY SUPPOSED, THOUGH THIS SHOULD NOT SURPRISE US IN A CLASSICAL PHILOLOGIST WHO, EVEN IN HIS TEENS, NOURISHED HIS SPIRIT AND EMOTIONS ON GREEK LITERATURE AND THOUGHT. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR A LENGTHY SURVEY OF CLASSICAL INSPIRATIONS, BUT IN ADDITION TO SOCRATES‚ÄÔ APOLOGY WE MUST MENTION ARISTOTLE‚ÄÔS PORTRAIT OF THE GREAT-SOULED MAN IN THE NICOMACHEAN ETHICS. IT IS A COMMONPLACE THAT ARISTOTLE‚ÄÔS ETHICS WAS BASED IN LARGE MEASURE ON THE MORALITY OF ATHENIAN GENTLEMEN, AND THAT THE MAN DESCRIBED IN THIS PASSAGE REPRESENTS NOT MERELY ARISTOTLE‚ÄÔS IDEAL BUT A TYPE VERY MUCH ADMIRED IN ATHENS. IT HAS NOT BEEN WIDELY NOTICED‚ÄÎAND FOR ALL I KNOW, I MAY HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO POINT THIS OUT SOME YEARS AGO‚ÄÎTHAT ARISTOTLE‚ÄÔS PORTRAIT WAS PROBABLY INSPIRED IN PART BY SOCRATES‚ÄÔ APOLOGY. IN ANY CASE, BOTH LEFT THEIR MARK ON ECCE HOMO.

‚ÄÚA PERSON IS THOUGHT TO BE GREAT-SOULED IF HE CLAIMS MUCH AND DESERVES MUCH.‚ÄÙ ARISTOTLE‚ÄÔS WORDS‚ÄÎANTITHETICAL AS THEY ARE TO THE CHRISTIAN INFLUENCE ON MODERN MORALITY‚ÄÎREPRESENT ONE OF THE LEITMOTIFS OF ECCE HOMO. ‚ÄÚHE DOES NOT BEAR A GRUDGE‚ÄÙ REPRESENTS ANOTHER. THAT HE DOES NOT SPEAK EVIL ‚ÄÚEVEN OF HIS ENEMIES, EXCEPT WHEN HE DELIBERATELY INTENDS TO GIVE OFFENSE,‚ÄÙ IS A THIRD. BUT ARISTOTLE‚ÄÔS WHOLE PORTRAIT IS RELEVANT.7 AND TO NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CENTRAL CONTRAST OF THE NEW TESTAMENT AND THE GREEKS, GREEK TRAGEDY, THUCYDIDES, AND THE ILIAD ARE RELEVANT, TOO. AND SO IS GREEK COMEDY; SO ARE THE SATYRS, THE COMPANIONS OF DIONYSUS; SO ARE GREEK LAUGHTER AND SOCRATIC IRONY. IT SHOULD NOT BE ASSUMED THAT THE CHAPTER TITLES OF ECCE HOMO ARE DEVOID OF ALL HUMOR. NEITHER, OF COURSE, IS NIETZSCHE ONLY SPEAKING IN JEST WHEN HE EXPLAINS, ‚ÄÚWHY I WRITE SUCH GOOD BOOKS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎANY MORE THAN GEORGE BERNARD SHAW WAS ONLY JESTING WHEN HE SPOKE IN A SIMILAR VEIN.

LOOKING FOR A PRE-CHRISTIAN, GREEK SYMBOL THAT HE MIGHT OPPOSE TO ‚ÄÚTHE CRUCIFIED,‚ÄÙ NIETZSCHE FOUND DIONYSUS. HIS ‚ÄÚDIONYSUS‚ÄÙ IS NEITHER THE GOD OF THE ANCIENT DIONYSIAN FESTIVALS NOR THE GOD NIETZSCHE HAD PLAYED OFF AGAINST APOLLO IN THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY, ALTHOUGH HE DOES, OF COURSE, BEAR SOME OF THE FEATURES OF BOTH. IN THE LATER WORKS OF NIETZSCHE, ‚ÄÚDIONYSUS‚ÄÙ IS NO LONGER THE SPIRIT OF UNRESTRAINED PASSION, BUT THE SYMBOL OF THE AFFIRMATION OF LIFE WITH ALL ITS SUFFERING AND TERROR. ‚ÄÚTHE PROBLEM,‚ÄÙ NIETZSCHE EXPLAINED IN A NOTE THAT WAS LATER INCLUDED IN THE POSTHUMOUS WILL TO POWER (SECTION 1052), ‚ÄÚIS THAT OF THE MEANING OF SUFFERING: WHETHER A CHRISTIAN MEANING OR A TRAGIC MEANING‚Ä¶. THE TRAGIC MAN AFFIRMS EVEN THE HARSHEST SUFFERING.‚ÄÙ AND ECCE HOMO IS, NOT LEAST OF ALL, NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS FINAL AFFIRMATION OF HIS OWN CRUEL LIFE.

A NOTE ON THE PUBLICATION OF ECCE HOMO


MANY WHO HAVE NEVER CAREFULLY READ ANY OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS WORKS HAVE READ ABOUT TWO GERMAN EDITIONS OF THE WORKS THAT ELICITED SOME SENSATIONAL BUT UNINFORMED COMMENTS IN PRINT. THE FIRST WAS KARL SCHLECHTA‚ÄÔS EDITION OF ALL OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS BOOKS AND A SELECTION FROM HIS NOTES, FRAGMENTS, AND LETTERS, IN THREE VOLUMES. BUT SCHLECHTA SIMPLY REPRINTED THE PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED VERSIONS OF ECCE HOMO AND NEED NOT BE CONSIDERED HERE.

THE SECOND WAS ERICH F. PODACH‚ÄÔS BOOK, FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHES WERKE DES ZUSAMMENBRUCHS (1961),1 WHICH OFFERED TEXTS OF NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER, THE ANTICHRIST, ECCE HOMO, AND THE SO-CALLED DIONYSUS DITHYRAMBS THAT WERE SAID TO SUPERSEDE ALL PREVIOUS EDITIONS. I HAVE SHOWN ELSEWHERE2 HOW ILL-FOUNDED PODACH‚ÄÔS STRIDENT CLAIMS ARE. HERE WE NEED ONLY CONSIDER HIS HANDLING OF ECCE HOMO. HE AIMS TO SHOW THAT ‚ÄÚTHE HITHERTO FAMILIAR ECCE HOMO DOES NOT EXIST‚ÄÙ (P. 208). THIS SENSATIONAL CHARGE HAS TO BE MET HERE, EVEN IF SOME READERS SHOULD PREFER TO SKIM THE NEXT SIX PARAGRAPHS.

PODACH PRINTS THE MANUSCRIPT WITH NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS EDITORIAL DIRECTIONS, SUCH AS REQUESTS TO INSERT OR MOVE PASSAGES; HE REPRODUCES ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS OF THE SAME PASSAGES, INCLUDING PAGES THAT HAD BEEN PASTED OVER; AND HE ADMITS THAT HE HAS ‚ÄÚNOT INDICATED WHERE WHOLE SECTIONS IN THE MANUSCRIPT SENT TO THE PRINTER ARE CROSSED OUT. HERE SOME OF THE TEXTS SHOW PLAINLY THAT THEY ARE VARIANTS OR PRELIMINARY VERSIONS, WHILE IN OTHER CASES [VERY FEW] IT CANNOT BE DECIDED WHETHER N OR GAST [NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS YOUNG FRIEND WHO HELPED HIM WITH EDITORIAL CHORES AND PROOFS] HAS DELETED THEM‚ÄÙ (P. 408).

IN FACT, ECCE HOMO WAS BEGUN OCTOBER 15, 1888, ON NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS FORTY-FOURTH BIRTHDAY, AND FINISHED NOVEMBER 4. A FEW DAYS LATER NIETZSCHE SENT THE MANUSCRIPT TO HIS PUBLISHER, NAUMANN; BUT ON NOVEMBER 20 HE MENTIONED SOME ADDITIONS IN A LETTER TO GEORG BRANDES, THE DANISH CRITIC WHO WAS THE FIRST TO LECTURE ON NIETZSCHE AT A UNIVERSITY (COPENHAGEN); AND THEN HE ALSO MENTIONED ADDITIONS TO NAUMANN. ON A POSTCARD, NOVEMBER 27, HE ASKED NAUMANN TO RETURN ‚ÄÚTHE SECOND PART OF THE MS ‚Ä¶ BECAUSE I STILL WANT TO INSERT SOME THINGS,‚ÄÙ AND EXPLAINED THAT HE MEANT ‚ÄÚTHE WHOLE SECOND HALF OF THE MS, BEGINNING WITH THE SECTION ENTITLED ‚ÄÒTHUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA.‚ÄÔ I ASSUME THAT THIS WON‚ÄÔT DELAY THE PRINTING FOR EVEN A MOMENT AS I SHALL SEND BACK THE MS IMMEDIATELY.‚ÄÙ ON DECEMBER 1 HE ACKNOWLEDGED RECEIPT OF THE SECOND HALF BUT REQUESTED THE RETURN OF THE WHOLE MS, INCLUDING THE ADDITIONS: ‚ÄÚI WANT TO GIVE YOU A MS AS GOOD AS THE LAST ONE, AT THE RISK THAT I HAVE TO BE A COPIER FOR ANOTHER WEEK.‚ÄÙ ON DECEMBER 3 NAUMANN REPLIED THAT HE WAS RETURNING THE MS, BUT ‚ÄÚCOPYING IT ONCE MORE I DO NOT CONSIDER NECESSARY; I MERELY SHOULD ESPECIALLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU READ THE PROOFS CAREFULLY ALTHOUGH I SHALL MAKE A POINT OF DOING LIKEWISE.‚ÄÙ THIS SHOWS PLAINLY HOW WRONG PODACH‚ÄÔS CLAIMS ARE: THE PUBLISHER FOUND THE MANUSCRIPT FINISHED, CLEAR, AND PRINTABLE.

NOR DID NIETZSCHE KEEP IT LONG. ON DECEMBER 6, HE TELEGRAPHED NAUMANN: ‚ÄÚMS BACK. EVERYTHING REWORKED [UMGEARBEITETY].‚ÄÙ AND ON THE EIGHTH, NIETZSCHE WROTE GAST: ‚ÄÚI SENT ECCE HOMO BACK TO C. G. NAUMANN DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY AFTER LAYING IT ONCE MORE ON THE GOLD SCALES FROM THE FIRST TO THE LAST WORD TO SET MY CONSCIENCE FINALLY AT REST.‚ÄÙ

ALL THIS INFORMATION WAS GIVEN BY PROFESSOR RAOUL RICHTER IN HIS LONG POSTSCRIPT TO THE FIRST EDITION OF 1908, AND RICHTER ALSO DESCRIBED THE MANUSCRIPT: ‚ÄÚTHE MANUSCRIPT IS WRITTEN CLEARLY AND CLEANLY FROM BEGINNING TO END, SO THAT EVEN EVERY UNTRAINED PERSON CAN READ IT QUICKLY ON THE WHOLE, WITHOUT TROUBLE. CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE EITHER BY STRIKING THINGS OUT (WITH PENCIL OR INK) OR BY PASTING THINGS OVER. IN BOTH CASES THE EDITOR [RICHTER] HAS COPIED THE ORIGINAL VERSION IN ORDER TO HELP PROVIDE A BASIS FOR A LATER CRITICAL EDITION. FOR THAT, AMPLE USE WOULD ALSO HAVE TO BE MADE OF THE DRAFTS AND VARIANTS FOUND IN THE THREE OCTAVO NOTEBOOKS (‚Ä¶)3 AND SOME SEPARATE SHEETS. NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CORRECTIONS IN THE MANUSCRIPT HAVE BEEN ENTERED WITH SCRUPULOUS EXACTNESS; WHERE, OWING TO LACK OF SPACE, SOME ADDITIONS HAD TO BE WRITTEN IN MINIATURE SCRIPT, THEY ARE LITTLE GRAPHIC MASTERPIECES: SO READABLE IS EVERY LETTER, AND SO EXACTLY IS THE BRACKET OF INSERTION DRAWN ABOVE THE LINE ‚Ä¶ SLIPS THAT AFFECT THE SPELLING OR GRAMMAR ARE VERY RARE AND PROBABLY RARER THAN IN THE AVERAGE MANUSCRIPT SUBMITTED TO A PRINTER‚ÄÙ (P. 146).

NEITHER RICHTER‚ÄÔS PROBITY NOR THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE LETTERS I HAVE CITED, AND OF ANY NUMBER OF OTHERS THAT CORROBORATE THEM, HAS EVER BEEN QUESTIONED. PODACH SIMPLY IGNORES ALL OF THIS. STILL, TWO DEPARTURES OF HIS VERSION FROM THE TRADITIONAL ONES OUGHT TO BE MENTIONED HERE. FIRST, HE OMITS SECTION 7 OF THE SECOND CHAPTER, WHICH CONTAINS NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS WELL-KNOWN POEM THAT IS SOMETIMES CALLED ‚ÄÚVENICE,‚ÄÙ SOMETIMES ‚ÄÚGONDOLA SONG.‚ÄÙ PODACH PRINTS THIS SECTION UNDER THE TITLE ‚ÄÚINTERMEZZO,‚ÄÙ AFTER THE SECOND SECTION OF NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER. THIS IS UNDERSTANDABLE, FOR THAT IS WHERE IT APPEARED IN THE UNPUBLISHED FIRST PRINTING OF THE LATTER BOOK (1889; I HAVE A COPY OF THAT), THOUGH NOT IN ANY PUBLISHED VERSION. BUT ON DECEMBER 20 NIETZSCHE SENT HIS PUBLISHER A POSTCARD: ‚ÄÚI HAVE SENT YOU A SINGLE SHEET WITH THE TITLE ‚ÄÒINTERMEZZO,‚ÄÔ WITH THE REQUEST TO INSERT IT IN N. CONTRA W. NOW LET US RATHER INSERT IT IN ECCE, FOR WHICH IT WAS INTENDED ORIGINALLY[!]‚ÄÎIN THE SECOND CHAPTER (WHY I AM SO CLEVER), AS SECTION 5 [SIC]. THE FOLLOWING NUMBERS WILL HAVE TO BE CHANGED ACCORDINGLY. THE TITLE ‚ÄÒINTERMEZZO,‚ÄÔ OF COURSE, GOES.‚ÄÙ TWO DAYS LATER NIETZSCHE WROTE GAST SIMILARLY. BUT A FEW DAYS LATER HE RECEIVED PROOFS OF NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER THAT NATURALLY STILL INCLUDED THIS SECTION, AND HE DID NOT DELETE IT BUT MADE SOME SLIGHT CORRECTIONS IN IT. RICHTER PRINTED IT IN HIS EDITION OF ECCE HOMO, WITH THE CORRECTIONS NIETZSCHE HAD MADE IN THE PROOFS. PODACH MENTIONS NONE OF THIS BUT SAYS SIMPLY THAT GAST, ‚ÄÚFOR HIS OWN GLORY AND THE ENHANCEMENT OF ECCE HOMO, EMBODIED THE ‚ÄÒINTERMEZZO‚ÄÔ PRINTED IN NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER IN THE MANUSCRIPT‚ÄÙ. WHILE THIS IS IN KEEPING WITH THE TENOR OF PODACH‚ÄÔS BOOK, IT SEEMS SENSIBLE TO ME TO INCLUDE THIS SECTION IN ECCE HOMO, IN KEEPING WITH ALL PREVIOUS EDITIONS EXCEPT PODACH‚ÄÔS.

FINALLY, AT THE END OF ECCE HOMO, PODACH PRINTS A THREE-PAGE POEM ENTITLED ‚ÄÚRUHM UND EWIGKEIT‚ÄÙ (FAME AND ETERNITY). HERE HE FOLLOWS RICHTER‚ÄÔS EDITION, WHILE ALL SUBSEQUENT EDITIONS HAVE OMITTED THE POEM. THIS DID NOT INVOLVE ANY SUPPRESSION, ALTHOUGH PODACH IS VERY SCORNFUL OF ALL WHO HAVE OMITTED IT AT THIS POINT: THE POEM HAS USUALLY BEEN INCLUDED IN THE SO-CALLED DIONYSUS DITHYRAMBS AND IS READILY AVAILABLE IN VOLUMES CONTAINING NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS POEMS. PODACH CONSIDERS IT IMPORTANT‚ÄÎIT IS NOT CLEAR WHY OR FOR WHAT‚ÄÎTHAT NIETZSCHE WANTED TO CONCLUDE ALL OF HIS LAST WORKS WITH POEMS. BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE LAST TWO BOOKS HE SAW THROUGH THE PRESS, THE CASE OF WAGNER AND THE TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS, DID NOT END WITH POEMS; NEITHER DID THE ANTICHRIST; AND AS FOR NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER AND ECCE HOMO, IN HIS LAST COMMUNICATIONS TO HIS PUBLISHER, NIETZSCHE ASKED NAUMANN JANUARY 1, 1889, TO RETURN ONE FINAL POEM, AND JANUARY 2, 1889, TO RETURN BOTH. THAT HE DID NOT WANT THEM PUBLISHED IN THEIR PRESENT FORM AT THE END OF THESE BOOKS SEEMS CLEAR; THAT HE WOULD HAVE REVISED THEM, IF HE HAD NOT COLLAPSED ON JANUARY 3, IS POSSIBLE. BUT IT IS NO LESS POSSIBLE AND ACTUALLY MORE LIKELY, I THINK, THAT HE REALIZED THAT THE BOOKS WOULD BE BETTER WITHOUT THESE POEMS.

AFTER NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS COLLAPSE, HIS FAMILY DECIDED NOT TO PUBLISH ANY FURTHER BOOKS BY HIM. THE TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS DID APPEAR, AS SCHEDULED, IN JANUARY 1889, BUT THE THREE BOOKS WRITTEN AFTER THAT WERE HELD UP. IN 1891 THE FOURTH PART OF THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA WAS PRINTED, TOGETHER WITH THE DIONYSUS DITHYRAMBS‚ÄÎAND PUBLISHED IN 1892. BY 1895 THERE WAS SUFFICIENT INTEREST IN NIETZSCHE TO INCLUDE BOTH THE ANTICHRIST AND NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER IN VOLUME VIII OF A NEW EDITION OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS WORKS. BUT ECCE HOMO WAS HELD BACK, PERHAPS PARTLY BECAUSE IT MIGHT COMPROMISE NIETZSCHE, PARTLY BECAUSE HIS SISTER FOUND IT USEFUL TO QUOTE FROM NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS SELF-INTERPRETATIONS WHEN SHE WROTE PREFACES FOR NEW EDITIONS OF HIS BOOKS. AS LONG AS SHE KNEW ECCE HOMO AND THE PUBLIC DID NOT, HER BIOGRAPHIES OF HER BROTHER AS WELL AS HER OCCASIONAL JOURNALISTIC PIECES HAD A SPECIAL AUTHORITY.

FINALLY, IN 1908 THE BOOK APPEARED IN AN EXPENSIVE LIMITED EDITION OF 1250 COPIES. IT WAS NOT BROUGHT OUT BY A PUBLISHER WHO HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSOCIATED WITH NIETZSCHE, BUT BY THE INSEL VERLAG; AND THE TITLE, BINDING, AND ORNAMENTS HAD ALL BEEN DESIGNED BY HENRY VAN DE VELDE IN THE JUGENDSTIL OF THAT TIME. THERE IS NO ENGLISH WORD FOR THAT STYLE: ONE USES THE FRENCH PHRASE ART NOUVEAU. NIETZSCHE, WHO HAD WRITTEN GAST, NOVEMBER 26, 1888, THAT HE WANTED ECCE TO BE DESIGNED JUST LIKE TWILIGHT‚ÄÎTHAT IS, VERY SIMPLY, WITH CLEAR PRINT AND WIDE MARGINS AND NOTHING TO DISTRACT THE EYE FROM THE TEXT‚ÄÎWOULD SURELY HAVE FOUND THE BOOK HIDEOUS. BUT RICHTER‚ÄÔS POSTSCRIPT WAS DIGNIFIED AND INFORMATIVE.

TWO YEARS LATER, IN 1910, ECCE HOMO WAS INCLUDED IN THE NEW VOLUME XV OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS WORKS, WHICH ALONG WITH VOLUME XVI (1911) CONTAINED A GREATLY ENLARGED AND ENTIRELY REMODELED VERSION OF THE WILL TO POWER AND REPLACED THE OLD VOLUME XV (1901), WHICH HAD CONTAINED THE FIRST EDITION OF THE WILL TO POWER. MANY LIBRARIES ACQUIRED ONLY VOLUME XVI, ADDING IT TO THEIR OLD SETS: AS A RESULT, MANY SETS OF THE SO-CALLED GROSSOKTAV EDITION4 OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS WORKS LACK ECCE HOMO. BUT HENCEFORTH ECCE WAS INCLUDED IN EDITIONS OF THE WORKS AND NO LONGER HARD TO COME BY. AND ALL EDITIONS OF THE BOOK, EXCEPT FOR PODACH‚ÄÔS, FOLLOWED THE FIRST EDITION, EXCEPT THAT THEY OMITTED THE POEM AT THE END.

THE PRESENT TRANSLATION FOLLOWS THE STANDARD EDITIONS, BUT THE NOTES AND APPENDIX ALSO OFFER PREVIOUSLY UNTRANSLATED VARIANTS AND PASSAGES FROM DRAFTS, ALONG WITH OTHER INFORMATION AND COMMENTS NOT PREVIOUSLY FOUND IN ANY EDITION IN ANY LANGUAGE. IN A WAY, ALL THIS APPARATUS WEIGHS DOWN A-BOOK WRITTEN WITH LIGHT FEET; BUT ECCE IS NOT EASILY ACCESSIBLE, AND ON A FIRST OR SECOND READING THE COMMENTARY MAY PROVE HELPFUL. THE FORM IN WHICH IT IS OFFERED SHOULD MAKE IT EASY TO REREAD ECCE HOMO STRAIGHT THROUGH, WITHOUT ANY EDITORIAL INTERRUPTIONS.

PERHAPS ONE OR ANOTHER READER OF THE BOOK WILL REACT IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO ‚ÄÚNAPOLEON‚ÄÔS SURPRISE WHEN HE CAME TO SEE GOETHE: IT SHOWS WHAT PEOPLE HAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE ‚ÄÒGERMAR SPIRIT‚ÄÔ FOR CENTURIES. ‚ÄÒVOIL√† UN HOMME!‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ5

HOW ONE BECOMES WHAT ONE IS





PREFACE





1


SEEING THAT BEFORE LONG I MUST CONFRONT HUMANITY WITH THE MOST DIFFICULT DEMAND EVER MADE OF IT, IT SEEMS INDISPENSABLE TO ME TO SAY WHO I AM. REALLY, ONE SHOULD KNOW IT, FOR I HAVE NOT LEFT MYSELF ‚ÄÚWITHOUT TESTIMONY.‚ÄÙ BUT THE DISPROPORTION BETWEEN THE GREATNESS OF MY TASK AND THE SMALLNESS OF MY CONTEMPORARIES HAS FOUND EXPRESSION IN THE FACT THAT ONE HAS NEITHER HEARD NOR EVEN SEEN ME. I LIVE ON MY OWN CREDIT; IT IS PERHAPS A MERE PREJUDICE THAT I LIVE.

I ONLY NEED TO SPEAK WITH ONE OF THE ‚ÄÚEDUCATED‚ÄÙ WHO COME TO THE UPPER ENGADINE1 FOR THE SUMMER, AND I AM CONVINCED THAT I DO NOT LIVE.

UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE A DUTY AGAINST WHICH MY HABITS, EVEN MORE THE PRIDE OF MY INSTINCTS, REVOLT AT BOTTOM‚ÄÎNAMELY, TO SAY: HEAR ME! FOR I AM SUCH AND SUCH A PERSON. ABOVE ALL, DO NOT MISTAKE ME FOR SOMEONE ELSE.





2


I AM, FOR EXAMPLE, BY NO MEANS A BOGEY, OR A MORALISTIC MONSTER‚ÄÎI AM ACTUALLY THE VERY OPPOSITE OF THE TYPE OF MAN WHO SO FAR HAS BEEN REVERED AS VIRTUOUS. BETWEEN OURSELVES, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT PRECISELY THIS IS PART OF MY PRIDE. I AM A DISCIPLE OF THE PHILOSOPHER DIONYSUS; I SHOULD PREFER TO BE EVEN A SATYR TO BEING A SAINT. BUT ONE SHOULD REALLY READ THIS ESSAY. PERHAPS I HAVE SUCCEEDED; PERHAPS THIS ESSAY HAD NO OTHER MEANING THAN TO GIVE EXPRESSION TO THIS CONTRAST IN A CHEERFUL AND PHILANTHROPIC MANNER.

THE LAST THING I SHOULD PROMISE WOULD BE TO ‚ÄÚIMPROVE‚ÄÙ MANKIND.2 NO NEW IDOLS ARE ERECTED BY ME; LET THE OLD ONES LEARN WHAT FEET OF CLAY MEAN. OVERTHROWING IDOLS (MY WORD FOR ‚ÄÚIDEALS‚ÄÙ)‚ÄÎTHAT COMES CLOSER TO BEING PART OF MY CRAFT. ONE HAS DEPRIVED REALITY OF ITS VALUE, ITS MEANING, ITS TRUTHFULNESS, TO PRECISELY THE EXTENT TO WHICH ONE HAS MENDACIOUSLY INVENTED AN IDEAL WORLD.

THE ‚ÄÚTRUE WORLD‚ÄÙ AND THE ‚ÄÚAPPARENT WORLD‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT MEANS: THE MENDACIOUSLY INVENTED WORLD AND REALITY.

THE LIE OF THE IDEAL HAS SO FAR BEEN THE CURSE ON REALITY; ON ACCOUNT OF IT, MANKIND ITSELF HAS BECOME MENDACIOUS AND FALSE DOWN TO ITS MOST FUNDAMENTAL INSTINCTS‚ÄÎTO THE POINT OF WORSHIPPING THE OPPOSITE VALUES OF THOSE WHICH ALONE WOULD GUARANTEE ITS HEALTH, ITS FUTURE, THE LOFTY RIGHT TO ITS FUTURE.

THOSE WHO CAN BREATHE THE AIR OF MY WRITINGS KNOW THAT IT IS AN AIR OF THE HEIGHTS, A STRONG AIR. ONE MUST BE MADE FOR IT. OTHERWISE THERE IS NO SMALL DANGER THAT ONE MAY CATCH COLD IN IT. THE ICE IS NEAR, THE SOLITUDE TREMENDOUS‚ÄÎBUT HOW CALMLY ALL THINGS LIE IN THE LIGHT! HOW FREELY ONE BREATHES! HOW MUCH ONE FEELS BENEATH ONESELF!

PHILOSOPHY, AS I HAVE SO FAR UNDERSTOOD AND LIVED IT, MEANS LIVING VOLUNTARILY AMONG ICE AND HIGH MOUNTAINS‚ÄÎSEEKING OUT EVERYTHING STRANGE AND QUESTIONABLE IN EXISTENCE, EVERYTHING SO FAR PLACED UNDER A BAN BY MORALITY. LONG EXPERIENCE, ACQUIRED IN THE COURSE OF SUCH WANDERINGS IN WHAT IS FORBIDDEN, TAUGHT ME TO REGARD THE CAUSES THAT SO FAR HAVE PROMPTED MORALIZING AND IDEALIZING IN A VERY DIFFERENT LIGHT FROM WHAT MAY SEEM DESIRABLE: THE HIDDEN HISTORY OF THE PHILOSOPHERS, THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE GREAT NAMES, CAME TO LIGHT FOR ME.

HOW MUCH TRUTH DOES A SPIRIT ENDURE, HOW MUCH TRUTH DOES IT DARE? MORE AND MORE THAT BECAME FOR ME THE REAL MEASURE OF VALUE. ERROR (FAITH IN THE IDEAL) IS NOT BLINDNESS, ERROR IS COWARDICE.

EVERY ATTAINMENT, EVERY STEP FORWARD IN KNOWLEDGE, FOLLOWS FROM COURAGE, FROM HARDNESS AGAINST ONESELF, FROM CLEANLINESS IN RELATION TO ONESELF.

I DO NOT REFUTE IDEALS, I MERELY PUT ON GLOVES BEFORE THEM.

NITIMUR IN VETITUM:3 IN THIS SIGN MY PHILOSOPHY WILL TRIUMPH ONE DAY, FOR WHAT ONE HAS FORBIDDEN SO FAR AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE HAS ALWAYS BEEN‚ÄÎTRUTH ALONE.

AMONG MY WRITINGS MY ZARATHUSTRA STANDS TO MY MIND BY ITSELF. WITH THAT I HAVE GIVEN MANKIND THE GREATEST PRESENT THAT HAS EVER BEEN MADE TO IT SO FAR. THIS BOOK, WITH A VOICE BRIDGING CENTURIES, IS NOT ONLY THE HIGHEST BOOK THERE IS, THE BOOK THAT IS TRULY CHARACTERIZED BY THE AIR OF THE HEIGHTS‚ÄÎTHE WHOLE FACT OF MAN LIES BENEATH IT AT A TREMENDOUS DISTANCE‚ÄÎIT IS ALSO THE DEEPEST, BORN OUT OF THE INNERMOST WEALTH OF TRUTH, AN INEXHAUSTIBLE WELL TO WHICH NO PAIL DESCENDS WITHOUT COMING UP AGAIN FILLED WITH GOLD AND GOODNESS. HERE NO ‚ÄÚPROPHET‚ÄÙ IS SPEAKING, NONE OF THOSE GRUESOME HYBRIDS OF SICKNESS AND WILL TO POWER WHOM PEOPLE CALL FOUNDERS OF RELIGIONS. ABOVE ALL, ONE MUST HEAR ARIGHT THE TONE THAT COMES FROM THIS MOUTH, THE HALCYON TONE, LEST ONE SHOULD DO WRETCHED INJUSTICE TO THE MEANING OF ITS WISDOM.

‚ÄÚIT IS THE STILLEST WORDS THAT BRING ON THE STORM. THOUGHTS THAT COME ON DOVES‚ÄÔ FEET GUIDE THE WORLD.‚ÄÙ4

THE FIGS ARE FALLING FROM THE TREES; THEY ARE GOOD AND SWEET; AND, AS THEY FALL, THEIR RED SKIN BURSTS. I AM A NORTH WIND TO RIPE FIGS.

THUS, LIKE FIGS, THESE TEACHINGS FALL TO YOU, MY FRIENDS: NOW CONSUME THEIR JUICE AND THEIR SWEET MEAT. IT IS FALL AROUND US, AND PURE SKY AND AFTERNOON.5



IT IS NO FANATIC THAT SPEAKS HERE; THIS IS NOT ‚ÄÚPREACHING;‚ÄÙ NO FAITH IS DEMANDED HERE: FROM AN INFINITE ABUNDANCE OF LIGHT AND DEPTH OF HAPPINESS FALLS DROP UPON DROP, WORD UPON WORD: THE TEMPO OF THESE SPEECHES IS A TENDER ADAGIO. SUCH THINGS REACH ONLY THE MOST SELECT. IT IS A PRIVILEGE WITHOUT EQUAL TO BE A LISTENER HERE. NOBODY IS FREE TO HAVE EARS FOR ZARATHUSTRA.

IS NOT ZARATHUSTRA IN VIEW OF ALL THIS A SEDUCER?‚ÄÎBUT WHAT DOES HE HIMSELF SAY, AS HE RETURNS AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME TO HIS SOLITUDE? PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE OF EVERYTHING THAT ANY ‚ÄÚSAGE,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚSAINT,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚWORLD-REDEEMER,‚ÄÙ OR ANY OTHER DECADENT WOULD SAY IN SUCH A CASE.‚ÄÎNOT ONLY DOES HE SPEAK DIFFERENTLY, HE ALSO IS DIFFERENT.‚ÄÎ

NOW I GO ALONE, MY DISCIPLES, YOU, TOO, GO NOW, ALONE. THUS I WANT IT.

GO AWAY FROM ME AND RESIST ZARATHUSTRA! AND EVEN BETTER: BE ASHAMED OF HIM! PERHAPS HE DECEIVED YOU.

THE MAN OF KNOWLEDGE MUST NOT ONLY LOVE HIS ENEMIES, HE MUST ALSO BE ABLE TO HATE HIS FRIENDS.

ONE REPAYS A TEACHER BADLY IF ONE ALWAYS REMAINS NOTHING BUT A PUPIL. AND WHY DO YOU NOT WANT TO PLUCK AT MY WREATH?

YOU REVERE ME; BUT WHAT IF YOUR REVERENCE TUMBLES ONE DAY? BEWARE LEST A STATUE SLAY YOU.

YOU SAY THAT YOU BELIEVE IN ZARATHUSTRA? BUT WHAT MATTERS ZARATHUSTRA? YOU ARE MY BELIEVERS‚ÄÎBUT WHAT MATTER ALL BELIEVERS?

YOU HAD NOT YET SOUGHT YOURSELVES; AND YOU FOUND ME. THUS DO ALL BELIEVERS; THEREFORE ALL FAITH AMOUNTS TO SO LITTLE.

NOW I BID YOU LOSE ME AND FIND YOURSELVES; AND ONLY WHEN YOU HAVE ALL DENIED ME WILL I RETURN TO YOU.6

ON THIS PERFECT DAY, WHEN EVERYTHING IS RIPENING AND NOT ONLY THE GRAPE TURNS BROWN, THE EYE OF THE SUN JUST FELL UPON MY LIFE: I LOOKED BACK, I LOOKED FORWARD, AND NEVER SAW SO MANY AND SUCH GOOD THINGS AT ONCE. IT WAS NOT FOR NOTHING THAT I BURIED MY FORTY-FOURTH YEAR TODAY; I HAD THE RIGHT TO BURY IT; WHATEVER WAS LIFE IN IT HAS BEEN SAVED, IS IMMORTAL.

WHY I AM SO WISE





L


THE GOOD FORTUNE OF MY EXISTENCE, ITS UNIQUENESS PERHAPS, LIES IN ITS FATALITY: I AM, TO EXPRESS IT IN THE FORM OF A RIDDLE, ALREADY DEAD AS MY FATHER, WHILE AS MY MOTHER I AM STILL LIVING AND BECOMING OLD. THIS DUAL DESCENT, AS IT WERE, BOTH FROM THE HIGHEST AND THE LOWEST RUNG ON THE LADDER OF LIFE, AT THE SAME TIME A DECADENT AND A BEGINNING‚ÄÎTHIS, IF ANYTHING, EXPLAINS THAT NEUTRALITY, THAT FREEDOM FROM ALL PARTIALITY IN RELATION TO THE TOTAL PROBLEM OF LIFE, THAT PERHAPS DISTINGUISHES ME. I HAVE A SUBTLER SENSE OF SMELL FOR THE SIGNS OF ASCENT AND DECLINE THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING BEFORE ME; I AM THE TEACHER PAR EXCELLENCE FOR THIS‚ÄÎI KNOW BOTH, I AM BOTH.

MY FATHER DIED AT THE AGE OF THIRTY-SIX: HE WAS DELICATE, KIND, AND MORBID, AS A BEING THAT IS DESTINED MERELY TO PASS BY‚ÄÎMORE A GRACIOUS MEMORY OF LIFE THAN LIFE ITSELF. IN THE SAME YEAR IN WHICH HIS LIFE WENT DOWNWARD, MINE, TOO, WENT DOWNWARD: AT THIRTY-SIX, I REACHED THE LOWEST POINT OF MY VITALITY‚ÄÎI STILL LIVED, BUT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE THREE STEPS AHEAD. THEN‚ÄÎIT WAS 1879‚ÄÎI RETIRED FROM MY PROFESSORSHIP AT BASEL, SPENT THE SUMMER IN ST. MORITZ LIKE A SHADOW, AND THE NEXT WINTER, THAN WHICH NOT ONE IN MY LIFE HAS BEEN POORER IN SUNSHINE, IN NAUMBURG AS A. SHADOW. THIS WAS MY MINIMUM: THE WANDERER AND HIS SHADOW ORIGINATED AT THIS TIME. DOUBTLESS, I THEN KNEW ABOUT SHADOWS.

THE FOLLOWING WINTER, MY FIRST ONE IN GENOA, THAT SWEETENING AND SPIRITUALIZATION WHICH IS ALMOST INSEPARABLY CONNECTED WITH AN EXTREME POVERTY OF BLOOD AND MUSCLE, PRODUCED THE DAWN. THE PERFECT BRIGHTNESS AND CHEERFULNESS, EVEN EXUBERANCE OF THE SPIRIT, REFLECTED IN THIS WORK, IS COMPATIBLE IN MY CASE NOT ONLY WITH THE MOST PROFOUND PHYSIOLOGICAL WEAKNESS, BUT EVEN WITH AN EXCESS OF PAIN. IN THE MIDST OF THE TORMENTS THAT GO WITH AN UNINTERRUPTED THREE-DAY MIGRAINE, ACCOMPANIED BY LABORIOUS VOMITING OF PHLEGM, I POSSESSED A DIALECTICIAN‚ÄÔS CLARITY PAR EXCELLENCE AND THOUGHT THROUGH WITH VERY COLD BLOOD MATTERS FOR WHICH UNDER HEALTHIER CIRCUMSTANCES I AM NOT MOUNTAIN-CLIMBER, NOT SUBTLE, NOT COLD ENOUGH. MY READERS KNOW PERHAPS IN WHAT WAY I CONSIDER DIALECTIC AS A SYMPTOM OF DECADENCE; FOR EXAMPLE IN THE MOST FAMOUS CASE, THE CASE OF SOCRATES.

ALL PATHOLOGICAL DISTURBANCES OF THE INTELLECT, EVEN THAT HALF-NUMB STATE THAT FOLLOWS FEVER, HAVE REMAINED ENTIRELY FOREIGN TO ME TO THIS DAY; AND I HAD TO DO RESEARCH TO FIND OUT ABOUT THEIR NATURE AND FREQUENCY. MY BLOOD MOVES SLOWLY. NOBODY HAS EVER DISCOVERED ANY FEVER IN ME. A PHYSICIAN WHO TREATED ME FOR SOME TIME AS IF MY NERVES WERE SICK FINALLY SAID: ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS NOT YOUR NERVES, IT IS RATHER I THAT AM NERVOUS.‚ÄÙ THERE IS ALTOGETHER NO SIGN OF ANY LOCAL DEGENERATION; NO ORGANICALLY CONDITIONED STOMACH COMPLAINT, HOWEVER PROFOUND THE WEAKNESS OF MY GASTRIC SYSTEM MAY BE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF OVER-ALL EXHAUSTION. MY EYE TROUBLE, TOO, THOUGH AT TIMES DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO BLINDNESS, IS ONLY A CONSEQUENCE AND NOT A CAUSE: WITH EVERY INCREASE IN VITALITY MY ABILITY TO SEE HAS ALSO INCREASED AGAIN.

A LONG, ALL TOO LONG, SERIES OF YEARS SIGNIFIES RECOVERY FOR ME; UNFORTUNATELY IT ALSO SIGNIFIES RELAPSE, DECAY, THE PERIODICITY OF A KIND OF DECADENCE. NEED I SAY AFTER ALL THIS THAT IN QUESTIONS OF DECADENCE I AM EXPERIENCED? I HAVE SPELLED THEM FORWARD AND BACKWARD. EVEN THAT FILIGREE ART OF GRASPING AND COMPREHENDING IN GENERAL, THOSE FINGERS FOR NUANCES, THAT PSYCHOLOGY OF ‚ÄÚLOOKING AROUND THE CORNER,‚ÄÙ AND WHATEVER ELSE IS CHARACTERISTIC OF ME, WAS LEARNED ONLY THEN, IS THE TRUE PRESENT OF THOSE DAYS IN WHICH EVERYTHING IN ME BECAME SUBTLER‚ÄÎOBSERVATION ITSELF AS WELL AS ALL ORGANS OF OBSERVATION. LOOKING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE SICK TOWARD HEALTHIER CONCEPTS AND VALUES AND, CONVERSELY, LOOKING AGAIN FROM THE FULLNESS AND SELF-ASSURANCE OF A RICH LIFE DOWN INTO THE SECRET WORK OF THE INSTINCT OF DECADENCE‚ÄÎIN THIS I HAVE HAD THE LONGEST TRAINING, MY TRUEST EXPERIENCE; IF IN ANYTHING, I BECAME MASTER IN THIS. NOW I KNOW HOW, HAVE THE KNOW-HOW, TO REVERSE PERSPECTIVES: THE FIRST REASON WHY A ‚ÄÚREVALUATION OF VALUES‚ÄÙ IS PERHAPS POSSIBLE FOR ME ALONE.

APART FROM THE FACT THAT I AM A DECADENT, I AM ALSO THE OPPOSITE. MY PROOF FOR THIS IS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT I HAVE ALWAYS INSTINCTIVELY CHOSEN THE RIGHT MEANS AGAINST WRETCHED STATES; WHILE THE DECADENT TYPICALLY CHOOSES MEANS THAT ARE DISADVANTAGEOUS FOR HIM. AS SUMMA SUMMARUM,1 I WAS HEALTHY; AS AN ANGLE, AS A SPECIALTY, I WAS A DECADENT. THE ENERGY TO CHOOSE ABSOLUTE SOLITUDE AND LEAVE THE LIFE TO WHICH I HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED; THE INSISTENCE ON NOT ALLOWING MYSELF ANY LONGER TO BE CARED FOR, WAITED ON, AND DOCTORED‚ÄÎTHAT BETRAYED AN ABSOLUTE INSTINCTIVE CERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT WAS NEEDED ABOVE ALL AT THAT TIME. I TOOK MYSELF IN HAND, I MADE MYSELF HEALTHY AGAIN: THE CONDITION FOR THIS‚ÄÎEVERY PHYSIOLOGIST WOULD ADMIT THAT‚ÄÎIS THAT ONE BE HEALTHY AT BOTTOM. A TYPICALLY MORBID BEING CANNOT BECOME HEALTHY, MUCH LESS MAKE ITSELF HEALTHY. FOR A TYPICALLY HEALTHY PERSON, CONVERSELY, BEING SICK CAN EVEN BECOME AN ENERGETIC STIMULUS FOR LIFE, FOR LIVING MORE. THIS, IN FACT, IS HOW THAT LONG PERIOD OF SICKNESS APPEARS TO ME NOW: AS IT WERE, I DISCOVERED LIFE ANEW, INCLUDING MYSELF; I TASTED ALL GOOD AND EVEN LITTLE THINGS, AS OTHERS CANNOT EASILY TASTE THEM‚ÄÎI TURNED MY WILL TO HEALTH, TO LIFE, INTO A PHILOSOPHY.

FOR IT SHOULD BE NOTED: IT WAS DURING THE YEARS OF MY LOWEST VITALITY THAT I CEASED TO BE A PESSIMIST; THE INSTINCT OF SELF-RESTORATION FORBADE ME A PHILOSOPHY OF POVERTY AND DISCOURAGEMENT.

WHAT IS IT, FUNDAMENTALLY, THAT ALLOWS US TO RECOGNIZE WHO HAS TURNED OUT WELL? THAT A WELL-TURNED-OUT PERSON PLEASES OUR SENSES, THAT HE IS CARVED FROM WOOD THAT IS HARD, DELICATE, AND AT THE SAME TIME SMELLS GOOD. HE HAS A TASTE ONLY FOR WHAT IS GOOD FOR HIM; HIS PLEASURE, HIS DELIGHT CEASE WHERE THE MEASURE OF WHAT IS GOOD FOR HIM IS TRANSGRESSED. HE GUESSES WHAT REMEDIES AVAIL AGAINST WHAT IS HARMFUL; HE EXPLOITS BAD ACCIDENTS TO HIS ADVANTAGE; WHAT DOES NOT KILL HIM MAKES HIM STRONGER.2 INSTINCTIVELY, HE COLLECTS FROM EVERYTHING HE SEES, HEARS, LIVES THROUGH, HIS SUM: HE IS A PRINCIPLE OF SELECTION, HE DISCARDS MUCH. HE IS ALWAYS IN HIS OWN COMPANY, WHETHER HE ASSOCIATES WITH BOOKS, HUMAN BEINGS, OR LANDSCAPES: HE HONORS BY CHOOSING, BY ADMITTING, BY TRUSTING. HE REACTS SLOWLY TO ALL KINDS OF STIMULI, WITH THAT SLOWNESS WHICH LONG CAUTION AND DELIBERATE PRIDE HAVE BRED IN HIM: HE EXAMINES THE STIMULUS THAT APPROACHES HIM, HE IS FAR FROM MEETING IT HALFWAY. HE BELIEVES NEITHER IN ‚ÄÚMISFORTUNE‚ÄÙ NOR IN ‚ÄÚGUILT‚ÄÙ: HE COMES TO TERMS WITH HIMSELF, WITH OTHERS; HE KNOWS HOW TO FORGET‚ÄÎHE IS STRONG ENOUGH; HENCE EVERYTHING MUST TURN OUT FOR HIS BEST.

WELL THEN, I AM THE OPPOSITE OF A DECADENT, FOR I HAVE JUST DESCRIBED MYSELF.

THIS DUAL SERIES OF EXPERIENCES, THIS ACCESS TO APPARENTLY SEPARATE WORLDS, IS REPEATED IN MY NATURE IN EVERY RESPECT: I AM A DOPPELG√§NGER, I HAVE A ‚ÄÚSECOND‚ÄÙ FACE IN ADDITION TO THE FIRST. AND PERHAPS ALSO A THIRD.

EVEN BY VIRTUE OF MY DESCENT, I AM GRANTED AN EYE BEYOND ALL MERELY LOCAL, MERELY NATIONALLY CONDITIONED PERSPECTIVES; IT IS NOT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO BE A ‚ÄÚGOOD EUROPEAN.‚ÄÙ ON THE OTHER HAND, I AM PERHAPS MORE GERMAN THAN PRESENT-DAY GERMANS, MERE CITIZENS OF THE GERMAN REICH, COULD POSSIBLY BE‚ÄÎI, THE LAST ANTI-POLITICAL GERMAN. AND YET MY ANCESTORS WERE POLISH NOBLEMEN: I HAVE MANY RACIAL INSTINCTS IN MY BODY FROM THAT SOURCE‚ÄÎWHO KNOWS? IN THE END PERHAPS EVEN THE LIBERUM VETO.1

1UNRESTRICTED VETO‚ÄÎONE OF THE TRADITIONAL PRIVILEGES OF THE MEMBERS OF THE POLISH DIET.

DURING THE NAZI PERIOD, ONE OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS RELATIVES, MAX OEHLER, A RETIRED MAJOR, WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO PROVE THAT NIETZSCHE HAD BEEN RACIALLY PURE: ‚ÄÚNIETZSCHES ANGEBLICHE POLNISCHE HERKUNFT‚ÄÙ (N‚ÄÔS ALLEGED POLISH DESCENT) IN OSTDEUTSCHE MONATSHEFTE, 18 (1938), 679-82, AND NIETZSCHES AHNENTAFEL (N‚ÄÔS PEDIGREE), WEIMAR, 1938.

WHEN I CONSIDER HOW OFTEN I AM ADDRESSED AS A POLE WHEN I TRAVEL, EVEN BY POLES THEMSELVES, AND HOW RARELY I AM TAKEN FOR A GERMAN, IT MIGHT SEEM THAT I HAVE BEEN MERELY EXTERNALLY SPRINKLED WITH WHAT IS GERMAN. YET MY MOTHER, FRANZISKA OEHLER, IS AT ANY RATE SOMETHING VERY GERMAN; DITTO, MY GRANDMOTHER ON MY FATHER‚ÄÔS SIDE, ERDMUTHE KRAUSE. THE LATTER LIVED ALL HER YOUTH IN THE MIDDLE OF GOOD OLD WEIMAR, NOT WITHOUT SOME CONNECTION WITH THE CIRCLE OF GOETHE. HER BROTHER, THE PROFESSOR OF THEOLOGY KRAUSE IN K√∂NIGSBERG, WAS CALLED TO WEIMAR AS GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT AFTER HERDER‚ÄÔS DEATH. IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT HER MOTHER, MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER, IS MENTIONED IN THE DIARY OF THE YOUNG GOETHE UNDER THE NAME OF ‚ÄÚMUTHGEN.‚ÄÙ HER SECOND MARRIAGE WAS WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT NIETZSCHE IN EILENBURG; AND IN THE GREAT WAR YEAR OF 1813, ON THE DAY THAT NAPOLEON ENTERED EILENBURG WITH HIS GENERAL STAFF, ON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER, SHE GAVE BIRTH. AS A SAXON, SHE WAS A GREAT ADMIRER OF NAPOLEON; IT COULD BE THAT I STILL AM, TOO. MY FATHER, BORN IN 1813, DIED IN 1849. BEFORE HE ACCEPTED THE PASTOR‚ÄÔS POSITION IN THE PARISH OF R√∂CKEN, NOT FAR FROM L√ºTZEN, HE LIVED FOR A FEW YEARS IN THE CASTLE OF ALTENBURG AND TAUGHT THE FOUR PRINCESSES THERE. HIS PUPILS ARE NOW THE QUEEN OF HANOVER, THE GRAND DUCHESS CONSTANTINE, THE GRAND DUCHESS OF ALTENBURG, AND THE PRINCESS THERESE OF SAXE-ALTENBURG. HE WAS FULL OF DEEP REVERENCE FOR THE PRUSSIAN KING FREDERICK WILLIAM IV, FROM WHOM HE HAD ALSO RECEIVED HIS PASTORAL POSITION; THE EVENTS OF 1848 GRIEVED HIM BEYOND ALL MEASURE. I MYSELF, BORN ON THE BIRTHDAY OF THE ABOVE NAMED KING, ON THE FIFTEENTH OF OCTOBER, RECEIVED, AS FITTING, THE HOHENZOLLERN NAME FRIEDRICH WILHELM. THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE ADVANTAGE TO THE CHOICE OF THIS DAY; MY BIRTHDAY WAS A HOLIDAY THROUGHOUT MY CHILDHOOD.

I CONSIDER IT A GREAT PRIVILEGE TO HAVE HAD SUCH A FATHER: IT EVEN SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS EXPLAINS WHATEVER ELSE I HAVE OF PRIVILEGES‚ÄÎNOT INCLUDING LIFE, THE GREAT YES TO LIFE. ABOVE ALL, THAT IT REQUIRES NO RESOLVE ON MY PART, BUT MERELY BIDING MY TIME, TO ENTER QUITE INVOLUNTARILY INTO A WORLD OF LOFTY AND DELICATE THINGS: I AM AT HOME THERE, MY INMOST PASSION BECOMES FREE ONLY THERE. THAT I HAVE ALMOST PAID WITH MY LIFE FOR THIS PRIVILEGE IS CERTAINLY NO UNFAIR TRADE.

IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING AT ALL OF MY ZARATHUSTRA ONE MUST PERHAPS BE SIMILARLY CONDITIONED AS I AM‚ÄÎWITH ONE FOOT BEYOND LIFE.





4


I HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE ART OF PREDISPOSING PEOPLE AGAINST ME‚ÄÎTHIS, TOO, I OWE TO MY INCOMPARABLE FATHER‚ÄÎEVEN WHEN IT SEEMED HIGHLY DESIRABLE TO ME. HOWEVER UN-CHRISTIAN THIS MAY SEEM, I AM NOT EVEN PREDISPOSED AGAINST MYSELF. YOU CAN TURN MY LIFE THIS WAY AND THAT, YOU WILL RARELY FIND TRACES, AND ACTUALLY ONLY ONCE, THAT ANYBODY FELT ILL WILL TOWARD ME‚ÄÎBUT PERHAPS RATHER TOO MANY TRACES OF GOOD WILL.

EVEN MY EXPERIENCES WITH PEOPLE WITH WHOM EVERYBODY HAS BAD EXPERIENCES BEAR WITNESS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, IN THEIR FAVOR: I TAME EVERY BEAR, I MAKE EVEN BUFFOONS BEHAVE THEMSELVES. DURING THE SEVEN YEARS THAT I TAUGHT GREEK IN THE SENIOR CLASS IN THE P√§DAGOGIUM IN BASEL, I NEVER HAD OCCASION TO PUNISH ANYONE; THE LAZIEST BOYS WORKED HARD. I AM ALWAYS EQUAL TO ACCIDENTS; I HAVE TO BE UNPREPARED TO BE MASTER OF MYSELF. LET THE INSTRUMENT BE WHAT IT MAY, LET IT BE AS OUT OF TUNE AS ONLY THE INSTRUMENT ‚ÄÚMAN‚ÄÙ CAN BE‚ÄÎI SHOULD HAVE TO BE SICK IF I SHOULD NOT SUCCEED IN GETTING OUT OF IT SOMETHING WORTH HEARING. AND HOW OFTEN HAVE I BEEN TOLD BY THE ‚ÄÚINSTRUMENTS‚ÄÙ THEMSELVES THAT THEY HAD NEVER HEARD THEMSELVES LIKE THAT.‚ÄÎMOST BEAUTIFULLY PERHAPS BY HEINRICH VON STEIN,1 WHO DIED SO UNPARDONABLY YOUNG. ONCE, AFTER HE HAD COURTEOUSLY REQUESTED PERMISSION, HE APPEARED FOR THREE DAYS IN SILS MARIA, EXPLAINING TO EVERYBODY THAT HE HAD NOT COME TO SEE THE ENGADINE. THIS EXCELLENT HUMAN BEING, WHO HAD WALKED INTO THE WAGNERIAN MORASS WITH ALL THE IMPETUOUS SIMPLICITY OF A PRUSSIAN JUNKER (AND IN ADDITION EVEN INTO THAT OF D√ºHRING!2), ACTED DURING THESE THREE DAYS LIKE ONE TRANSFORMED BY A TEMPEST OF FREEDOM, LIKE ONE WHO HAS SUDDENLY BEEN LIFTED TO HIS OWN HEIGHT AND ACQUIRED WINGS. I ALWAYS SAID TO HIM THAT THIS WAS DUE TO THE GOOD AIR UP HERE, THAT THIS HAPPENED TO EVERYBODY, THAT ONE WAS NOT FOR NOTHING SIX THOUSAND FEET ABOVE BAYREUTH3‚ÄÎBUT HE WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME. IF, IN SPITE OF THAT, SOME SMALL AND GREAT MISDEMEANORS HAVE BEEN COMMITTED AGAINST ME, ‚ÄÚTHE WILL‚ÄÙ CANNOT BE BLAMED FOR THIS, LEAST OF ALL ANY ILL WILL: SOONER COULD I COMPLAIN, AS I HAVE ALREADY SUGGESTED, OF THE GOOD WILL THAT HAS DONE NO SMALL MISCHIEF IN MY LIFE. MY EXPERIENCES ENTITLE ME TO BE QUITE GENERALLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE SO-CALLED ‚ÄÚSELFLESS‚ÄÙ DRIVES, OF ALL ‚ÄÚNEIGHBOR LOVE‚ÄÙ THAT IS READY TO GIVE ADVICE AND GO INTO ACTION. IT ALWAYS SEEMS A WEAKNESS TO ME, A PARTICULAR CASE OF BEING INCAPABLE OF RESISTING STIMULI: PITY IS CONSIDERED A VIRTUE ONLY AMONG DECADENTS. I REPROACH THOSE WHO ARE FULL OF PITY FOR EASILY LOSING A SENSE OF SHAME, OF RESPECT, OF SENSITIVITY FOR DISTANCES; BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, PITY BEGINS TO SMELL OF THE MOB AND BECOMES SCARCELY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM BAD MANNERS‚ÄÎAND SOMETIMES PITYING HANDS CAN INTERFERE IN A DOWNRIGHT DESTRUCTIVE MANNER IN A GREAT DESTINY, IN THE GROWING SOLITUDE OF ONE WOUNDED, IN A PRIVILEGED RIGHT TO HEAVY GUILT.

THE OVERCOMING OF PITY I COUNT AMONG THE NOBLE VIRTUES: AS ‚ÄÚZARATHUSTRA‚ÄÔS TEMPTATION‚ÄÙ I INVENTED A SITUATION IN WHICH A GREAT CRY OF DISTRESS REACHES HIM, AS PITY TRIES TO ATTACK HIM LIKE A FINAL SIN THAT WOULD ENTICE HIM AWAY FROM HIMSELF.4 TO REMAIN THE MASTER AT THIS POINT, TO KEEP THE EMINENCE OF ONE‚ÄÔS TASK UNDEFILED BY THE MANY LOWER AND MORE MYOPIC IMPULSES THAT ARE AT WORK IN SO-CALLED SELFLESS ACTIONS, THAT IS THE TEST, PERHAPS THE ULTIMATE TEST, WHICH A ZARATHUSTRA MUST PASS‚ÄÎHIS REAL PROOF OF STRENGTH.





5


AT ANOTHER POINT AS WELL, I AM MERELY MY FATHER ONCE MORE AND, AS IT WERE, HIS CONTINUED LIFE AFTER AN ALL-TOO-EARLY DEATH. LIKE EVERYONE WHO HAS NEVER LIVED AMONG HIS EQUALS AND WHO FINDS THE CONCEPT OF ‚ÄÚRETALIATION‚ÄÙ AS INACCESSIBLE AS, SAY, THE CONCEPT OF ‚ÄÚEQUAL RIGHTS,‚ÄÙ I FORBID MYSELF ALL COUNTERMEASURES, ALL PROTECTIVE MEASURES, AND, AS IS ONLY FAIR, ALSO ANY DEFENSE, ANY ‚ÄÚJUSTIFICATION,‚ÄÙ IN CASES WHEN SOME SMALL OR VERY GREAT FOLLY IS PERPETRATED AGAINST ME. MY KIND OF RETALIATION CONSISTS IN FOLLOWING UP THE STUPIDITY AS FAST AS POSSIBLE WITH SOME GOOD SENSE: THAT WAY ONE MAY ACTUALLY CATCH UP WITH IT.1 METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING, I SEND A BOX OF CONFECTIONS TO GET RID OF A PAINFUL STORY.

ONE NEEDS ONLY TO DO ME SOME WRONG, I ‚ÄÚREPAY‚ÄÙ IT‚ÄÎYOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT: SOON I FIND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EXPRESSING MY GRATITUDE TO THE ‚ÄÚEVIL-DOER‚ÄÙ (AT TIMES EVEN FOR HIS EVIL DEED)‚ÄÎOR TO ASK HIM FOR SOMETHING, WHICH CAN BE MORE OBLIGING THAN GIVING SOMETHING.

IT ALSO SEEMS TO ME THAT THE RUDEST WORD, THE RUDEST LETTER ARE STILL MORE BENIGN, MORE DECENT THAN SILENCE. THOSE WHO REMAIN SILENT ARE ALMOST ALWAYS LACKING IN DELICACY AND COURTESY OF THE HEART. SILENCE IS AN OBJECTION; SWALLOWING THINGS LEADS OF NECESSITY TO A BAD CHARACTER‚ÄÎIT EVEN UPSETS THE STOMACH. ALL WHO REMAIN SILENT ARE DYSPEPTIC.

YOU SEE, I DON‚ÄÔT WANT RUDENESS TO BE UNDERESTIMATED: IT IS BY FAR THE MOST HUMANE FORM OF CONTRADICTION AND, IN THE MIDST OF EFFEMINACY, ONE OF OUR FOREMOST VIRTUES.

IF ONE IS RICH ENOUGH FOR THIS, IT IS EVEN A GOOD FORTUNE TO BE IN THE WRONG. A GOD WHO WOULD COME TO EARTH MUST NOT DO ANYTHING EXCEPT WRONG: NOT TO TAKE THE PUNISHMENT UPON ONESELF BUT THE GUILT WOULD BE DIVINE.2

FREEDOM FROM RESSENTIMENT, ENLIGHTENMENT ABOUT RESSENTIMENT‚ÄÎWHO KNOWS HOW MUCH I AM ULTIMATELY INDEBTED, IN THIS RESPECT ALSO, TO MY PROTRACTED SICKNESS! THIS PROBLEM IS FAR FROM SIMPLE: ONE MUST HAVE EXPERIENCED IT FROM STRENGTH AS WELL AS FROM WEAKNESS. IF ANYTHING AT ALL MUST BE ADDUCED AGAINST BEING SICK AND BEING WEAK, IT IS THAT MAN‚ÄÔS REALLY REMEDIAL INSTINCT, HIS FIGHTING INSTINCT1 WEARS OUT. ONE CANNOT GET RID OF ANYTHING, ONE CANNOT GET OVER ANYTHING, ONE CANNOT REPEL ANYTHING‚ÄÎEVERYTHING HURTS. MEN AND THINGS OBTRUDE TOO CLOSELY; EXPERIENCES STRIKE ONE TOO DEEPLY; MEMORY BECOMES A FESTERING WOUND. SICKNESS ITSELF IS A KIND OF RESSENTIMENT.

AGAINST ALL THIS THE SICK PERSON HAS ONLY ONE GREAT REMEDY: I CALL IT RUSSIAN FATALISM, THAT FATALISM WITHOUT REVOLT WHICH IS EXEMPLIFIED BY A RUSSIAN SOLDIER WHO, FINDING A CAMPAIGN TOO STRENUOUS, FINALLY LIES DOWN IN THE SNOW. NO LONGER TO ACCEPT ANYTHING AT ALL, NO LONGER TO TAKE ANYTHING, NO LONGER TO ABSORB ANYTHING‚ÄÎTO CEASE REACTING ALTOGETHER.

THIS FATALISM IS NOT ALWAYS MERELY THE COURAGE TO DIE; IT CAN ALSO PRESERVE LIFE UNDER THE MOST PERILOUS CONDITIONS BY REDUCING THE METABOLISM, SLOWING IT DOWN, AS A KIND OF WILL TO HIBERNATE. CARRYING THIS LOGIC A FEW STEPS FURTHER, WE ARRIVE AT THE FAKIR WHO SLEEPS FOR WEEKS IN A GRAVE.

BECAUSE ONE WOULD USE ONESELF UP TOO QUICKLY IF ONE REACTED IN ANY WAY, ONE DOES NOT REACT AT ALL ANY MORE: THIS IS THE LOGIC. NOTHING BURNS ONE UP FASTER THAN THE AFFECTS OF RESSENTIMENT. ANGER, PATHOLOGICAL VULNERABILITY, IMPOTENT LUST FOR REVENGE, THIRST FOR REVENGE, POISON-MIXING IN ANY SENSE‚ÄÎNO REACTION COULD BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS FOR THE EXHAUSTED: SUCH AFFECTS INVOLVE A RAPID CONSUMPTION OF NERVOUS ENERGY, A PATHOLOGICAL INCREASE OF HARMFUL EXCRETIONS‚ÄÎFOR EXAMPLE, OF THE GALL BLADDER INTO THE STOMACH. RESSENTIMENT IS WHAT IS FORBIDDEN PAR EXCELLENCE FOR THE SICK‚ÄÎIT IS THEIR SPECIFIC EVIL‚ÄÎUNFORTUNATELY ALSO THEIR MOST NATURAL INCLINATION.

THIS WAS COMPREHENDED BY THAT PROFOUND PHYSIOLOGIST, THE BUDDHA. HIS ‚ÄÚRELIGION‚ÄÙ SHOULD RATHER BE CALLED A KIND OF HYGIENE, LEST IT BE CONFUSED WITH SUCH PITIABLE PHENOMENA AS CHRISTIANITY: ITS EFFECTIVENESS WAS MADE CONDITIONAL ON THE VICTORY OVER RESSENTIMENT. TO LIBERATE THE SOUL FROM THIS IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD RECOVERY. ‚ÄÚNOT BY ENMITY IS ENMITY ENDED; BY FRIENDLINESS ENMITY IS ENDED‚ÄÙ: THESE WORDS STAND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE BUDDHA.2 IT IS NOT MORALITY THAT SPEAKS THUS; THUS SPEAKS PHYSIOLOGY‚ÄÎ.

BORN OF WEAKNESS, RESSENTIMENT IS MOST HARMFUL FOR THE WEAK THEMSELVES. CONVERSELY, GIVEN A RICH NATURE, IT IS A SUPERFLUOUS FEELING; MASTERING THIS FEELING IS VIRTUALLY WHAT PROVES RICHES. WHOEVER KNOWS HOW SERIOUSLY MY PHILOSOPHY HAS PURSUED THE FIGHT AGAINST VENGEFULNESS AND RANCOR, EVEN INTO THE DOCTRINE OF ‚ÄÚFREE WILL‚ÄÙ3 S‚ÄÎTHE FIGHT AGAINST CHRISTIANITY IS MERELY A SPECIAL CASE OF THIS‚ÄÎWILL UNDERSTAND WHY I AM MAKING SUCH A POINT OF MY OWN BEHAVIOR, MY INSTINCTIVE SURENESS IN PRACTICE. DURING PERIODS OF DECADENCE I FORBADE MYSELF SUCH FEELINGS AS HARMFUL; AS SOON AS MY VITALITY WAS RICH AND PROUD ENOUGH AGAIN, I FORBADE MYSELF SUCH FEELINGS AS BENEATH ME. I DISPLAYED HE ‚ÄÚRUSSIAN FATALISM‚ÄÙ I MENTIONED BY TENACIOUSLY CLINGING FOR YEARS TO ALL BUT INTOLERABLE SITUATIONS, PLACES, APARTMENTS, AND SOCIETY, MERELY BECAUSE THEY HAPPENED TO BE GIVEN BY ACCIDENT: IT WAS BETTER THAN CHANGING THEM, THAN FEELING THAT THEY COULD BE CHANGED‚ÄÎTHAN REBELLING AGAINST THEM.

ANY ATTEMPT TO DISTURB ME IN THIS FATALISM, TO AWAKEN ME BY FORCE, USED TO ANNOY ME MORTALLY‚ÄÎAND IT ACTUALLY WAS MORTALLY DANGEROUS EVERY TIME.

ACCEPTING ONESELF AS IF FATED, NOT WISHING ONESELF ‚ÄÚDIFFERENT‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT IS IN SUCH CASES GREAT REASON ITSELF.

WAR1 IS ANOTHER MATTER. I AM WARLIKE BY NATURE. ATTACKING IS ONE OF MY INSTINCTS. BEING ABLE TO BE AN ENEMY, BEING AN ENEMY‚ÄÎPERHAPS THAT PRESUPPOSES A STRONG NATURE; IN ANY CASE, IT BELONGS TO EVERY STRONG NATURE. IT NEEDS OBJECTS OF RESISTANCE; HENCE IT LOOKS FOR WHAT RESISTS: THE AGGRESSIVE PATHOS BELONGS JUST AS NECESSARILY TO STRENGTH AS VENGEFULNESS AND RANCOR BELONG TO WEAKNESS. WOMAN, FOR EXAMPLE, IS VENGEFUL: THAT IS DUE TO HER WEAKNESS, AS MUCH AS IS HER SUSCEPTIBILITY TO THE DISTRESS OF OTHERS.

THE STRENGTH OF THOSE WHO ATTACK CAN BE MEASURED IN A WAY BY THE OPPOSITION THEY REQUIRE: EVERY GROWTH IS INDICATED BY THE SEARCH FOR A MIGHTY OPPONENT‚ÄÎOR PROBLEM; FOR A WARLIKE PHILOSOPHER CHALLENGES PROBLEMS, TOO, TO SINGLE COMBAT. THE TASK IS NOT SIMPLY TO MASTER WHAT HAPPENS TO RESIST, BUT WHAT REQUIRES US TO STAKE ALL OUR STRENGTH, SUPPLENESS, AND FIGHTING SKILL‚ÄÎOPPONENTS THAT ARE OUR EQUALS.

EQUALITY BEFORE THE ENEMY: THE FIRST PRESUPPOSITION OF AN HONEST DUEL. WHERE ONE FEELS CONTEMPT, ONE CANNOT WAGE WAR; WHERE ONE COMMANDS, WHERE ONE SEES SOMETHING BENEATH ONESELF, ONE HAS NO BUSINESS WAGING WAR.

MY PRACTICE OF WAR CAN BE SUMMED UP IN FOUR PROPOSITIONS. FIRST: I ONLY ATTACK CAUSES THAT ARE VICTORIOUS; I MAY EVEN WAIT UNTIL THEY BECOME VICTORIOUS.2

SECOND: I ONLY ATTACK CAUSES AGAINST WHICH I WOULD NOT FIND ALLIES, SO THAT I STAND ALONE‚ÄÎSO THAT I COMPROMISE MYSELF ALONE.‚ÄÎI HAVE NEVER TAKEN A STEP PUBLICLY THAT DID NOT COMPROMISE ME: THAT IS MY CRITERION OF DOING RIGHT.

THIRD: I NEVER ATTACK PERSONS; I MERELY AVAIL MYSELF OF THE PERSON AS OF A STRONG MAGNIFYING GLASS THAT ALLOWS ONE TO MAKE VISIBLE A GENERAL BUT CREEPING AND ELUSIVE CALAMITY. THUS I ATTACKED DAVID STRAUSS‚ÄÎMORE PRECISELY, THE SUCCESS OF A SENILE BOOK WITH THE ‚ÄÚCULTURED‚ÄÙ PEOPLE IN GERMANY: I CAUGHT THIS CULTURE IN THE ACT.

THUS I ATTACKED WAGNER‚ÄÎMORE PRECISELY, THE FALSENESS, THE HALF-COUTH INSTINCTS OF OUR ‚ÄÚCULTURE‚ÄÙ WHICH MISTAKES THE SUBTLE FOR THE RICH, AND THE LATE FOR THE GREAT.

FOURTH: I ONLY ATTACK THINGS WHEN EVERY PERSONAL QUARREL IS EXCLUDED, WHEN ANY BACKGROUND OF BAD EXPERIENCES IS LACKING. ON THE CONTRARY, ATTACK IS IN MY CASE A PROOF OF GOOD WILL, SOMETIMES EVEN OF GRATITUDE. I HONOR, I DISTINGUISH BY ASSOCIATING MY NAME WITH THAT OF A CAUSE OR A PERSON: PRO OR CON‚ÄÎTHAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME AT THIS POINT. WHEN I WAGE WAR AGAINST CHRISTIANITY I AM ENTITLED TO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED MISFORTUNES AND FRUSTRATIONS FROM THAT QUARTER‚ÄÎTHE MOST SERIOUS CHRISTIANS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WELL DISPOSED TOWARD ME. I MYSELF, AN OPPONENT OF CHRISTIANITY DE RIGUEUR?3 AM FAR FROM BLAMING INDIVIDUALS FOR THE CALAMITY OF MILLENNIA.

MAY I STILL VENTURE TO SKETCH ONE FINAL TRAIT OF MY NATURE THAT CAUSES ME NO LITTLE DIFFICULTIES IN MY CONTACTS WITH OTHER MEN? MY INSTINCT FOR CLEANLINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY A PERFECTLY UNCANNY SENSITIVITY SO THAT THE PROXIMITY OR‚ÄÎWHAT AM I SAYING?‚ÄÎTHE INMOST PARTS, THE ‚ÄÚENTRAILS‚ÄÙ OF EVERY SOUL ARE PHYSIOLOGICALLY PERCEIVED BY ME‚ÄÎSMELTED.

THIS SENSITIVITY FURNISHES ME WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL ANTENNAE WITH WHICH I FEEL AND GET A HOLD OF EVERY SECRET: THE ABUNDANT HIDDEN DIRT AT THE BOTTOM OF MANY A CHARACTER‚ÄÎPERHAPS THE RESULT OF BAD BLOOD, BUT GLOSSED OVER BY EDUCATION‚ÄÎENTERS MY CONSCIOUSNESS ALMOST AT THE FIRST CONTACT. IF MY OBSERVATION HAS NOT DECEIVED ME, SUCH CHARACTERS WHO OFFEND MY SENSE OF CLEANLINESS ALSO SENSE FROM THEIR SIDE THE RESERVE OF MY DISGUST‚ÄÎAND THIS DOES NOT MAKE THEM SMELL ANY BETTER.

AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY WONT‚ÄÎEXTREME CLEANLINESS IN RELATION TO ME IS THE PRESUPPOSITION OF MY EXISTENCE; I PERISH UNDER UNCLEAN CONDITIONS‚ÄÎI CONSTANTLY SWIM AND BATHE AND SPLASH, AS IT WERE, IN WATER‚ÄÎIN SOME PERFECTLY TRANSPARENT AND RESPLENDENT ELEMENT. HENCE ASSOCIATION WITH PEOPLE IMPOSES NO MEAN TEST ON MY PATIENCE: MY HUMANITY DOES NOT CONSIST IN FEELING WITH MEN HOW THEY ARE, BUT IN ENDURING THAT I FEEL WITH THEM.1

MY HUMANITY IS A CONSTANT SELF-OVERCOMING.

BUT I NEED SOLITUDE‚ÄÎWHICH IS TO SAY, RECOVERY, RETURN TO MYSELF, THE BREATH OF A FREE, LIGHT, PLAYFUL AIR.

MY WHOLE ZARATHUSTRA IS A DITHYRAMB ON SOLITUDE OR, IF I HAVE BEEN UNDERSTOOD, ON CLEANLINESS.2‚ÄÎFORTUNATELY NOT ON PURE FOOLISHNESS?‚ÄÎTHOSE WHO HAVE EYES FOR COLORS WILL COMPARE IT TO A DIAMOND.‚ÄÎNAUSEA OVER MAN, OVER THE ‚ÄÚRABBLE,‚ÄÙ WAS ALWAYS MY GREATEST DANGER.‚ÄÎDO YOU WANT TO HEAR THE WORDS IN WHICH ZARATHUSTRA SPEAKS OF THE REDEMPTION FROM NAUSEA?

WHAT WAS IT THAT HAPPENED TO ME? HOW DID I REDEEM MYSELF FROM NAUSEA? WHO REJUVENATED MY SIGHT? HOW DID I FLY TO THE HEIGHT WHERE NO MORE RABBLE SITS BY THE WELL? WAS IT MY NAUSEA ITSELF THAT CREATED WINGS FOR ME AND WATER-DIVINING POWERS? VERILY, I HAD TO FLY TO THE HIGHEST SPHERES THAT I MIGHT FIND THE FOUNT OF PLEASURE AGAIN.

OH, I FOUND IT, MY BROTHERS! HERE, IN THE HIGHEST SPHERES THE FOUNT OF PLEASURE WELLS UP FOR ME! AND HERE IS A LIFE OF WHICH THE RABBLE DOES NOT DRINK.

YOU FLOW FOR ME ALMOST TOO VIOLENTLY, FOUNTAIN OF PLEASURE. AND OFTEN YOU EMPTY THE CUP AGAIN BY WANTING TO FILL IT. AND I MUST STILL LEARN TO APPROACH YOU MORE MODESTLY: ALL TOO VIOLENTLY MY HEART STILL FLOWS TOWARD YOU‚ÄÎMY HEART, UPON WHICH MY SUMMER BURNS, SHORT, HOT, MELANCHOLY, OVERBLISSFUL: HOW MY SUMMER HEART CRAVES YOUR COOLNESS!

GONE IS THE HESITANT GLOOM OF MY SPRING! GONE THE SNOW-FLAKES OF MY MALICE IN JUNE!3 SUMMER HAVE I BECOME ENTIRELY, AND SUMMER NOON! A SUMMER IN THE HIGHEST SPHERES WITH COLD WELLS AND BLISSFUL SILENCE: OH, COME, MY FRIENDS, THAT THE SILENCE MAY BECOME STILL MORE BLISSFUL!

FOR THIS IS OUR HEIGHT AND OUR HOME: WE LIVE HERE TOO HIGH AND STEEP FOR ALL THE UNCLEAN AND THEIR THIRST. CAST YOUR PURE EYES INTO THE WELL OF MY PLEASURE, FRIENDS! HOW SHOULD THAT MAKE IT MUDDY? IT SHALL LAUGH BACK AT YOU IN ITS OWN PURITY.

ON THE TREE, FUTURE, WE BUILD OUR NEST; AND IN OUR SOLITUDE EAGLES SHALL BRING US NOURISHMENT IN THEIR BEAKS. VERILY, NO NOURISHMENT THAT THE UNCLEAN MIGHT SHARE: THEY WOULD THINK THEY WERE DEVOURING FIRE, AND THEY WOULD BURN THEIR MOUTHS. VERILY, WE KEEP NO HOMES HERE FOR THE UNCLEAN: OUR PLEASURE WOULD BE AN ICE CAVE TO THEIR BODIES AND THEIR SPIRITS.

AND WE WANT TO LIVE OVER THEM LIKE STRONG WINDS, NEIGHBORS OF THE EAGLES, NEIGHBORS OF THE SNOW, NEIGHBORS OF THE SUN: THUS LIVE STRONG WINDS. AND LIKE A WIND I YET WANT TO BLOW AMONG THEM ONE DAY, AND WITH MY SPIRIT TAKE AWAY THE BREATH OF THEIR SPIRIT: THUS MY FUTURE WILLS IT.

VERILY, A STRONG WIND IS ZARATHUSTRA FOR ALL WHO ARE LOW; AND THIS COUNSEL I GIVE TO ALL HIS ENEMIES AND ALL WHO SPIT AND SPEW: BEWARE OF SPITTING AGAINST THE WIND! ‚Ä¶

WHY I AM SO CLEVER





1


WHY DO I KNOW A FEW THINGS MORE? WHY AM I ALTOGETHER SO CLEVER? I HAVE NEVER REFLECTED ON QUESTIONS THAT ARE NONE‚ÄÎI HAVE NOT WASTED MYSELF.

REALLY RELIGIOUS DIFFICULTIES, FOR EXAMPLE, I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE. IT HAS ESCAPED ME ALTOGETHER IN WHAT WAY I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ‚ÄÚSINFUL.‚ÄÙ LIKEWISE, I LACK ANY RELIABLE CRITERION FOR RECOGNIZING THE BITE OF CONSCIENCE: ACCORDING TO WHAT ONE HEARS ABOUT IT, THE BITE OF CONSCIENCE DOES NOT SEEM RESPECTABLE TO ME.

I DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE AN ACTION IN THE LURCH AFTERWARD;1 I SHOULD PREFER TO EXCLUDE THE BAD RESULT, THE CONSEQUENCES, FROM THE QUESTION OF VALUE AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE. FACED WITH A BAD RESULT, ONE LOSES ALL TOO EASILY THE RIGHT PERSPECTIVE FOR WHAT ONE HAS DONE: THE BITE OF CONSCIENCE SEEMS TO ME A KIND OF ‚ÄÚEVIL EYE.‚ÄÙ TO HOLD IN HONOR IN ONE‚ÄÔS HEART EVEN MORE WHAT HAS FAILED, BECAUSE IT FAILED‚ÄÎTHAT WOULD GO BETTER WITH MY MORALITY.

‚ÄÚGOD,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚIMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚREDEMPTION,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚBEYOND‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWITHOUT EXCEPTION, CONCEPTS TO WHICH I NEVER DEVOTED ANY ATTENTION, OR TIME; NOT EVEN AS A CHILD. PERHAPS I HAVE NEVER BEEN CHILDLIKE ENOUGH FOR THEM?

I DO NOT BY ANY MEANS KNOW ATHEISM AS A RESULT; EVEN LESS AS AN EVENT: IT IS A MATTER OF COURSE WITH ME, FROM INSTINCT. I AM TOO INQUISITIVE, TOO QUESTIONABLE, TOO EXUBERANT TO STAND FOR ANY GROSS ANSWER.2 GOD IS A GROSS ANSWER, AN INDELICACY AGAINST US THINKERS‚ÄÎAT BOTTOM MERELY A GROSS PROHIBITION FOR US: YOU SHALL NOT THINK!

I AM MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN A QUESTION ON WHICH THE ‚ÄÚSALVATION OF HUMANITY‚ÄÙ DEPENDS FAR MORE THAN ON ANY THEOLOGIANS‚ÄÔ CURIO: THE QUESTION OF NUTRITION. FOR ORDINARY USE, ONE MAY FORMULATE IT THUS: ‚ÄÚHOW DO YOU, AMONG ALL PEOPLE, HAVE TO EAT TO ATTAIN YOUR MAXIMUM OF STRENGTH, OF VIRTU IN THE RENAISSANCE STYLE, OF MORALINE-FREE3 VIRTUE?‚ÄÙ

MY EXPERIENCES IN THIS MATTER ARE AS BAD AS POSSIBLE; I AM AMAZED HOW LATE I HEARD THIS QUESTION, HOW LATE I LEARNED ‚ÄÚREASON‚ÄÙ FROM THESE EXPERIENCES. ONLY THE COMPLETE WORTHLESSNESS OF OUR GERMAN EDUCATION‚ÄÎITS ‚ÄÚIDEALISM‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎEXPLAINS TO ME TO SOME EXTENT WHY AT PRECISELY THIS POINT I WAS BACKWARD TO THE POINT OF HOLINESS. THIS ‚ÄÚEDUCATION‚ÄÙ WHICH TEACHES ONE FROM THE START TO IGNORE REALITIES AND TO PURSUE SO-CALLED ‚ÄÚIDEAL‚ÄÙ GOALS‚ÄÎA ‚ÄÚCLASSICAL EDUCATION,‚ÄÙ FOR EXAMPLE‚ÄÎAS IF IT WERE NOT HOPELESS FROM THE START TO UNITE ‚ÄÚCLASSICAL‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚGERMAN‚ÄÙ INTO A SINGLE CONCEPT! MORE, IT IS AMUSING: ONLY IMAGINE A ‚ÄÚCLASSICALLY EDUCATED‚ÄÙ MAN WITH A LEIPZIG DIALECT!4

INDEED, TILL I REACHED A VERY MATURE AGE I ALWAYS ATE BADLY: MORALLY SPEAKING, ‚ÄÚIMPERSONALLY,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚSELFLESSLY,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚALTRUISTICALLY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎFOR THE BENEFIT OF COOKS AND OTHER FELLOW CHRISTIANS. BY MEANS OF LEIPZIG CUISINE, FOR EXAMPLE, I VERY EARNESTLY DENIED MY ‚ÄÚWILL TO LIFE‚ÄÙ AT THE TIME WHEN I FIRST READ SCHOPENHAUER (1865). TO UPSET ONE‚ÄÔS STOMACH FOR THE SAKE OF INADEQUATE NUTRITION‚ÄÎTHIS PROBLEM SEEMED TO ME TO BE SOLVED INCREDIBLY WELL BY THE AFOREMENTIONED CUISINE. (IT IS SAID THAT 1866 BROUGHT ABOUT A CHANGE IN THIS RESPECT.)5 BUT GERMAN CUISINE QUITE GENERALLY‚ÄÎWHAT DOESN‚ÄÔT IT HAVE ON ITS CONSCIENCE! SOUP BEFORE THE MEAL (IN VENETIAN COOKBOOKS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY THIS IS STILL CALLED ALIA TEDESCA);6 OVERCOOKED MEATS, VEGETABLES COOKED WITH FAT AND FLOUR; THE DEGENERATION OF PASTRIES AND PUDDINGS INTO PAPERWEIGHTS! ADD TO THIS THE VIRTUALLY BESTIAL PRANDIAL DRINKING HABITS OF THE ANCIENT, AND BY NO MEANS ONLY THE ANCIENT GERMANS, AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE ORIGIN OF THE GERMAN SPIRIT‚ÄÎFROM DISTRESSED INTESTINES.

THE GERMAN SPIRIT IS AN INDIGESTION: IT DOES NOT FINISH WITH ANYTHING.

BUT ENGLISH DIET, TOO‚ÄÎWHICH IS, COMPARED TO THE GERMAN AND EVEN TO THE FRENCH, A KIND OF ‚ÄÚRETURN TO NATURE,‚ÄÙ MEANING TO CANNIBALISM‚ÄÎIS PROFOUNDLY AT ODDS WITH MY INSTINCTS: IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT GIVES THE SPIRIT HEAVY FEET‚ÄÎTHE FEET OF ENGLISH WOMEN.

THE BEST CUISINE IS THAT OF PIEDMONT.7

ALCOHOL IS BAD FOR ME: A SINGLE GLASS OF WINE OR BEER IN ONE DAY IS QUITE SUFFICIENT TO TURN MY LIFE INTO A VALE OF MISERY‚ÄÎTHE PEOPLE OF MUNICH ARE MY ANTIPODES. ASSUMING THAT I DID NOT COMPREHEND THIS UNTIL RATHER LATE, I REALLY EXPERIENCED IT FROM CHILDHOOD. AS A BOY I BELIEVED THAT DRINKING WINE WAS, LIKE SMOKING, TO BEGIN WITH MERELY A VANITY OF YOUNG MEN, AND LATER ON A BAD HABIT. PERHAPS THIS HARSH JUDGMENT SHOULD BE BLAMED IN PART ON THE WINE OF NAUMBURG.8 TO BELIEVE THAT WINE EXHILARATES I SHOULD HAVE TO BE A CHRISTIAN‚ÄÎBELIEVING WHAT IS FOR ME AN ABSURDITY. STRANGELY ENOUGH, IN SPITE OF THIS EXTREME VULNERABILITY TO SMALL, STRONGLY DILUTED DOSES OF ALCOHOL, I ALMOST BECOME A SAILOR WHEN IT IS A MATTER OF STRONG DOSES. EVEN AS A BOY, MY FORTITUDE APPEARED AT THAT POINT. WRITING A LONG LATIN ESSAY IN A SINGLE NIGHT, AND COPYING IT OVER, TOO, WITH THE AMBITION IN MY PEN TO EMULATE MY MODEL, SALLUST, IN SEVERITY AND COMPACTNESS, AND TO POUR SOME GROG OF THE HEAVIEST CALIBER OVER MY LATIN‚ÄÎEVEN WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AT THE VENERABLE SCHULPFORTA,9 THAT DID NOT IN ANY WAY DISAGREE WITH MY PHYSIOLOGY, NOR PERHAPS WITH THAT OF SALLUST‚ÄÎHOWEVER IT DISAGREED WITH THE VENERABLE SCHULPFORTA.

LATER, AROUND THE MIDDLE OF LIFE, TO BE SURE, I DECIDED MORE AND MORE STRICTLY AGAINST ALL ‚ÄÚSPIRITS‚ÄÙ: I, AN OPPONENT OF VEGETARIANISM FROM EXPERIENCE, JUST LIKE RICHARD WAGNER, WHO CONVERTED ME, CANNOT ADVISE ALL MORE SPIRITUAL NATURES EARNESTLY ENOUGH TO ABSTAIN ENTIRELY FROM ALCOHOL. WATER IS SUFFICIENT.

I PREFER TOWNS IN WHICH OPPORTUNITIES ABOUND FOR DIPPING FROM RUNNING WELLS (NIZZA, TURIN, SILS); A SMALL GLASS ACCOMPANIES ME LIKE A DOG.10 IN VINO VERITAS:11 IT SEEMS THAT HERE, TOO, I AM AT ODDS WITH ALL THE WORLD ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF ‚ÄÚTRUTH‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎIN MY CASE, THE SPIRIT MOVES OVER WATER.12

A FEW MORE HINTS FROM MY MORALITY. A HEARTY MEAL IS EASIER TO DIGEST THAN ONE THAT IS TOO SMALL. THAT THE STOMACH AS A WHOLE BECOMES ACTIVE IS THE FIRST PRESUPPOSITION OF A GOOD DIGESTION. ONE HAS TO KNOW THE SIZE OF ONE‚ÄÔS STOMACH. FOR THE SAME REASON ONE SHOULD BE WARNED AGAINST THOSE LONG-DRAWN-OUT MEALS WHICH I CALL INTERRUPTED SACRIFICIAL FEASTS‚ÄÎTHOSE AT A TABLE D‚ÄÔH√¥TE.

NO MEALS BETWEEN MEALS, NO COFFEE: COFFEE SPREADS DARKNESS. TEA IS WHOLESOME ONLY IN THE MORNING. A LITTLE, BUT STRONG: TEA IS VERY UNWHOLESOME AND SICKLIES ONE O‚ÄÔER THE WHOLE DAY IF IT IS TOO WEAK BY A SINGLE DEGREE. EVERYBODY HAS HIS OWN MEASURE, OFTEN BETWEEN THE NARROWEST AND MOST DELICATE LIMITS. IN A CLIMATE THAT IS VERY AGA√ßANT,13 TEA IS NOT ADVISABLE FOR A BEGINNING: ONE SHOULD BEGIN AN HOUR EARLIER WITH A CUP OF THICK, OIL-LESS COCOA.

SIT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE; GIVE NO CREDENCE TO ANY THOUGHT THAT WAS NOT BORN OUTDOORS WHILE ONE MOVED ABOUT FREELY‚ÄÎIN WHICH THE MUSCLES ARE NOT CELEBRATING A FEAST, TOO. ALL PREJUDICES14 COME FROM THE INTESTINES.

THE SEDENTARY LIFE‚ÄÎAS I HAVE SAID ONCE BEFORE15‚ÄÎIS THE REAL SIN AGAINST THE HOLY SPIRIT.

THE QUESTION OF PLACE AND CLIMATE IS MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO THE QUESTION OF NUTRITION. NOBODY IS FREE TO LIVE EVERYWHERE; AND WHOEVER HAS TO SOLVE GREAT PROBLEMS THAT CHALLENGE ALL HIS STRENGTH ACTUALLY HAS A VERY RESTRICTED CHOICE IN THIS MATTER. THE INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE ON OUR METABOLISM, ITS RETARDATION, ITS ACCELERATION, GOES SO FAR THAT A MISTAKEN CHOICE OF PLACE AND CLIMATE CAN NOT ONLY ESTRANGE A MAN FROM HIS TASK BUT CAN ACTUALLY KEEP IT FROM HIM: HE NEVER GETS TO SEE IT. HIS ANIMAL VIGOR HAS NEVER BECOME GREAT ENOUGH FOR HIM TO ATTAIN THAT FREEDOM WHICH OVERFLOWS INTO THE MOST SPIRITUAL REGIONS AND ALLOWS ONE TO RECOGNIZE: THIS ONLY I CAN DO.

THE SLIGHTEST SLUGGISHNESS OF THE INTESTINES IS ENTIRELY SUFFICIENT, ONCE IT HAS BECOME A BAD HABIT, TO TURN A GENIUS INTO SOMETHING MEDIOCRE, SOMETHING ‚ÄÚGERMAN.‚ÄÙ THE GERMAN CLIMATE ALONE IS ENOUGH TO DISCOURAGE STRONG, EVEN INHERENTLY HEROIC, INTESTINES. THE TEMPO OF THE METABOLISM IS STRICTLY PROPORTIONATE TO THE MOBILITY OR LAMENESS OF THE SPIRIT‚ÄÔS FEET; THE ‚ÄÚSPIRIT‚ÄÙ ITSELF IS AFTER ALL MERELY AN ASPECT OF THIS METABOLISM. LIST THE PLACES WHERE MEN WITH ESPRIT1 ARE LIVING OR HAVE LIVED, WHERE WIT, SUBTLETY, AND MALICE BELONGED TO HAPPINESS, WHERE GENIUS FOUND ITS HOME ALMOST OF NECESSITY: ALL OF THEM HAVE EXCELLENT DRY AIR. PARIS, PROVENCE, FLORENCE, JERUSALEM, ATHENS‚ÄÎTHESE NAMES PROVE SOMETHING: GENIUS DEPENDS ON DRY AIR, ON CLEAR SKIES‚ÄÎTHAT IS, ON A RAPID METABOLISM, ON THE POSSIBILITY OF DRAWING AGAIN AND AGAIN ON GREAT, EVEN TREMENDOUS QUANTITIES OF STRENGTH. I KNOW OF A CASE IN WHICH A SPIRIT OF GENEROUS PREDISPOSITION, DESTINED FOR GREATNESS, BECAME, MERELY BECAUSE HE LACKED ANY DELICATE INSTINCT FOR CLIMATE, NARROW, WITHDRAWN, A PEEVISH SPECIALIST. AND I MYSELF MIGHT ULTIMATELY HAVE BECOME JUST SUCH A CASE, IF MY SICKNESS HAD NOT FORCED ME TO SEE REASON, TO REFLECT ON REASON IN REALITY. NOW THAT THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE AND WEATHER ARE FAMILIAR TO ME FROM LONG EXPERIENCE AND I TAKE READINGS FROM MYSELF AS FROM A VERY SUBTLE AND RELIABLE INSTRUMENT‚ÄÎAND EVEN DURING A SHORT JOURNEY, SAY, FROM TURIN TO MILAN, MY SYSTEM REGISTERS THE CHANGE IN THE HUMIDITY‚ÄÎI REFLECT WITH HORROR ON THE DISMAL FACT THAT MY LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS, THE YEARS WHEN MY LIFE WAS IN PERIL, WAS SPENT ENTIRELY IN THE WRONG PLACES THAT WERE NOTHING SHORT OF FORBIDDEN TO ME. NAUMBURG, SCHULPFORTA, THE PROVINCE OF THURINGIA QUITE GENERALLY, LEIPZIG, BASEL, VENICE‚ÄÎSO MANY DISASTROUS PLACES FOR MY PHYSIOLOGY.

ALTOGETHER, I HAVE NO WELCOME MEMORIES WHATEVER FROM MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH; BUT IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO DRAG IN SO-CALLED ‚ÄÚMORAL‚ÄÙ REASONS, SUCH AS THE UNDENIABLE LACK OF ADEQUATE COMPANY: FOR THIS LACK PERSISTS TODAY AS IT HAS ALWAYS PERSISTED, WITHOUT PREVENTING ME FROM BEING CHEERFUL AND BRAVE. RATHER IT WAS THE IGNORANCE IN PHYSIOLOGICIS‚ÄÎTHAT DAMNED ‚ÄÚIDEALISM‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT WAS THE REAL CALAMITY IN MY LIFE, TOTALLY SUPERFLUOUS AND STUPID, SOMETHING OF WHICH NOTHING GOOD EVER GREW, FOR WHICH THERE IS NO COMPENSATION, NO COUNTERBALANCE. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS ‚ÄÚIDEALISM‚ÄÙ PROVIDE MY EXPLANATION OF ALL BLUNDERS, ALL GREAT INSTINCTUAL ABERRATIONS AND ‚ÄÚMODESTIES‚ÄÙ THAT LED ME AWAY FROM THE TASK OF MY LIFE; FOR EXAMPLE, THAT I BECAME A PHILOLOGIST‚ÄÎWHY NOT AT LEAST A PHYSICIAN OR SOMETHING ELSE THAT OPENS ONE‚ÄÔS EYES?

DURING MY BASEL PERIOD2 MY WHOLE SPIRITUAL DIET, INCLUDING THE WAY I DIVIDED UP MY DAY, WAS A COMPLETELY SENSELESS ABUSE OF EXTRAORDINARY RESOURCES, WITHOUT ANY NEW SUPPLY TO COVER THIS CONSUMPTION IN ANY WAY, WITHOUT EVEN ANY THOUGHT ABOUT CONSUMPTION AND REPLENISHMENT. ANY REFINED SELF-CONCERN, ANY PROTECTION BY SOME COMMANDING INSTINCT WAS LACKING; I SIMPLY POSITED MYSELF AS EQUAL TO ANY NOBODY; IT WAS A ‚ÄÚSELFLESSNESS,‚ÄÙ AN OBLIVION OF ALL DISTANCE BETWEEN MYSELF AND OTHERS THAT I SHALL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF. WHEN I WAS CLOSE TO THE END, BECAUSE I WAS CLOSE TO THE END, I BEGAN TO REFLECT ON THIS FUNDAMENTAL UNREASON OF MY LIFE‚ÄÎTHIS ‚ÄÚIDEALISM.‚ÄÙ ONLY MY SICKNESS BROUGHT ME TO REASON.

THE CHOICE OF NUTRITION; THE CHOICE OF CLIMATE AND PLACE: THE THIRD POINT AT WHICH ONE MUST NOT COMMIT A BLUNDER AT ANY PRICE IS THE CHOICE OF ONE‚ÄÔS OWN KIND OF RECREATION. HERE, TOO, DEPENDING ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH A SPIRIT IS SUI GENERIS,1 THE LIMITS OF WHAT IS PERMITTED TO HIM, THAT IS, PROFITABLE FOR HIM, ARE NARROW, QUITE NARROW. IN MY CASE, EVERY KIND OF READING BELONGS AMONG MY RECREATIONS‚ÄÎHENCE AMONG THE THINGS THAT LIBERATE ME FROM MYSELF, THAT ALLOW ME TO WALK ABOUT IN STRANGE SCIENCES AND SOULS‚ÄÎTHAT I NO LONGER TAKE SERIOUSLY. READING IS PRECISELY MY RECREATION FROM MY OWN SERIOUSNESS. DURING PERIODS WHEN I AM HARD AT WORK YOU WILL NOT FIND ME SURROUNDED BY BOOKS: I‚ÄÔD BEWARE OF LETTING ANYONE NEAR ME TALK, MUCH LESS THINK. AND THAT IS WHAT READING WOULD MEAN.

HAS IT BEEN NOTED THAT IN THAT PROFOUND TENSION TO WHICH PREGNANCY CONDEMNS THE SPIRIT, AND AT BOTTOM THE WHOLE ORGANISM, CHANCE AND ANY KIND OF STIMULUS FROM THE OUTSIDE HAVE TOO VEHEMENT AN EFFECT AND STRIKE2 TOO DEEP? ONE MUST AVOID CHANCE AND OUTSIDE STIMULI AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE; A KIND OF WALLING ONESELF IN BELONGS AMONG THE FOREMOST INSTINCTIVE PRECAUTIONS OF SPIRITUAL PREGNANCY. SHOULD I PERMIT AN ALIEN THOUGHT TO SCALE THE WALL SECRETLY?‚ÄÎ AND THAT IS WHAT READING WOULD MEAN.

THE PERIODS OF WORK AND FERTILITY ARE FOLLOWED BY PERIODS OF RECREATION: COME TO ME, PLEASANT, BRILLIANT, CLEVER BOOKS!

WILL IT BE GERMAN BOOKS?

I MUST COUNT BACK HALF A YEAR BEFORE CATCHING MYSELF WITH A BOOK IN MY HAND. WHAT WAS IT?‚ÄÎA SUPERB STUDY BY VICTOR BROCHARD, LES SCEPTIQUES GRECS,3 IN WHICH MY LAERTIANA4 ARE ALSO PUT TO GOOD USE. THE SKEPTICS, THE ONLY HONORABLE TYPE AMONG THE EQUIVOCAL, QUINQUIVOCAL TRIBE OF PHILOSOPHERS!

OTHERWISE I ALMOST ALWAYS SEEK REFUGE WITH THE SAME BOOKS‚ÄÎACTUALLY, A SMALL NUMBER‚ÄÎBOOKS PROVED TO ME. PERHAPS IT IS NOT MY WAY TO READ MUCH, OR DIVERSE THINGS: A READING ROOM MAKES ME SICK. NOR IS IT MY WAY TO LOVE MUCH, OR DIVERSE THINGS. CAUTION, EVEN HOSTILITY AGAINST NEW BOOKS COMES CLOSER TO MY INSTINCTS THAN ‚ÄÚTOLERANCE,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚLARGEUR DU COEUR,‚ÄÙ5 AND OTHER ‚ÄÚNEIGHBOR LOVE.‚ÄÙ6

IT IS A SMALL NUMBER OF OLD FRENCHMEN TO WHOM I RETURN AGAIN AND AGAIN: I BELIEVE ONLY IN FRENCH CULTURE7 AND CONSIDER EVERYTHING ELSE IN EUROPE TODAY THAT CALLS ITSELF ‚ÄÚCULTURE‚ÄÙ A MISUNDERSTANDING‚ÄÎNOT TO SPEAK OF GERMAN CULTURE.

THE FEW CASES OF HIGH CULTURE THAT I HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN GERMANY HAVE ALL BEEN OF FRENCH ORIGIN, ESPECIALLY FRAU COSIMA WAGNER, BY FAR THE FIRST VOICE IN MATTERS OF TASTE THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD.

THE FACT THAT I DO NOT READ BUT LOVE PASCAL, AS THE MOST INSTRUCTIVE VICTIM OF CHRISTIANITY, MURDERED SLOWLY, FIRST PHYSICALLY, THEN PSYCHOLOGICALLY‚ÄÎTHE WHOLE LOGIC OF THIS MOST GRUESOME FORM OF INHUMAN CRUELTY; THAT I HAVE IN MY SPIRIT‚ÄÎWHO KNOWS? PERHAPS ALSO IN MY BODY‚ÄÎSOMETHING OF MONTAIGNE‚ÄÔS SPORTIVENESS; THAT MY ARTIST‚ÄÔS TASTE VINDICATES THE NAMES OF MOLI√®RE, CORNEILLE, AND RACINE, NOT WITHOUT FURY, AGAINST A WILD GENIUS LIKE SHAKESPEARE‚ÄÎALL THAT DOES NOT PRECLUDE IN THE END THAT I FIND EVEN THE MOST RECENT FRENCHMEN CHARMING COMPANY. I DO NOT SEE FROM WHAT CENTURY OF THE PAST ONE COULD DREDGE UP SUCH INQUISITIVE AND AT THE SAME TIME SUCH DELICATE PSYCHOLOGISTS AS IN CONTEMPORARY PARIS: TENTATIVELY‚ÄÎFOR THEIR NUMBER IS FAR FROM SMALL‚ÄÎI NAME MESSIEURS PAUL BOURGET, PIERRE LOTI, GYP, MEILHAC, ANATOLE FRANCE, JULES LEMA√ÆTRE, OR,TO SINGLE OUT ONE OF THE STRONG RACE, A GENUINE LATIN TOWARD WHOM I AM ESPECIALLY WELL DISPOSED, GUY DE MAUPASSANT.8 BETWEEN OURSELVES, I PREFER THIS GENERATION EVEN TO THEIR GREAT TEACHERS WHO, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, HAVE BEEN CORRUPTED BY GERMAN PHILOSOPHY (M. TAINE, FOR EXAMPLE, BY HEGEL, TO WHOM HE OWES HIS MISUNDERSTANDING OF GREAT MEN AND AGES). AS FAR AS GERMANY EXTENDS, SHE CORRUPTS CULTURE. ONLY THE WAR9‚ÄÚREDEEMED‚ÄÙ THE SPIRIT IN FRANCE.

STENDHAL, ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ACCIDENTS OF MY LIFE‚ÄÎFOR WHATEVER MARKS AN EPOCH IN IT CAME MY WAY BY ACCIDENT, NEVER THROUGH SOMEONE‚ÄÔS RECOMMENDATION‚ÄÎIS TRULY INVALUABLE WITH HIS ANTICIPATORY PSYCHOLOGIST‚ÄÔS EYE, WITH HIS KNACK FOR THE FACTS WHICH IS REMINISCENT OF THE GREATEST OF FACTUAL MEN (EX UNGUE NAPOLEONEM),10 AND FINALLY NOT LEAST AS AN HONEST ATHEIST‚ÄÎA SPECIES THAT IS RARE IN FRANCE AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND‚ÄÎWITH ALL DUE RESPECT FOR PROSPER M√©RIM√©E.11

PERHAPS I AM EVEN ENVIOUS OF STENDHAL? HE TOOK AWAY FROM ME THE BEST ATHEISTICAL JOKE THAT PRECISELY I MIGHT HAVE MADE: ‚ÄÚGOD‚ÄÔS ONLY EXCUSE IS THAT HE DOES NOT EXIST.‚ÄÙ I MYSELF HAVE SAID SOMEWHERE: WHAT HAS BEEN THE GREATEST OBJECTION TO EXISTENCE SO FAR? GOD.12

THE HIGHEST CONCEPT OF THE LYRICAL POET WAS GIVEN TO ME BY HEINRICH HEINE. I SEEK IN VAIN IN ALL THE REALMS OF HISTORY FOR AN EQUALLY SWEET AND PASSIONATE MUSIC. HE POSSESSED THAT DIVINE MALICE WITHOUT WHICH I CANNOT IMAGINE PERFECTION: I ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF MEN, OF RACES, ACCORDING TO THE NECESSITY BY WHICH THEY CANNOT CONCEIVE THE GOD APART FROM THE SATYR.

AND HOW HE HANDLES HIS GERMAN! ONE DAY IT WILL BE SAID THAT HEINE AND I HAVE BEEN BY FAR THE FOREMOST ARTISTS OF THE GERMAN LANGUAGE‚ÄÎAT AN INCALCULABLE DISTANCE FROM EVERYTHING MERE GERMANS HAVE DONE WITH IT.1

I MUST BE PROFOUNDLY RELATED TO BYRON‚ÄÔS MANFRED: ALL THESE ABYSSES I FOUND IN MYSELF; AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN I WAS RIPE FOR THIS WORK. I HAVE NO WORD, ONLY A GLANCE, FOR THOSE WHO DARE TO PRONOUNCE THE WORD ‚ÄÚFAUST‚ÄÙ IN THE PRESENCE OF MANFRED.2 THE GERMANS ARE INCAPABLE OF ANY NOTION OF GREATNESS; PROOF: SCHUMANN. SIMPLY FROM FURY AGAINST THIS SUGARY SAXON, I COMPOSED A COUNTER-OVERTURE FOR MANFRED OF WHICH HANS VON B√ºLOW SAID THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT ON PAPER, AND HE CALLED IT RAPE OF EUTERPE.3

WHEN I SEEK MY ULTIMATE FORMULA FOR SHAKESPEARE, I ALWAYS FIND ONLY THIS: HE CONCEIVED OF THE TYPE OF CAESAR. THAT SORT OF THING CANNOT, BE GUESSED: ONE EITHER IS IT, OR ONE IS NOT. THE GREAT POET DIPS ONLY FROM HIS OWN REALITY‚ÄÎUP TO THE POINT WHERE AFTERWARD HE CANNOT ENDURE HIS WORK ANY LONGER.

WHEN I HAVE LOOKED INTO MY ZARATHUSTRA, I WALK UP AND DOWN IN MY ROOM FOR HALF AN HOUR, UNABLE TO MASTER AN UNBEARABLE FIT OF SOBBING.

I KNOW NO MORE HEART-RENDING READING THAN SHAKESPEARE: WHAT MUST A MAN HAVE SUFFERED TO HAVE SUCH A NEED OF BEING A BUFFOON!4

IS HAMLET UNDERSTOOD? NOT DOUBT, CERTAINTY IS WHAT DRIVES ONE INSANE!5‚ÄÎBUT ONE MUST BE PROFOUND, AN ABYSS, A PHILOSOPHER TO FEEL THAT WAY.‚ÄÎWE ARE ALL AFRAID OF TRUTH.

AND LET ME CONFESS IT: I FEEL INSTINCTIVELY SURE AND CERTAIN THAT LORD BACON WAS THE ORIGINATOR, THE SELF-TORMENTOR6 OF THIS UNCANNIEST KIND OF LITERATURE: WHAT IS THE PITIABLE CHATTER OF AMERICAN FLAT-AND MUDDLE-HEADS TO ME? BUT THE STRENGTH REQUIRED FOR THE VISION OF THE MOST POWERFUL REALITY IS NOT ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE MOST POWERFUL STRENGTH FOR ACTION, FOR MONSTROUS ACTION, FOR CRIME‚ÄÎIT EVEN PRESUPPOSES IT.7

WE ARE VERY FAR FROM KNOWING ENOUGH ABOUT LORD BACON, THE FIRST REALIST IN EVERY GREAT SENSE OF THAT WORD, TO KNOW EVERYTHING HE DID, WANTED, AND EXPERIENCED IN HIMSELF.

AND DAMN IT, MY DEAR CRITICS! SUPPOSE I HAD PUBLISHED MY ZARATHUSTRA UNDER ANOTHER NAME‚ÄÎFOR EXAMPLE, THAT OF RICHARD WAGNER‚ÄÎTHE ACUTENESS OF TWO THOUSAND YEARS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT FOR ANYONE TO GUESS THAT THE AUTHOR OF HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN IS THE VISIONARY OF ZARATHUSTRA.

SPEAKING OF THE RECREATIONS OF MY LIFE, I MUST SAY A WORD TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR WHAT HAS BEEN BY FAR THE MOST PROFOUND AND CORDIAL RECREATION OF MY LIFE. BEYOND A DOUBT, THAT WAS MY INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WITH RICHARD WAGNER. I‚ÄÔD LET GO CHEAP THE WHOLE REST OF MY HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS; I SHOULD NOT WANT TO GIVE AWAY OUT OF MY LIFE AT ANY PRICE THE DAYS OF TRIBSCHEN1‚ÄÎDAYS OF TRUST, OF CHEERFULNESS, OF SUBLIME ACCIDENTS, OF PROFOUND MOMENTS.

I DO NOT KNOW WHAT EXPERIENCES OTHERS HAVE HAD WITH WAGNER: OUR SKY WAS NEVER DARKENED BY A SINGLE CLOUD.

AND WITH THAT I RETURN ONCE MORE TO FRANCE‚ÄÎI HAVE NO REASONS BUT MERELY A CONTEMPTUOUS CORNER OF THE MOUTH FOR WAGNERIANS ET HOC GENUS OMNE2 WHO THINK THEY ARE HONORING WAGNER BY FINDING HIM SIMILAR TO THEMSELVES.

THE WAY I AM, SO ALIEN IN MY DEEPEST INSTINCTS TO EVERYTHING GERMAN THAT THE MERE PROXIMITY OF A GERMAN RETARDS MY DIGESTION, THE FIRST CONTACT WITH WAGNER WAS ALSO THE FIRST DEEP BREATH OF MY LIFE: I EXPERIENCED, I REVERED HIM AS A FOREIGN LAND, AS AN ANTITHESIS, AS AN INCARNATE PROTEST AGAINST ALL ‚ÄÚGERMAN VIRTUES.‚ÄÙ

WE WHO WERE CHILDREN IN THE SWAMP AIR OF THE FIFTIES ARE OF NECESSITY PESSIMISTS CONCERNING THE CONCEPT ‚ÄÚGERMAN;‚ÄÙ WE SIMPLY CANNOT BE ANYTHING BUT REVOLUTIONARIES‚ÄÎWE SHALL NOT COME TO TERMS WITH ANY STATE OF AFFAIRS IN WHICH THE BIGOT3 IS AT THE TOP. IT IS A MATTER OF TOTAL INDIFFERENCE TO ME WHETHER TODAY HE DONS DIFFERENT COLORS, CLOTHING HIMSELF IN SCARLET AND PUTTING ON A HUSSAR‚ÄÔS UNIFORM.4

WELL THEN! WAGNER WAS A REVOLUTIONARY‚ÄÎHE RAN AWAY FROM THE GERMANS.5

AS AN ARTIST ONE HAS NO HOME IN EUROPE, EXCEPT PARIS: THE D√©LICATESSE IN ALL FIVE ARTISTIC SENSES THAT IS PRESUPPOSED BY WAGNER‚ÄÔS ART, THE FINGERS FOR NUANCES, THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MORBIDITY ARE FOUND ONLY IN PARIS. NOWHERE ELSE DOES ONE HAVE THIS PASSION IN QUESTIONS OF FORM, THIS SERIOUSNESS IN MISE EN SC√®NE6‚ÄÎWHICH IS PARISIAN SERIOUSNESS PAR EXCELLENCE. IN GERMANY PEOPLE SIMPLY LACK ANY NOTION OF THE TREMENDOUS AMBITION THAT LIVES IN THE SOUL OF A PARISIAN ARTIST. GERMANS ARE GOOD-NATURED‚ÄÎWAGNER WAS ANYTHING BUT GOOD-NATURED.

BUT I HAVE LONG SAID ADEQUATELY (IN BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL SECTION 256)7 WHERE WAGNER BELONGS AND WHO ARE HIS CLOSEST RELATIVES: THE LATE FRENCH ROMANTICS, THAT HIGH-FLYING AND YET ROUSING MANNER OF ARTISTS LIKE DELACROIX, LIKE BERLIOZ, WITH A CHARACTERISTIC FOND8 OF SICKNESS, OF INCURABILITY‚ÄÎALL OF THEM FANATICS OF EXPRESSION, VIRTUOSOS THROUGH AND THROUGH.

WHO WAS THE FIRST INTELLIGENT ADHERENT OF WAGNER ANYWHERE? CHARLES BAUDELAIRE, WHO WAS ALSO THE FIRST TO UNDERSTAND DELACROIX‚ÄÎTHAT TYPICAL DECADENT IN WHOM A WHOLE TRIBE OF ARTISTS RECOGNIZED THEMSELVES‚ÄÎAND PERHAPS HE WAS ALSO THE LAST.9

WHAT DID I NEVER FORGIVE WAGNER? THAT HE CONDESCENDED TO THE GERMANS‚ÄÎTHAT HE BECAME REICHSDEUTSCH.10

AS FAR AS GERMANY EXTENDS, SHE CORRUPTS CULTURE.11

ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, I COULD NOT HAVE ENDURED MY YOUTH WITHOUT WAGNER‚ÄÔS MUSIC. FOR I WAS CONDEMNED TO GERMANS. IF ONE WANTS TO RID ONESELF OF AN UNBEARABLE PRESSURE, ONE NEEDS HASHISH. WELL THEN, I NEEDED WAGNER. WAGNER IS THE ANTITOXIN AGAINST EVERYTHING GERMAN PAR EXCELLENCE‚ÄÎA TOXIN, A POISON, THAT I DON‚ÄÔT DENY.

FROM THE MOMENT WHEN THERE WAS A PIANO SCORE OF TRISTAN‚ÄÎMY COMPLIMENTS, HERR VON B√ºLOW‚ÄÎI WAS A WAGNERIAN.1 WAGNER‚ÄÔS OLDER WORKS I DEEMED BENEATH MYSELF‚ÄÎSTILL TOO VULGAR, TOO ‚ÄÚGERMAN.‚ÄÙ

BUT TO THIS DAY I AM STILL LOOKING FOR A WORK THAT EQUALS THE DANGEROUS FASCINATION AND THE GRUESOME2 AND SWEET INFINITY OF TRISTAN‚ÄÎAND LOOK IN ALL THE ARTS IN VAIN. ALL THE STRANGENESSES OF LEONARDO DA VINCI EMERGE FROM THEIR SPELL AT THE FIRST NOTE OF TRISTAN. THIS WORK IS EMPHATICALLY WAGNER‚ÄÔS NON PLUS ULTRA; WITH THE MEISTERSINGER AND THE RING HE RECUPERATED3 FROM IT. BECOMING HEALTHIER‚ÄÎIS A RETROGRESSION, GIVEN A NATURE LIKE WAGNER‚ÄÔS.

I TAKE IT FOR A GOOD FORTUNE OF THE FIRST ORDER THAT I LIVED AT THE RIGHT TIME AND AMONG GERMANS, OF ALL PEOPLES, SO THAT I WAS RIPE FOR THIS WORK: THAT IS HOW FAR THE PSYCHOLOGIST‚ÄÔS INQUISITIVENESS EXTENDS IN MY CASE. THE WORLD IS POOR FOR ANYONE WHO HAS NEVER BEEN SICK ENOUGH FOR THIS ‚ÄÚVOLUPTUOUSNESS OF HELL‚ÄÙ: IT IS PERMITTED, IT IS ALMOST IMPERATIVE, TO EMPLOY A FORMULA OF THE MYSTICS AT THIS POINT.

I THINK I KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE OF WHAT TREMENDOUS THINGS WAGNER IS CAPABLE‚ÄÎTHE FIFTY WORLDS OF ALIEN ECSTASIES FOR WHICH NO ONE BESIDES HIM HAD WINGS; AND GIVEN THE WAY I AM, STRONG ENOUGH TO TURN EVEN WHAT IS MOST QUESTIONABLE AND DANGEROUS TO MY ADVANTAGE AND THUS TO BECOME STRONGER, I CALL WAGNER THE GREAT BENEFACTOR OF MY LIFE. THAT IN WHICH WE ARE RELATED‚ÄÎTHAT WE HAVE SUFFERED MORE PROFOUNDLY, ALSO FROM EACH OTHER, THAN MEN OF THIS CENTURY ARE CAPABLE OF SUFFERING‚ÄÎWILL LINK OUR NAMES AGAIN AND AGAIN, ETERNALLY; AND AS CERTAINLY AS WAGNER IS MERELY A MISUNDERSTANDING AMONG GERMANS, JUST AS CERTAINLY I AM AND ALWAYS SHALL BE.

TWO CENTURIES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND ARTISTIC DISCIPLINE MUST COME FIRST, MY DEAR TEUTONS!‚ÄÎBUT WITH THAT ONE DOES NOT CATCH UP.





7


I SHALL SAY ANOTHER WORD FOR THE MOST SELECT EARS: WHAT I REALLY WANT FROM MUSIC. THAT IT BE CHEERFUL AND PROFOUND LIKE AN AFTERNOON IN OCTOBER. THAT IT BE INDIVIDUAL, FROLICSOME, TENDER, A SWEET SMALL WOMAN FULL OF BEASTLINESS AND CHARM.

I SHALL NEVER ADMIT THAT A GERMAN COULD KNOW WHAT MUSIC IS. THOSE WHO ARE CALLED GERMAN COMPOSERS‚ÄÎTHE GREATEST ABOVE ALL‚ÄÎARE FOREIGNERS: SLAVS, CROATS, ITALIANS, DUTCHMEN‚ÄÎOR JEWS; OTHERWISE, GERMANS OF THE STRONG RACE, EXTINCT GERMANS, LIKE HEINRICH SCH√ºTZ, BACH, AND HANDEL. I MYSELF AM STILL ENOUGH OF A POLE TO SURRENDER THE REST OF MUSIC FOR CHOPIN, EXCEPTING, FOR THREE REASONS, WAGNER‚ÄÔS SIEGFRIED IDYLL, PERHAPS ALSO A FEW THINGS BY LISZT, WHO SURPASSES ALL OTHER MUSICIANS IN HIS NOBLE ORCHESTRAL ACCENTS, AND, FINALLY, EVERYTHING THAT GREW BEYOND THE ALPS‚ÄÎTHIS SIDE.1

I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO GET ALONG WITHOUT ROSSINI; EVEN LESS, WITHOUT MY OWN SOUTH IN MUSIC, THE MUSIC OF MY VENETIAN MAESTRO PIETRO GASTI.2 AND WHEN I SAY BEYOND THE ALPS, I REALLY MERELY SAY VENICE. WHEN I SEEK ANOTHER WORD FOR MUSIC, I ALWAYS FIND ONLY THE WORD VENICE. I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TEARS AND MUSIC‚ÄÎI DO NOT KNOW HOW TO THINK OF HAPPINESS, OF THE SOUTH, WITHOUT SHUDDERS OF TIMIDITY.

AT THE BRIDGE I STOOD

LATELY IN THE BROWN NIGHT.

FROM AFAR CAME A SONG:

AS A GOLDEN DROP IT WELLED

OVER THE QUIVERING SURFACE.

GONDOLAS, LIGHTS, AND MUSIC‚ÄÎ

DRUNKEN IT SWAM OUT INTO THE TWILIGHT.

MY SOUL, A STRINGED INSTRUMENT, SANG TO ITSELF, INVISIBLY TOUCHED, A SECRET GONDOLA SONG, QUIVERING WITH IRIDESCENT HAPPINESS.‚ÄÎDID ANYONE LISTEN TO IT?

IN ALL THESE MATTERS‚ÄÎIN THE CHOICE OF NUTRITION, OF PLACE AND CLIMATE, OF RECREATION‚ÄÎAN INSTINCT OF SELF-PRESERVATION ISSUES ITS COMMANDMENTS, AND IT GAINS ITS MOST UNAMBIGUOUS EXPRESSION AS AN INSTINCT OF SELF-DEFENSE. NOT TO SEE MANY THINGS, NOT TO HEAR MANY THINGS, NOT TO PERMIT MANY THINGS TO COME CLOSE‚ÄÎFIRST IMPERATIVE OF PRUDENCE, FIRST PROOF THAT ONE IS NO MERE ACCIDENT BUT A NECESSITY. THE USUAL WORD FOR THIS INSTINCT OF SELF-DEFENSE IS TASTE. IT COMMANDS US NOT ONLY TO SAY NO WHEN YES WOULD BE ‚ÄÚSELFLESS‚ÄÙ BUT ALSO TO SAY NO AS RARELY AS POSSIBLE. TO DETACH ONESELF, TO SEPARATE ONESELF FROM ANYTHING THAT WOULD MAKE IT NECESSARY TO KEEP SAYING NO. THE REASON IN THIS IS THAT WHEN DEFENSIVE EXPENDITURES, BE THEY EVER SO SMALL, BECOME THE RULE AND A HABIT, THEY ENTAIL AN EXTRAORDINARY AND ENTIRELY SUPERFLUOUS IMPOVERISHMENT. OUR GREAT EXPENSES ARE COMPOSED OF THE MOST FREQUENT SMALL ONES. WARDING OFF, NOT LETTING THINGS COME CLOSE, INVOLVES AN EXPENDITURE‚ÄÎLET NOBODY DECEIVE HIMSELF ABOUT THIS‚ÄÎENERGY WASTED ON NEGATIVE ENDS. MERELY THROUGH THE CONSTANT NEED TO WARD OFF, ONE CAN BECOME WEAK ENOUGH TO BE UNABLE TO DEFEND ONESELF ANY LONGER.

SUPPOSE I STEPPED OUT OF MY HOUSE AND FOUND, INSTEAD OF QUIET, ARISTOCRATIC TURIN, A SMALL GERMAN TOWN: MY INSTINCT WOULD HAVE TO CAST UP A BARRIER TO PUSH BACK EVERYTHING THAT WOULD ASSAIL IT FROM THIS PINCHED AND FLATTENED, COWARDLY WORLD. OR I FOUND A GERMAN BIG CITY‚ÄÎTHIS BUILT-UP VICE WHERE NOTHING GROWS, WHERE EVERYTHING, GOOD OR BAD, IS IMPORTED. WOULDN‚ÄÔT THIS COMPEL ME TO BECOME A HEDGEHOG?

BUT HAVING QUILLS IS A WASTE, EVEN A DOUBLE LUXURY WHEN ONE CAN CHOOSE NOT TO HAVE QUILLS BUT OPEN HANDS.

ANOTHER COUNSEL OF PRUDENCE AND SELF-DEFENSE IS TO REACT AS RARELY AS POSSIBLE, AND TO AVOID SITUATIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS THAT WOULD CONDEMN ONE TO SUSPEND, AS IT WERE, ONE‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚFREEDOM‚ÄÙ AND INITIATIVE AND TO BECOME A MERE REAGENT. AS A PARABLE I CHOOSE ASSOCIATION WITH BOOKS. SCHOLARS WHO AT BOTTOM DO LITTLE NOWADAYS BUT THUMB BOOKS‚ÄÎPHILOLOGISTS, AT A MODERATE ESTIMATE, ABOUT 200 A DAY‚ÄÎULTIMATELY LOSE ENTIRELY THEIR CAPACITY TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES. WHEN THEY DON‚ÄÔT THUMB, THEY DON‚ÄÔT THINK. THEY RESPOND TO A STIMULUS (A THOUGHT THEY HAVE READ) WHENEVER THEY THINK‚ÄÎIN THE END, THEY DO NOTHING BUT REACT. SCHOLARS SPEND ALL OF THEIR ENERGIES ON SAYING YES AND NO, ON CRITICISM OF WHAT OTHERS HAVE THOUGHT‚ÄÎTHEY THEMSELVES NO LONGER THINK.

THE INSTINCT OF SELF-DEFENSE HAS BECOME WORN-OUT IN THEM; OTHERWISE THEY WOULD RESIST BOOKS. THE SCHOLAR‚ÄÎA DECADENT.

I HAVE SEEN THIS WITH MY OWN EYES: GIFTED NATURES WITH A GENEROUS AND FREE DISPOSITION, ‚ÄÚREAD TO RUIN‚ÄÙ IN THEIR THIRTIES‚ÄÎMERELY MATCHES THAT ONE HAS TO STRIKE TO MAKE THEM EMIT SPARKS‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚTHOUGHTS.‚ÄÙ

EARLY IN THE MORNING, WHEN DAY BREAKS, WHEN ALL IS FRESH, IN THE DAWN OF ONE‚ÄÔS STRENGTH‚ÄÎTO READ A BOOK AT SUCH A TIME IS SIMPLY DEPRAVED!

AT THIS POINT THE REAL ANSWER TO THE QUESTION, HOW ONE BECOMES WHAT ONE IS, CAN NO LONGER BE AVOIDED. AND THUS I TOUCH ON THE MASTERPIECE OF THE ART OF SELF-PRESERVATION‚ÄÎOF SELFISHNESS.

FOR LET US ASSUME THAT THE TASK, THE DESTINY, THE FATE OF THE TASK TRANSCENDS THE AVERAGE VERY SIGNIFICANTLY: IN THAT CASE, NOTHING COULD BE MORE DANGEROUS THAN CATCHING SIGHT OF ONESELF WITH THIS TASK. TO BECOME WHAT ONE IS, ONE MUST NOT HAVE THE FAINTEST NOTION WHAT ONE IS. FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW EVEN THE BLUNDERS OF LIFE HAVE THEIR OWN MEANING AND VALUE‚ÄÎTHE OCCASIONAL SIDE ROADS AND WRONG ROADS, THE DELAYS, ‚ÄÚMODESTIES,‚ÄÙ SERIOUSNESS WASTED ON TASKS THAT ARE REMOTE FROM THE TASK. ALL THIS CAN EXPRESS A GREAT PRUDENCE, EVEN THE SUPREME PRUDENCE: WHERE NOSCE TE IPSUM1 WOULD BE THE RECIPE FOR RUIN,2 FORGETTING ONESELF, MISUNDERSTANDING ONESELF, MAKING ONESELF SMALLER, NARROWER, MEDIOCRE, BECOME REASON ITSELF. MORALLY SPEAKING: NEIGHBOR LOVE, LIVING FOR OTHERS, AND OTHER THINGS CAN BE A PROTECTIVE MEASURE FOR PRESERVING THE HARDEST SELF-CONCERN. THIS IS THE EXCEPTION WHERE, AGAINST MY WONT AND CONVICTION, I SIDE WITH THE ‚ÄÚSELFLESS‚ÄÙ DRIVES: HERE THEY WORK IN THE SERVICE OF SELF-LOVE, OF SELF-DISCIPLINE.3

THE WHOLE SURFACE OF CONSCIOUSNESS‚ÄÎCONSCIOUSNESS IS A SURFACE4‚ÄÎMUST BE KEPT CLEAR OF ALL GREAT IMPERATIVES. BEWARE EVEN OF EVERY GREAT WORD, EVERY GREAT POSE! SO MANY DANGERS THAT THE INSTINCT COMES TOO SOON TO ‚ÄÚUNDERSTAND ITSELF‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎ. MEANWHILE THE ORGANIZING ‚ÄÚIDEA‚ÄÙ THAT IS DESTINED TO RULE KEEPS GROWING DEEP DOWN‚ÄÎIT BEGINS TO COMMAND; SLOWLY IT LEADS US BACK FROM SIDE ROADS AND WRONG ROADS; IT PREPARES SINGLE QUALITIES AND FITNESSES THAT WILL ONE DAY PROVE TO BE INDISPENSABLE AS MEANS TOWARD A WHOLE‚ÄÎONE BY ONE, IT TRAINS ALL SUBSERVIENT CAPACITIES BEFORE GIVING ANY HINT OF THE DOMINANT TASK, ‚ÄÚGOAL,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚAIM,‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚMEANING.‚ÄÙ

CONSIDERED IN THIS WAY, MY LIFE IS SIMPLY WONDERFUL. FOR THE TASK OF A REVALUATION OF ALL VALUES MORE CAPACITIES MAY HAVE BEEN NEEDED THAN HAVE EVER DWELT TOGETHER IN A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL‚ÄÎABOVE ALL, EVEN CONTRARY CAPACITIES THAT HAD TO BE KEPT FROM DISTURBING, DESTROYING ONE ANOTHER. AN ORDER OF RANK AMONG THESE CAPACITIES; DISTANCE; THE ART OF SEPARATING WITHOUT SETTING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER; TO MIX NOTHING, TO ‚ÄÚRECONCILE‚ÄÙ NOTHING; A TREMENDOUS VARIETY THAT IS NEVERTHELESS THE OPPOSITE OF CHAOS‚ÄÎTHIS WAS THE PRECONDITION, THE LONG, SECRET WORK AND ARTISTRY OF MY INSTINCT. ITS HIGHER PROTECTION MANIFESTED ITSELF TO SUCH A HIGH DEGREE THAT I NEVER EVEN SUSPECTED WHAT WAS GROWING IN ME‚ÄÎAND ONE DAY ALL MY CAPACITIES, SUDDENLY RIPE, LEAPED FORTH IN THEIR ULTIMATE PERFECTION.5 I CANNOT REMEMBER THAT I EVER TRIED HARD6‚ÄÎNO TRACE OF STRUGGLE CAN BE DEMONSTRATED IN MY LIFE; I AM THE OPPOSITE OF A HEROIC NATURE. ‚ÄÚWILLING‚ÄÙ SOMETHING, ‚ÄÚSTRIVING‚ÄÙ7 FOR SOMETHING, ENVISAGING A ‚ÄÚPURPOSE,‚ÄÙ A ‚ÄÚWISH‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎI KNOW NONE OF THIS FROM EXPERIENCE. AT THIS VERY MOMENT I STILL LOOK UPON MY FUTURE‚ÄÎAN AMPLE FUTURE!‚ÄÎAS UPON CALM SEAS: THERE IS NO RIPPLE OF DESIRE. I DO NOT WANT IN THE LEAST THAT ANYTHING SHOULD BECOME DIFFERENT THAN IT IS; I MYSELF DO NOT WANT TO BECOME DIFFERENT.

BUT THAT IS HOW I HAVE ALWAYS LIVED. I HAD NO WISHES. A MAN OVER FORTY-FOUR WHO CAN SAY THAT HE NEVER STROVE8 FOR HONORS, FOR WOMEN, FOR MONEY!

THUS IT HAPPENED, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT ONE DAY I WAS A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR‚ÄÎNO SUCH IDEA HAD EVER ENTERED MY MIND., FOR I WAS BARELY TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OLD. THUS IT HAPPENED TWO YEARS EARLIER THAT ONE DAY I WAS SUDDENLY A PHILOLOGIST‚ÄÎINSOFAR AS MY FIRST PHILOLOGICAL ESSAY, MY BEGINNING IN EVERY SENSE, WAS REQUESTED BY MY TEACHER, RITSCHL, FOR PUBLICATION IN HIS RHEINISCHES MUSEUM.9 (RITSCHL‚ÄÎI SAY IT WITH REVERENCE‚ÄÎTHE ONLY SCHOLAR OF GENIUS ON WHOM I HAVE LAID EYES TO THIS DAY. HE WAS CHARACTERIZED BY THAT AGREEABLE CORRUPTION WHICH DISTINGUISHES US THURINGIANS AND WHICH MAKES EVEN GERMANS SYMPATHETIC: EVEN TO REACH TRUTH, WE STILL PREFER FURTIVE PATHS. THESE WORDS ARE NOT MEANT TO UNDERESTIMATE MY CLOSE COMPATRIOT, THE CLEVER LEOPOLD VON RANKE‚ÄÎ.)10

ONE WILL ASK ME WHY ON EARTH I‚ÄÔVE BEEN RELATING ALL THESE SMALL THINGS WHICH ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED MATTERS OF COMPLETE INDIFFERENCE: I ONLY HARM MYSELF, THE MORE SO IF I AM DESTINED TO REPRESENT GREAT TASKS. ANSWER: THESE SMALL THINGS‚ÄÎNUTRITION, PLACE, CLIMATE, RECREATION, THE WHOLE CASUISTRY OF SELFISHNESS‚ÄÎARE INCONCEIVABLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVERYTHING ONE HAS TAKEN TO BE IMPORTANT SO FAR. PRECISELY HERE ONE MUST BEGIN TO RELEARN. WHAT MANKIND HAS SO FAR CONSIDERED SERIOUSLY HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN REALITIES BUT MERE IMAGININGS‚ÄÎMORE STRICTLY SPEAKING, LIES PROMPTED BY THE BAD INSTINCTS OF SICK NATURES THAT WERE HARMFUL IN THE MOST PROFOUND SENSE‚ÄÎALL THESE CONCEPTS, ‚ÄÚGOD,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚSOUL,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚVIRTUE,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚSIN,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚBEYOND,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚTRUTH,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚETERNAL LIFE.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎBUT THE GREATNESS OF HUMAN NATURE, ITS ‚ÄÚDIVINITY,‚ÄÙ WAS SOUGHT IN THEM.‚ÄÎALL THE PROBLEMS OF POLITICS, OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATION, AND OF EDUCATION HAVE BEEN FALSIFIED THROUGH AND THROUGH BECAUSE ONE MISTOOK THE MOST HARMFUL MEN FOR GREAT MEN‚ÄÎBECAUSE ONE LEARNED TO DESPISE ‚ÄÚLITTLE‚ÄÙ THINGS, WHICH MEANS THE BASIC CONCERNS OF LIFE ITSELF.1

WHEN I NOW COMPARE MYSELF WITH THE MEN WHO HAVE SO FAR BEEN HONORED AS THE FIRST, THE DIFFERENCE IS PALPABLE. I DO NOT EVEN COUNT THESE SO-CALLED ‚ÄÚFIRST‚ÄÙ MEN AMONG MEN IN GENERAL: FOR ME THEY ARE THE REFUSE OF HUMANITY, MONSTERS OF SICKNESS AND VENGEFUL INSTINCTS; THEY ARE INHUMAN, DISASTROUS, AT BOTTOM INCURABLE, AND REVENGE THEMSELVES ON LIFE.

I WANT TO BE THEIR OPPOSITE: IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO HAVE THE SUBTLEST SENSITIVITY FOR ALL SIGNS OF HEALTHY INSTINCTS. THERE IS NO PATHOLOGICAL TRAIT IN ME; EVEN IN PERIODS OF SEVERE SICKNESS I NEVER BECAME PATHOLOGICAL; IN VAIN WOULD ONE SEEK FOR A TRAIT OF FANATICISM IN MY CHARACTER. THERE IS NOT A MOMENT IN MY LIFE TO WHICH ONE COULD POINT TO CONVICT ME OF A PRESUMPTUOUS AND PATHETIC2 POSTURE. THE PATHOS OF POSES DOES NOT BELONG TO GREATNESS; WHOEVER NEEDS POSES AT ALL IS FALSE.‚ÄÎBEWARE OF ALL PICTURESQUE MEN!

LIFE WAS EASY FOR ME‚ÄÎEASIEST WHEN IT MADE THE HARDEST DEMANDS ON ME. WHOEVER SAW ME DURING THE SEVENTY DAYS THIS FALL WHEN, WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, I DID SEVERAL THINGS OF THE FIRST RANK THE LIKE OF WHICH NOBODY WILL DO AFTER ME‚ÄÎOR IMPOSE ON ME3‚ÄÎWITH A RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL MILLENNIA AFTER ME, WILL NOT HAVE NOTICED ANY TRACE OF TENSION IN ME; BUT RATHER AN OVERFLOWING FRESHNESS AND CHEERFULNESS. I NEVER ATE WITH MORE PLEASANT FEELINGS; I NEVER SLEPT BETTER.

I DO NOT KNOW ANY OTHER WAY OF ASSOCIATING WITH GREAT TASKS THAN PLAY: AS A SIGN OF GREATNESS, THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL PRESUPPOSITION. THE LEAST COMPULSION, A GLOOMY MIEN, OR ANY HARSH TONE IN THE THROAT ARE ALL OBJECTIONS TO A MAN; HOW MUCH MORE AGAINST HIS WORK!‚ÄÎONE MUST NOT HAVE ANY NERVES.‚ÄÎSUFFERING FROM SOLITUDE IS ALSO AN OBJECTION‚ÄÎI HAVE SUFFERED ONLY FROM ‚ÄÚMULTITUDES.‚ÄÙ

AT AN ABSURDLY EARLY AGE, AT SEVEN, I ALREADY KNEW THAT NO HUMAN WORD WOULD EVER REACH ME: HAS ANYONE EVER SEEN ME SADDENED ON THAT ACCOUNT?

TO THIS DAY I STILL HAVE THE SAME AFFABILITY FOR EVERYONE; I EVEN TREAT WITH SPECIAL RESPECT THOSE WHO ARE LOWLIEST: IN ALL OF THIS THERE IS NOT ONE GRAIN OF ARROGANCE OR SECRET CONTEMPT. IF I DESPISE A MAN, HE GUESSES THAT I DESPISE HIM: BY MY MERE EXISTENCE I OUTRAGE EVERYTHING THAT HAS BAD BLOOD IN ITS VEINS.

MY FORMULA FOR GREATNESS IN A HUMAN BEING IS AMOR FATI:4 THAT ONE WANTS NOTHING TO BE DIFFERENT, NOT FORWARD, NOT BACKWARD, NOT IN ALL ETERNITY. NOT MERELY BEAR WHAT IS NECESSARY, STILL LESS CONCEAL IT‚ÄÎALL IDEALISM IS MENDACIOUSNESS IN THE FACE OF WHAT IS NECESSARY‚ÄÎBUT LOVE IT.

IN A SENSE, OF COURSE, HE DOES KNOW ATHEISM ‚ÄÚAS AN EVENT;‚ÄÙ NAMELY, AS A CULTURAL EVENT WHICH HE DESIGNATED WITH THE WORDS, ‚ÄÚGOD IS DEAD‚ÄÙ (GAY SCIENCE, SECTION 125; ZARATHUSTRA, PROLOGUE, SECTION 2: PORTABLE NIETZSCHE).

1THIS WOULD TAKE US BACK TO THE SPRING OF 1861 WHEN NIETZSCHE WAS SIXTEEN. INDEED, THE TEXT OF ONE OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS OWN COMPOSITIONS, DATED JUNE 1861, ‚ÄÚINCLUDED AN UNMISTAKABLE TOKEN OF THE PROXIMITY OF TRISTAN UND ISOLDE: ‚ÄÒWILD WOGT DER WAHN, WO DURCH BEWEGT, DAS WUNDER WOLLEND MEIN GEM√ºTH? [SIC]‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ (FREDERICK R. LOVE, YOUNG NIETZSCHE AND THE WAGNERIAN EXPERIENCE, CHAPEL HILL, N. C, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA PRESS, 1963; REVIEWED BY WALTER KAUFMANN IN JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY, OCTOBER 1965). THE QUOTED PASSAGE READS LIKE A PARODY OF WAGNER AND MAKES LITTLE SENSE: ‚ÄÚWILDLY ILLUSION SURGES, WHEREBY MOVES THE WONDER WISHING MY BOSOM?‚ÄÙ

NEVERTHELESS, LOVE, MAKING USE OF UNPUBLISHED MATERIALS, INCLUDING NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS COMPOSITIONS, ARGUES CONVINCINGLY THAT NIETZSCHE NEVER WAS ‚ÄÚA PASSIONATE DEVOTEE OF WAGNERIAN MUSIC‚ÄÙ (P. VIII). HE FINALS ‚ÄÚNOTHING WHATEVER WAGNERIAN‚ÄÙ IN NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS SONGS BETWEEN 1862 AND 1865 (P. 28); HE CITES A LETTER OF THE WINTER 1865-66 IN WHICH NIETZSCHE, THEN A STUDENT, WROTE, ‚ÄÚTHREE THINGS ARE MY RECREATIONS, BUT RARE RECREATIONS, MY SCHOPENHAUER, SCHUMANN‚ÄÔS MUSIC, FINALLY LONG WALKS;‚ÄÙ AND HE CITES A LIST NIETZSCHE MADE AROUND THE SAME TIME OF HIS MUSICAL FAVORITES: SCHUMANN, BEETHOVEN, AND SCHUBERT ARE MOST PROMINENT, ‚ÄÚTWO CHORAL WORKS BY BACH ARE MENTIONED, ‚ÄÒEIN PAAR‚ÄÔ [A COUPLE OF] LIEDER OF BRAHMS, AND OF WAGNER ONLY THE EARLY OPERA TANNH√§USER, LISTED INDISCRIMINATELY NEXT TO A WORK BY MEYERBEER‚ÄÙ (P. 35).

LOVE ARGUES FURTHER: ‚ÄÚAS FOR WAGNER‚ÄÔS MUSIC, IT CAN BE STATED UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT DIE MEISTERSINGER WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE MATURE WORKS WHICH NIETZSCHE ACQUIRED FULLY ON HIS OWN AND THE ONE WHICH HE KNEW BEST FROM ACTUAL PERFORMANCE‚ÄÙ (P. 63). TRISTAN HE HEARD ONLY TWICE, IN JUNE 1872, IN MUNICH, WHERE ‚ÄÚHANS VON B√ºLOW GAVE THE EUROPEAN MUSICAL PUBLIC ITS SECOND CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE A PRODUCTION OF TRISTAN‚ÄÙ (P. 64). LOVE THINKS THAT TRISTAN ‚ÄÚBECAME FOR NIETZSCHE THE PERMANENT SYMBOL OF HIS UNFORGETTABLE TRIBSCHEN EXPERIENCE‚ÄÙ BECAUSE ‚ÄÚWAGNER HIMSELF MUST HAVE OPENED HIS MIND TO THE DEEPER MEANING OF HIS MOST RADICAL WORK‚ÄÙ (P. 65).

LOVE FAILS TO NOTE THAT NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS TRIBUTE TO VON B√ºLOW IN THE TEXT ABOVE EVIDENTLY CONFLATES TWO EVENTS: THE ONE IN 1861 TO WHICH NIETZSCHE ALLUDES, AND THE OTHER IN 1872. LOVE ALSO REFERS TO (P. 69) BUT DOES NOT QUOTE VON B√ºLOW‚ÄÔS SCATHING LETTER TO NIETZSCHE ABOUT ONE OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS COMPOSITIONS. IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT NIETZSCHE CITES THIS LETTER IN SECTION 4 ABOVE, HUMOROUSLY, WITHOUT ANY TRACE OF RESSENTIMENT, AND THAT HE GOES OUT OF HIS WAY IN THE TEXT ABOVE TO VOICE HIS GRATITUDE TO VON B√ºLOW.

REGARDING NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS RELATIONSHIP TO WAGNER‚ÄÔS MUSIC, LOVE IS SURELY RIGHT IN NOT REGARDING NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS BREAK WITH WAGNER AS AN ACT OF SELF-BETRAYAL (AS MANY WAGNERIANS HAVE DONE), CONCLUDING INSTEAD THAT ‚ÄÚNIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS INFATUATION WITH WAGNERIAN MUSIC ‚Ä¶ MAY INDEED BE REGARDED AS AN ABERRATION‚ÄÙ FROM HIS OWN LINE. BUT AGAIN IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT NIETZSCHE MAKES A POINT OF SPEAKING OF WAGNER WITHOUT RESSENTIMENT AND WITH GRATITUDE; AND IT IS OBVIOUSLY POSSIBLE TO HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO HEAR DIE MEISTERSINGER AND EVEN, WHETHER THIS IS TRUE IN NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CASE OR NOT, TO KNOW AND IN SOME SENSE LIKE THIS OPERA ESPECIALLY WELL, WHILE YET CONSIDERING TRISTAN ‚ÄÚWAGNER‚ÄÔS NON PLUS ULTRA.‚ÄÙ

NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS JUDGMENTS IN ECCE HOMO ARE PLAINLY HIGHLY STYLIZED: HE LOVES WAGNER‚ÄÎIN SPITE OF HIS TEUTONOMANIA, IN SPITE OF HIS IDEAS AND HIS SELF-IMAGE, IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING THAT EVENTUALLY ENDEARED HIM TO HIS COUNTRYMEN; HE LOVES WAGNER AS THE ULTIMATE IN DECADENCE, AS A KIND OF APOTHEOSIS OF FRENCH ROMANTICISM, AS FASCINATINGLY SICK‚ÄÎAND TRISTAN FITS INTO THAT PICTURE A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER THAN DIE MEISTERSINGER.

1NIETZSCHE SPENT HIS SUMMERS IN SWITZERLAND, HIS WINTERS IN ITALY, AND WROTE ECCE HOMO IN TURIN.

2HEINRICH K√∂SELITZ, A YOUNG COMPOSER WHO VASTLY ADMIRED NIETZSCHE, HELPED HIM PREPARE COPIES OF HIS MANUSCRIPTS FOR THE PRINTER, READ PROOFS FOR HIM, AND ASSISTED HIM VERY DEVOTEDLY. NIETZSCHE CALLED HIM PETER GAST, AND THIS BECAME HIS PEN NAME WHEN HE LATER BECAME ONE OF THE EDITORS OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS WORKS. HIS OPERA, ‚ÄÚTHE LION OF VENICE,‚ÄÙ NEVER MADE A REPUTATION FOR HIM AS A COMPOSER, BUT NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS LETTERS TO GAST (1908) MADE HIM FAMOUS. HIS OWN LETTERS TO NIETZSCHE (2 VOLS., 1923-24) ARE MUCH LESS INTERESTING AND NOT AT ALL WIDELY KNOWN. THE PASSAGE IN THE TEXT IS PLAINLY INSPIRED BY GRATITUDE AND TO THAT EXTENT OFFERS A CLUE TO SOME OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS OTHER JUDGMENTS IN ECCE HOMO: HE IS OFTEN MORE CONCERNED WITH HIS OWN ATTITUDES AND THEIR FITTINGNESS, THEIR STYLE, THAN WITH THEIR LITERAL CONTENT.

10THE GREAT HISTORIAN (1795‚ÄÌ1886) WAS BORN IN WIEHE, IN THURINGIA, ROUGHLY THIRTY MILES WEST OF R√¥CKEN (NEAR L√ºTZEN), WHERE NIETZSCHE WAS BORN. AND RANKE, LIKE NIETZSCHE, GOT HIS SECONDARY SCHOOL EDUCATION AT SCHULPFORTA.

1PODACH (FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHES WERKE, 1961) REPRODUCES A PHOTOGRAPH OF SECTION 10 (PLATE XV) AND POINTS OUT THAT THE SPIRAL SCRIBBLE USED TO DELETE THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE AT THIS POINT WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS SISTER AND NEVER EMPLOYED BY HIM (P. 408; CF. ALSO PP. 245F.).

‚ÄÚOUR PRESENT CULTURE IS AMBIGUOUS IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE.‚ÄÎTHE GERMAN EMPEROR MAKING A PACT WITH THE POPE, AS IF THE POPE WERE NOT THE REPRESENTATIVE OF DEADLY HOSTILITY TO LIFE!‚ÄÎWHAT IS BEING BUILT TODAY WILL NO LONGER STAND IN THREE YEARS.‚ÄÎWHEN I MEASURE MYSELF AGAINST MY ABILITY, NOT TO SPEAK OF WHAT WILL COME AFTER ME, A COLLAPSE, A CONSTRUCTION WITHOUT EQUAL, THEN I MORE THAN ANY OTHER MORTAL HAVE A CLAIM TO THE EPITHET OF GREATNESS.‚ÄÙ

IN THE FIRST EDITION OF ECCE HOMO (1908) THIS PARAGRAPH WAS PRINTED IN A FOOTNOTE IN RAOUL RICHTER‚ÄÔS POSTSCRIPT (PP. 147F.) AND INTRODUCED WITH THE FOLLOWING COMMENT: ‚ÄÚTHERE ARE ONLY TWO PASSAGES OF ANY LENGTH WHERE THE PECULIARITY OF THE CROSSING OUT AND PETER GAST‚ÄÔS TESTIMONY, BASED ON HIS RECOLLECTION, MAKE IT MERELY PROBABLE THAT THE DELETION WAS NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS OWN.‚ÄÙ THE OTHER PASSAGE WILL BE FOUND AT THE END OF THE DISCUSSION OF ‚ÄÚTHE CASE OF WAGNER,‚ÄÙ BELOW.

2PATHETISCH IN GERMAN IS CLOSER IN MEANING TO BOMBASTIC THAN IT IS TO PITIFUL. THE WORD IS READILY ASSOCIATED WITH AN ACTOR‚ÄÔS STYLE AND WITH HIGHLY IDEALISTIC PASSAGES IN DRAMA‚ÄÎIN SCHILLER‚ÄÔS PLAYS, FOR EXAMPLE‚ÄÎWHERE BIG WORDS ARE USED FREELY AND A LAUGH WOULD PUNCTURE THE WHOLE EFFECT. THE SAME CONSIDERATION APPLIES TO PATHOS IN THE NEXT SENTENCE.

ONE MAY WONDER WHETHER THIS WHOLE PARAGRAPH IS STARKLY IRONICAL OR, ON THE CONTRARY, TOTALLY LACKING IN SELF-AWARENESS. WITHOUT DENYING THAT BOTH ALTERNATIVES CONTAIN A GRAIN OF TRUTH, ONE MAY INSIST THAT NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CENTRAL POINT IS IMPORTANT. HE NEVER LOST THE ABILITY TO LAUGH, AND HIS SELF-IMAGE WAS THE VERY ANTITHESIS OF HIS SISTER‚ÄÔS LATER IMAGE OF HIM WHICH, AT HER BIDDING, WAS TRANSLATED INTO PICTURES AND SCULPTURES THAT SHE COMMISSIONED AND FOR WHICH SHE POSED HER BROTHER WHO WAS BY THEN A HELPLESS INVALID.

FINALLY, IF WE TAKE SERIOUSLY NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS WORDS, ‚ÄÚNOT A MOMENT IN MY LIFE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAS DISTINGUISHED FROM ‚ÄÚNOT A LINE IN THIS BOOK‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHE IS INCONTESTABLY RIGHT. CONSIDER HOW DR. PANETH, ONE OF FREUD‚ÄÔS FRIENDS, DESCRIBED NIETZSCHE OF WHOM HE SAW A GREAT DEAL IN NIZZA FROM DECEMBER 26, 1883, UNTIL MARCH 26, 1884: ‚ÄÚTHERE IS NOT A TRACE OF FALSE PATHOS OR THE PROPHET‚ÄÔS POSE IN HIM, AS I HAD RATHER FEARED AFTER HIS LAST WORK. INSTEAD HIS MANNER IS COMPLETELY INOFFENSIVE AND NATURAL‚Ä¶. HE TOLD ME, BUT WITHOUT THE LEAST AFFECTATION OR CONCEIT, THAT HE ALWAYS FELT HIMSELF TO HAVE A TASK ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ FOR FURTHER QUOTATIONS FROM HIS LETTERS AND SOME DISCUSSION, SEE WALTER KAUFMANN, FROM SHAKESPEARE TO EXISTENTIALISM (GARDEN CITY, N.Y., DOUBLEDAY ANCHOR BOOKS, 1960).

3DIE KEIN MENSCH MIR NACHMACHT‚ÄÎODER VORMACHT ‚Ä¶ IF NIETZSCHE MEANT‚ÄÎAND THIS POSSIBILITY CANNOT BE RULED OUT‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚOR HAS DONE BEFORE ME,‚ÄÙ THE TEXT OUGHT TO READ: ODER MIR VORGEMACHT HAT.

4LOVE OF FATE. IT SHOULD BE NOTED HOW ECCE HOMO EXEMPLIFIES THIS ATTITUDE. AS LONG AS ONE OVERLOOKS THIS, AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS LIFE FOR THE PRECEDING DECADE, AND MORE, HAD BEEN TROUBLED BY CONTINUED ILL HEALTH AND EXCRUCIATING PHYSICAL PAIN, AND THAT HIS BOOKS WERE, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, TOTALLY ‚ÄÚUNSUCCESSFUL,‚ÄÙ ONE DOES NOT BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND ECCE HOMO.





WHY I WRITE SUCH GOOD BOOKS





1


I AM ONE THING, MY WRITINGS ARE ANOTHER MATTER.‚ÄÎBEFORE I DISCUSS THEM, ONE BY ONE, LET ME TOUCH ON THE QUESTION OF THEIR BEING UNDERSTOOD OR NOT UNDERSTOOD. I‚ÄÔLL DO IT AS CASUALLY AS DECENCY PERMITS; FOR THE TIME FOR THIS QUESTION CERTAINLY HASN‚ÄÔT COME YET. THE TIME FOR ME HASN‚ÄÔT COME YET: SOME ARE BORN POSTHUMOUSLY.

SOME DAY INSTITUTIONS WILL BE NEEDED IN WHICH MEN LIVE AND TEACH AS I CONCEIVE OF LIVING AND TEACHING; IT MIGHT EVEN HAPPEN THAT A FEW CHAIRS WILL THEN BE SET ASIDE FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF ZARATHUSTRA. BUT IT WOULD CONTRADICT MY CHARACTER ENTIRELY IF I EXPECTED EARS AND HANDS FOR MY TRUTHS TODAY: THAT TODAY ONE DOESN‚ÄÔT HEAR ME AND DOESN‚ÄÔT ACCEPT MY IDEAS IS NOT ONLY UNDERSTANDABLE, IT EVEN SEEMS RIGHT TO ME. I DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO BE CONFOUNDED WITH OTHERS‚ÄÎNOT EVEN BY MYSELF.

TO REPEAT, ONE CANNOT FIND MANY TRACES OF ILL WILL IN MY LIFE; AND OF LITERARY ILL WILL, TOO, I COULD SCARCELY RELATE A SINGLE CASE. BUT ONLY TOO MANY OF PURE FOOLISHNESS!

TO ME IT SEEMS ONE OF THE RAREST DISTINCTIONS THAT A MAN CAN ACCORD HIMSELF IF HE TAKES ONE OF MY BOOKS INTO HIS HANDS‚ÄÎI EVEN SUPPOSE THAT HE FIRST TAKES OFF HIS SHOES,1 NOT TO SPEAK OF BOOTS.

WHEN DR. HEINRICH VON STEIN ONCE COMPLAINED VERY HONESTLY THAT HE DIDN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND A WORD OF MY ZARATHUSTRA, I TOLD HIM THAT THIS WAS PERFECTLY IN ORDER: HAVING UNDERSTOOD SIX SENTENCES FROM IT‚ÄÎTHAT IS, TO HAVE REALLY EXPERIENCED THEM‚ÄÎWOULD RAISE ONE TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF EXISTENCE THAN ‚ÄÚMODERN‚ÄÙ MEN COULD ATTAIN. GIVEN THIS FEELING OF DISTANCE, HOW COULD I POSSIBLY WISH TO BE READ BY THOSE ‚ÄÚMODERNS‚ÄÙ WHOM I KNOW!

MY TRIUMPH IS PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE OF SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÔS: I SAY, ‚ÄÚNON LEGOR, NON LEGAR!‚ÄÙ2

NOT THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO UNDERESTIMATE THE PLEASURE I HAVE FELT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AT THE INNOCENCE OF PEOPLE WHO SAID NO TO MY WRITINGS. ONLY THIS PAST SUMMER, AT A TIME WHEN I MAY HAVE UPSET THE BALANCE OF THE WHOLE REST OF LITERATURE WITH MY WEIGHTY, TOO WEIGHTY, LITERATURE, A PROFESSOR FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN SUGGESTED VERY AMIABLY THAT I OUGHT TO TRY ANOTHER FORM: NOBODY READ SUCH THINGS.

IN THE LAST ANALYSIS, IT WAS NOT GERMANY BUT SWITZERLAND THAT PRODUCED THE TWO EXTREME CASES. AN ESSAY BY DR. V. WIDMANN IN THE BUND, ABOUT BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, UNDER THE TITLE ‚ÄÚNIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS DANGEROUS BOOK,‚ÄÙ AND A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT ABOUT MY BOOKS IN GENERAL BY KARL SPITTELER,3 ALSO IN THE BUND, REPRESENT A MAXIMUM IN MY LIFE‚ÄÎI REFRAIN FROM SAYING, OF WHAT.

THE LATTER TREATED MY ZARATHUSTRA, FOR EXAMPLE, AS AN ADVANCED EXERCISE IN STYLE, AND EXPRESSED THE WISH THAT LATER ON I MIGHT PROVIDE SOME CONTENT AS WELL. DR. WIDMANN EXPRESSED HIS RESPECT FOR THE COURAGE I HAD SHOWN IN MY ATTEMPT TO ABOLISH ALL DECENT FEELINGS.4

AS THE PETTY SPITE OF ACCIDENT WOULD HAVE IT, EVERY SENTENCE IN THIS LATTER PIECE WAS, WITH A CONSISTENCY I ADMIRED, SOME TRUTH STOOD ON ITS HEAD: ONE REALLY HAD TO DO NO MORE THAN ‚ÄÚREVALUE ALL VALUES‚ÄÙ IN ORDER TO HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD ABOUT ME IN A TRULY REMARKABLE MANNER‚ÄÎINSTEAD OF HITTING MY HEAD WITH A NAIL.‚ÄÎTHAT MAKES AN EXPLANATION ONLY MORE DESIRABLE.

ULTIMATELY, NOBODY CAN GET MORE OUT OF THINGS, INCLUDING BOOKS, THAN HE ALREADY KNOWS. FOR WHAT ONE LACKS ACCESS TO FROM EXPERIENCE ONE WILL HAVE NO EAR. NOW LET US IMAGINE AN EXTREME CASE: THAT A BOOK SPEAKS OF NOTHING BUT EVENTS THAT LIE ALTOGETHER BEYOND THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY FREQUENT OR EVEN RARE EXPERIENCE‚ÄÎTHAT IT IS THE FIRST LANGUAGE FOR A NEW SERIES OF EXPERIENCES. IN THAT CASE, SIMPLY NOTHING WILL BE HEARD, BUT THERE WILL BE THE ACOUSTIC ILLUSION THAT WHERE NOTHING IS HEARD, NOTHING IS THERE.

THIS IS, IN THE END, MY AVERAGE EXPERIENCE AND, IF YOU WILL, THE ORIGINALITY OF MY EXPERIENCE. WHOEVER THOUGHT HE HAD UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING OF ME, HAD MADE UP SOMETHING OUT OF ME AFTER HIS OWN IMAGE‚ÄÎNOT UNCOMMONLY AN ANTITHESIS TO ME; FOR EXAMPLE, AN ‚ÄÚIDEALIST‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND WHOEVER HAD UNDERSTOOD NOTHING OF ME, DENIED THAT I NEED BE CONSIDERED AT ALL.

THE WORD ‚ÄÚOVERMAN,‚ÄÙ AS THE DESIGNATION OF A TYPE OF SUPREME ACHIEVEMENT, AS OPPOSED TO ‚ÄÚMODERN‚ÄÙ MEN, TO ‚ÄÚGOOD‚ÄÙ MEN, TO CHRISTIANS AND OTHER NIHILISTS‚ÄÎA WORD THAT IN THE MOUTH OF A ZARATHUSTRA, THE ANNIHILATOR OF MORALITY, BECOMES A VERY PENSIVE WORD‚ÄÎHAS BEEN UNDERSTOOD ALMOST EVERYWHERE WITH THE UTMOST INNOCENCE IN THE SENSE OF THOSE VERY VALUES WHOSE OPPOSITE ZARATHUSTRA WAS MEANT TO REPRESENT‚ÄÎTHAT IS, AS AN ‚ÄÚIDEALISTIC‚ÄÙ TYPE OF A HIGHER KIND OF MAN, HALF ‚ÄÚSAINT,‚ÄÙ HALF ‚ÄÚGENIUS.‚ÄÙ

OTHER SCHOLARLY OXEN HAVE SUSPECTED ME OF DARWINISM ON THAT ACCOUNT. EVEN THE ‚ÄÚHERO WORSHIP‚ÄÙ OF THAT UNCONSCIOUS AND INVOLUNTARY CONTERFEITER, CARLYLE, WHICH I HAVE REPUDIATED SO MALICIOUSLY, HAS BEEN READ INTO IT. THOSE TO WHOM I SAID IN CONFIDENCE THAT THEY SHOULD SOONER LOOK EVEN FOR A CESARE BORGIA THAN FOR A PARSIFAL, DID NOT BELIEVE THEIR OWN EARS.5

THAT I FEEL NO CURIOSITY AT ALL ABOUT REVIEWS OF MY BOOKS, ESPECIALLY IN NEWSPAPERS, SHOULD BE FORGIVEN ME. MY FRIENDS AND MY PUBLISHERS KNOW THIS AND DO NOT SPEAK TO ME ABOUT SUCH THINGS. IN ONE PARTICULAR CASE I ONCE DID GET TO SEE ALL THE SINS THAT HAD BEEN COMMITTED AGAINST ONE OF MY BOOKS‚ÄÎIT WAS BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL‚ÄÎAND I COULD MAKE A PRETTY REPORT ABOUT THAT. WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT? THE NATIONALZEITUNG‚ÄÎA PRUSSIAN NEWSPAPER, AS I MIGHT EXPLAIN FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY FOREIGN READERS‚ÄÎI MYSELF READ, IF I MAY SAY SO, ONLY THE JOURNAL DES D√©BATS‚ÄÎACTUALLY MANAGED TO UNDERSTAND THE BOOK AS A ‚ÄÚSIGN OF THE TIMES,‚ÄÙ AS THE REAL AND GENUINE JUNKER PHILOSOPHY FOR WHICH THE KREUZZEITUNG6 MERELY LACKED THE COURAGE.





2


THIS WAS SAID FOR THE BENEFIT OF GERMANS; FOR EVERYWHERE ELSE I HAVE READERS‚ÄÎNOTHING BUT FIRST-RATE INTELLECTS AND PROVEN CHARACTERS, TRAINED IN HIGH POSITIONS AND DUTIES; I EVEN HAVE REAL GENIUSES AMONG MY READERS. IN VIENNA, IN ST. PETERSBURG, IN STOCKHOLM, IN COPENHAGEN, IN PARIS, IN NEW YORK‚ÄÎEVERYWHERE I HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED; BUT NOT IN THE SHALLOWS OF EUROPE, GERMANY.1

AND LET ME CONFESS THAT MY NONREADERS DELIGHT ME EVEN MORE‚ÄÎTHOSE WHO HAVE NEVER HEARD MY NAME, NOR THE WORD ‚ÄÚPHILOSOPHY.‚ÄÙ BUT WHEREVER I GO, HERE IN TURIN, FOR EXAMPLE, EVERYBODY‚ÄÔS FACE LIGHTS UP AND LOOKS PLEASED AT MY SIGHT. WHAT HAS FLATTERED ME MOST SO FAR IS THAT OLD COSTERMONGER WOMEN WON‚ÄÔT RELAX UNTIL THEY HAVE FOUND THEIR SWEETEST GRAPES FOR ME. THAT IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH ONE SHOULD BE A PHILOSOPHER.

IT IS NOT FOR NOTHING THAT THE POLES ARE CALLED THE FRENCHMEN AMONG THE SLAVS. A CHARMING RUSSIAN WOMAN WOULD NOT DOUBT FOR A MOMENT WHERE I BELONG. I CANNOT BE SOLEMN, AT MOST I BECOME EMBARRASSED.

TO THINK GERMAN, TO FEEL GERMAN‚ÄÎI CAN DO ANYTHING, BUT NOT THAT.

MY OLD TEACHER, RITSCHL, ACTUALLY CLAIMED THAT I PLANNED EVEN MY PHILOLOGICAL ESSAYS LIKE A PARISIAN ROMANCIER‚ÄÎABSURDLY EXCITING. EVEN IN PARIS THEY ARE AMAZED BY ‚ÄÚTOUT MES AUDACES ET FINESSES‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHIS IS M. TAINE‚ÄÔS EXPRESSION.2 I FEAR THAT EVEN INTO THE HIGHEST FORMS OF THE DITHYRAMB ONE FINDS IN MY CASE SOME ADMIXTURE OF THAT SALT WHICH NEVER LOSES ITS SAVOR AND BECOMES FLAT‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚGERMAN‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎNAMELY, ESPRIT.‚ÄÎI CANNOT DO OTHERWISE. GOD HELP ME! AMEN.3

ALL OF US KNOW, SOME EVEN KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE, WHICH ANIMAL HAS LONG EARS. WELL THEN, I DARE ASSERT THAT I HAVE THE SMALLEST EARS. THIS IS OF NO SMALL INTEREST TO WOMEN‚ÄÎIT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY MAY FEEL I UNDERSTAND THEM BETTER.‚ÄÎI AM THE ANTI-ASS PAR EXCELLENCE AND THUS A WORLD-HISTORICAL MONSTER‚ÄÎI AM, IN GREEK, AND NOT ONLY IN GREEK, THE ANTICHRIST.





3


I HAVE SOME NOTION OF MY PRIVILEGES AS A WRITER; IN A FEW INSTANCES I HAVE BEEN TOLD, TOO, HOW GETTING USED TO MY WRITINGS ‚ÄÚSPOILS‚ÄÙ ONE‚ÄÔS TASTE. ONE SIMPLY CAN NO LONGER ENDURE OTHER BOOKS, LEAST OF ALL PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS. IT IS A DISTINCTION WITHOUT EQUAL TO ENTER THIS NOBLE AND DELICATE WORLD‚ÄÎONE MUST NOT BY ANY MEANS BE A GERMAN; IT IS AFTER ALL A DISTINCTION ONE MUST HAVE EARNED. BUT WHOEVER IS RELATED TO ME IN THE HEIGHT OF HIS ASPIRATIONS WILL EXPERIENCE VERITABLE ECSTASIES OF LEARNING; FOR I COME FROM HEIGHTS THAT NO BIRD EVER REACHED IN ITS FLIGHT, I KNOW ABYSSES INTO WHICH NO FOOT EVER STRAYED. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT DOWN ONE OF MY BOOKS‚ÄÎTHAT I EVEN DISTURB NIGHTLY REST.

ALTOGETHER, THERE IS NO PROUDER AND AT THE SAME TIME SUBTLER TYPE OF BOOK: HERE AND THERE THEY ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST THING ACHIEVABLE ON EARTH, CYNICISM; THEY HAVE TO BE CONQUERED WITH THE MOST DELICATE FINGERS AS WELL AS THE BRAVEST FISTS. EVERY FRAILTY OF THE SOUL EXCLUDES ONE ONCE AND FOR ALL, EVEN EVERY KIND OF DYSPEPSIA: ONE MUST NOT HAVE ANY NERVES, ONE NEEDS A CHEERFUL DIGESTION. NOT ONLY THE POVERTY, ALSO THE NOOK AIR OF A SOUL EXCLUDES ONE; EVEN MORE, ANY COWARDICE, UNCLEANLINESS, SECRET VENGEFULNESS IN THE ENTRAILS: A SINGLE WORD FROM ME DRIVES ALL HIS BAD INSTINCTS INTO A MAN‚ÄÔS FACE, MY ACQUAINTANCES INCLUDE SEVERAL GUINEA PIGS WHO ILLUSTRATE FOR ME DIFFERENT REACTIONS TO MY WRITINGS‚ÄÎDIFFERENT IN A VERY INSTRUCTIVE MANNER. THOSE WHO WANT NO PART OF THE CONTENTS, MY SO-CALLED FRIENDS, FOR EXAMPLE, BECOME ‚ÄÚIMPERSONAL‚ÄÙ: THEY CONGRATULATE ME FOR HAVING GOT ‚ÄÚTHAT FAR‚ÄÙ AGAIN‚ÄÎAND FIND SOME PROGRESS IN THE GREATER CHEERFULNESS OF THE TONE.

UTTERLY DEPRAVED ‚ÄÚSPIRITS,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚBEAUTIFUL SOULS,‚ÄÙ BEING MENDACIOUS THROUGH AND THROUGH, SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY ARE WITH THESE BOOKS‚ÄÎHENCE THEY CONSIDER THEM BENEATH THEMSELVES, THE BEAUTIFUL CONSISTENCY OF ALL ‚ÄÚBEAUTIFUL SOULS.‚ÄÙ THE OXEN AMONG MY ACQUAINTANCES‚ÄÎMERE GERMANS, IF I MAY SAY SO‚ÄÎSUGGEST THAT ONE CANNOT ALWAYS AGREE WITH MY OPINIONS, BUT AT TIMES‚ÄÎTHIS I HAVE BEEN TOLD EVEN ABOUT ZARATHUSTRA.

ALL ‚ÄÚFEMINISM,‚ÄÙ TOO‚ÄÎALSO IN MEN‚ÄÎCLOSES THE DOOR: IT WILL NEVER PERMIT ENTRANCE INTO THIS LABYRINTH OF AUDACIOUS INSIGHTS. ONE MUST NEVER HAVE SPARED ONESELF, ONE MUST HAVE ACQUIRED HARDNESS AS A HABIT TO BE CHEERFUL AND IN GOOD SPIRITS IN THE MIDST OF NOTHING BUT HARD TRUTHS. WHEN I IMAGINE A PERFECT READER, HE ALWAYS TURNS INTO A MONSTER OF COURAGE AND CURIOSITY; MOREOVER, SUPPLE, CUNNING, CAUTIOUS; A BORN ADVENTURER AND DISCOVERER. IN THE END, I COULD NOT SAY BETTER TO WHOM ALONE I AM SPEAKING AT BOTTOM THAN ZARATHUSTRA SAID IT: TO WHOM ALONE WILL HE RELATE HIS RIDDLE?

‚ÄÚTO YOU, THE BOLD SEARCHERS, RESEARCHERS, AND WHOEVER EMBARKS WITH CUNNING SAILS ON TERRIBLE SEAS‚ÄÎTO YOU, DRUNK WITH RIDDLES, GLAD OF THE TWILIGHT, WHOSE SOUL FLUTES LURE ASTRAY TO EVERY WHIRLPOOL, BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT TO GROPE ALONG A THREAD WITH COWARDLY HAND; AND WHERE YOU CAN GUESS, YOU HATE TO DEDUCE.‚ÄÙ1





4


THIS IS ALSO THE POINT FOR A GENERAL REMARK ABOUT MY ART OF STYLE. TO COMMUNICATE A STATE, AN INWARD TENSION OF PATHOS, BY MEANS OF SIGNS, INCLUDING THE TEMPO OF THESE SIGNS‚ÄÎTHAT IS THE MEANING OF EVERY STYLE;1 AND CONSIDERING THAT THE MULTIPLICITY OF INWARD STATES IS EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE IN MY CASE, I HAVE MANY STYLISTIC POSSIBILITIES‚ÄÎTHE MOST MULTIFARIOUS ART OF STYLE THAT HAS EVER BEEN AT THE DISPOSAL OF ONE MAN. GOOD IS ANY STYLE THAT REALLY COMMUNICATES AN INWARD STATE, THAT MAKES NO MISTAKE ABOUT THE SIGNS, THE TEMPO OF THE SIGNS, THE GESTURES‚ÄÎALL THE LAWS ABOUT LONG PERIODS ARE CONCERNED WITH THE ART OF GESTURES.2 HERE MY INSTINCT IS INFALLIBLE.

GOOD STYLE IN ITSELF‚ÄÎA PURE FOLLY, MERE ‚ÄÚIDEALISM,‚ÄÙ ON A LEVEL WITH THE ‚ÄÚBEAUTIFUL IN ITSELF,‚ÄÙ THE ‚ÄÚGOOD IN ITSELF,‚ÄÙ THE ‚ÄÚTHING IN ITSELF.‚ÄÙ

ALWAYS PRESUPPOSING THAT THERE ARE EARS‚ÄÎTHAT THERE ARE THOSE CAPABLE AND WORTHY OF THE SAME PATHOS, THAT THERE IS NO LACK OF THOSE TO WHOM ONE MAY COMMUNICATE ONESELF.‚ÄÎMY ZARATHUSTRA, FOR EXAMPLE, IS STILL LOOKING FOR THOSE‚ÄÎALAS, IT WILL HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING FOR A LONG TIME YET!‚ÄÎONE MUST BE WORTHY OF HEARING HIM.

AND UNTIL THEN THERE WILL BE NOBODY TO UNDERSTAND THE ART THAT HAS BEEN SQUANDERED HERE: NOBODY EVER WAS IN A POSITION TO SQUANDER MORE NEW, UNHEARD-OF ARTISTIC DEVICES THAT HAD ACTUALLY BEEN CREATED ONLY FOR THIS PURPOSE. THAT THIS WAS POSSIBLE IN GERMAN, OF ALL LANGUAGES, REMAINED TO BE SHOWN: I MYSELF WOULD HAVE REJECTED ANY SUCH NOTION MOST UNHESITATINGLY BEFORE. BEFORE ME, IT WAS NOT KNOWN WHAT COULD BE DONE WITH THE GERMAN LANGUAGE‚ÄÎWHAT COULD BE DONE WITH LANGUAGE IN GENERAL. THE ART OF THE GREAT RHYTHM, THE GREAT STYLE OF LONG PERIODS TO EXPRESS A TREMENDOUS UP AND DOWN OF SUBLIME, OF SUPERHUMAN PASSION, WAS DISCOVERED ONLY BY ME; WITH A DITHYRAMB LIKE THE LAST ONE IN THE THIRD PART OF ZARATHUSTRA, ENTITLED ‚ÄÚTHE SEVEN SEALS,‚ÄÙ I SOARED A THOUSAND MILES BEYOND WHAT WAS CALLED POETRY HITHERTO.





5


THAT A PSYCHOLOGIST WITHOUT EQUAL SPEAKS FROM MY WRITINGS, IS PERHAPS THE FIRST INSIGHT REACHED BY A GOOD READER‚ÄÎA READER AS I DESERVE HIM, WHO READS ME THE WAY GOOD OLD PHILOLOGISTS READ THEIR HORACE. THOSE PROPOSITIONS ON WHICH ALL THE WORLD IS REALLY AGREED‚ÄÎNOT TO SPEAK OF THE WORLD‚ÄÔS COMMON RUN OF PHILOSOPHERS, THE MORALISTS AND OTHER HOLLOW POTS, CABBAGE HEADS1‚ÄÎAPPEAR IN MY BOOKS AS NA√ØVE BLUNDERS: FOR EXAMPLE, THE BELIEF THAT ‚ÄÚUNEGOISTIC‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚEGOISTIC‚ÄÙ ARE OPPOSITES, WHILE THE EGO ITSELF IS REALLY ONLY A ‚ÄÚHIGHER SWINDLE,‚ÄÙ AN ‚ÄÚIDEAL.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHERE ARE NEITHER EGOISTIC NOR UNEGOISTIC ACTS: BOTH CONCEPTS ARE PSYCHOLOGICAL ABSURDITIES. OR THE PROPOSITION: ‚ÄÚMAN STRIVES FOR HAPPINESS.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎOR THE PROPOSITION: ‚ÄÚHAPPINESS IS THE REWARD OF VIRTUE.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎOR THE PROPOSITION: ‚ÄÚPLEASURE AND DISPLEASURE ARE OPPOSITES.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHE CIRCE OF HUMANITY, MORALITY, HAS FALSIFIED ALL PSYCHOLOGICA THROUGH AND THROUGH‚ÄÎMORALIZING THEM‚ÄÎDOWN TO THAT GRUESOME NONSENSE THAT LOVE IS SUPPOSED TO BE SOMETHING ‚ÄÚUNEGOISTIC.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎONE HAS TO SIT FIRMLY UPON ONESELF, ONE MUST STAND BRAVELY ON ONE‚ÄÔS OWN TWO LEGS, OTHERWISE ONE IS SIMPLY INCAPABLE OF LOVING. ULTIMATELY, WOMEN KNOW THAT ONLY TOO WELL: THEY DON‚ÄÔT GIVE A DAMN ABOUT SELFLESS, MERELY OBJECTIVE MEN.

MAY I HERE VENTURE THE SURMISE THAT I KNOW WOMEN? THAT IS PART OF MY DIONYSIAN DOWRY. WHO KNOWS? PERHAPS I AM THE FIRST PSYCHOLOGIST OF THE ETERNALLY FEMININE. THEY ALL LOVE ME‚ÄÎAN OLD STORY‚ÄÎNOT COUNTING ABORTIVE FEMALES, THE ‚ÄÚEMANCIPATED‚ÄÙ WHO LACK THE STUFF FOR CHILDREN.‚ÄÎFORTUNATELY, I AM NOT WILLING TO BE TORN TO PIECES: THE PERFECT WOMAN TEARS TO PIECES WHEN SHE LOVES.‚ÄÎI KNOW THESE CHARMING MAENADS.‚ÄÎAH, WHAT A DANGEROUS, CREEPING, SUBTERRANEAN LITTLE BEAST OF PREY SHE IS! AND YET SO AGREEABLE!‚ÄÎA LITTLE WOMAN WHO PURSUES HER REVENGE WOULD RUN OVER FATE ITSELF.‚ÄÎWOMAN IS INDESCRIBABLY MORE EVIL THAN MAN; ALSO CLEVERER: GOOD NATURE IS IN A WOMAN A FORM OF DEGENERATION.‚ÄÎIN ALL SO-CALLED ‚ÄÚBEAUTIFUL SOULS‚ÄÙ SOMETHING IS PHYSIOLOGICALLY ASKEW AT BOTTOM; I DO NOT SAY EVERYTHING, ELSE I SHOULD BECOME MEDI-CYNICAL. THE FIGHT FOR EQUAL RIGHTS IS ACTUALLY A SYMPTOM OF A DISEASE: EVERY PHYSICIAN KNOWS THAT.‚ÄÎWOMAN, THE MORE SHE IS A WOMAN, RESISTS RIGHTS IN GENERAL HAND AND FOOT: AFTER ALL, THE STATE OF NATURE, THE ETERNAL WAR BETWEEN THE SEXES, GIVES HER BY FAR THE FIRST RANK.

HAS MY DEFINITION OF LOVE BEEN HEARD? IT IS THE ONLY ONE WORTHY OF A PHILOSOPHER. LOVE‚ÄÎIN ITS MEANS, WAR; AT BOTTOM, THE DEADLY HATRED OF THE SEXES.

HAS MY ANSWER BEEN HEARD TO THE QUESTION HOW ONE CURES A WOMAN‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚREDEEMS‚ÄÙ HER? ONE GIVES HER A CHILD. WOMAN NEEDS CHILDREN, A MAN IS FOR HER ALWAYS ONLY A MEANS: THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA.

‚ÄÚEMANCIPATION OF WOMEN‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT IS THE INSTINCTIVE HATRED OF THE ABORTIVE2 WOMAN, WHO IS INCAPABLE OF GIVING BIRTH, AGAINST THE WOMAN WHO IS TURNED OUT WELL3‚ÄÎTHE FIGHT AGAINST THE ‚ÄÚMAN‚ÄÙ IS ALWAYS A MERE MEANS, PRETEXT, TACTIC. BY RAISING THEMSELVES HIGHER, AS ‚ÄÚWOMAN IN HERSELF,‚ÄÙ AS THE ‚ÄÚHIGHER WOMAN,‚ÄÙ AS A FEMALE ‚ÄÚIDEALIST,‚ÄÙ THEY WANT TO LOWER THE LEVEL OF THE GENERAL RANK OF WOMAN; AND THERE IS NO SURER MEANS FOR THAT THAN HIGHER EDUCATION, SLACKS, AND POLITICAL VOTING-CATTLE RIGHTS. AT BOTTOM, THE EMANCIPATED ARE ANARCHISTS IN THE WORLD OF THE ‚ÄÚETERNALLY FEMININE,‚ÄÙ THE UNDERPRIVILEGED WHOSE MOST FUNDAMENTAL INSTINCT IS REVENGE.

ONE WHOLE SPECIES OF THE MOST MALIGNANT ‚ÄÚIDEALISM‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWHICH, INCIDENTALLY, IS ALSO ENCOUNTERED AMONG MEN; FOR EXAMPLE, IN HENRIK IBSEN, THIS TYPICAL OLD VIRGIN‚ÄÎAIMS TO POISON THE GOOD CONSCIENCE, WHAT IS NATURAL IN SEXUAL LOVE.4

AND LEST I LEAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT MY VERY DECENT AND STRICT VIEWS IN THESE MATTERS, LET ME STILL CITE A PROPOSITION AGAINST VICE FROM MY MORAL CODE: I USE THE WORD ‚ÄÚVICE‚ÄÙ IN MY FIGHT AGAINST EVERY KIND OF ANTINATURE OR, IF YOU PREFER PRETTY WORDS, IDEALISM. THE PROPOSITION READS: ‚ÄÚTHE PREACHING OF CHASTITY AMOUNTS TO A PUBLIC INCITEMENT TO ANTINATURE. EVERY KIND OF CONTEMPT FOR SEX, EVERY IMPURIFICATION OF IT BY MEANS OF THE CONCEPT ‚ÄÒIMPURE,‚ÄÔ IS THE CRIME PAR EXCELLENCE AGAINST LIFE‚ÄÎIS THE REAL SIN AGAINST THE HOLY SPIRIT OF LIFE.‚ÄÙ





6


TO GIVE AN IDEA OF ME AS A PSYCHOLOGIST, I CHOOSE A CURIOUS BIT OF PSYCHOLOGY FROM BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL; INCIDENTALLY, I FORBID ANY SURMISE ABOUT WHOM I AM DESCRIBING IN THIS PASSAGE:1

THE GENIUS OF THE HEART, AS THAT GREAT CONCEALED ONE POSSESSES IT, THE TEMPTER GOD AND BORN PIED PIPER OF CONSCIENCES WHOSE VOICE KNOWS HOW TO DESCEND INTO THE NETHERWORLD OF EVERY SOUL; WHO DOES NOT SAY A WORD OR CAST A GLANCE IN WHICH THERE IS NO CONSIDERATION AND ULTERIOR ENTICEMENT; WHOSE MASTERY INCLUDES THE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO SEEM‚ÄÎNOT WHAT HE IS BUT WHAT IS TO THOSE WHO FOLLOW HIM ONE MORE CONSTRAINT TO PRESS EVER CLOSER TO HIM IN ORDER TO FOLLOW HIM EVEN MORE INWARDLY AND THOROUGHLY‚ÄÎTHE GENIUS OF THE HEART WHO SILENCES ALL THAT IS LOUD AND SELF-SATISFIED, TEACHING IT TO LISTEN; WHO SMOOTHS ROUGH SOULS AND LETS THEM TASTE A NEW DESIRE‚ÄÎTO LIE STILL AS A MIRROR, THAT THE DEEP SKY MAY MIRROR ITSELF IN THEM‚ÄÎTHE GENIUS OF THE HEART WHO TEACHES THE DOLTISH AND RASH HAND TO HESITATE AND REACH OUT MORE DELICATELY; WHO GUESSES THE CONCEALED AND FORGOTTEN TREASURE, THE DROP OF GRACIOUSNESS AND SWEET SPIRITUALITY UNDER DIM AND THICK ICE, AND IS A DIVINING ROD FOR EVERY GRAIN OF GOLD THAT HAS LONG LAIN BURIED IN THE DUNGEON OF MUCH MUD AND SAND; THE GENIUS OF THE HEART FROM WHOSE TOUCH EVERYONE WALKS AWAY RICHER, NOT HAVING RECEIVED GRACE AND SURPRISED, NOT AS BLESSED AND OPPRESSED BY ALIEN GOODS, BUT RICHER IN HIMSELF, NEWER TO HIMSELF THAN BEFORE, BROKEN OPEN, BLOWN AT AND SOUNDED OUT BY A THAWING WIND, PERHAPS MORE UNSURE, TENDERER, MORE FRAGILE, MORE BROKEN, BUT FULL OF HOPES THAT AS YET HAVE NO NAME, FULL OF NEW WILL AND CURRENTS, FULL OF NEW DISSATISFACTION AND UNDERTOWS ‚Ä¶

NIETZSCHE WAS SO PLEASED WITH SPITTELER‚ÄÔS REACTION TO THE CASE OF WAGNER THAT HE ASKED HIM TO PUBLISH, WITH A PREFACE, THE PASSAGES FROM NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS EARLIER BOOKS THAT NIETZSCHE THEN DECIDED‚ÄÎEVEN BEFORE SPITTELER HAD HAD TIME TO DECLINE‚ÄÎTO PUBLISH HIMSELF: NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER. IN 1908 SPITTELER PUBLISHED A SMALL FIFTY-PAGE PAMPHLET, MEINE BEZIEHUNGEN ZU NIETZSCHE (MY RELATIONS‚ÄÎOR CONTACTS‚ÄÎWITH NIETZSCHE; MUNICH, S√ºDDEUTSCHE MONATSHEFTE).

THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY





1


TO BE FAIR TO THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY (1872), ONE HAS TO FORGET A FEW THINGS. ITS EFFECT AND FASCINATION WERE DUE TO WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT‚ÄÎITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION TO WAGNERISM, AS IF THAT WERE A SYMPTOM OF ASCENT. IN THIS RESPECT, THIS ESSAY WAS AN EVENT IN THE LIFE OF WAGNER: IT WAS ONLY FROM THAT MOMENT ON THAT WAGNER‚ÄÔS NAME ELICITED HIGH HOPES. PEOPLE STILL REMIND ME OF THIS TODAY, SOMETIMES EVEN IN THE CONTEXT OF PARSIFAL‚ÄÎHOW I AM THE ONE WHO HAS IT ON HIS CONSCIENCE THAT SUCH A HIGH OPINION OF THE CULTURAL VALUE OF THIS MOVEMENT GAINED PREVALENCE.

SEVERAL TIMES I SAW THIS BOOK CITED AS ‚ÄÚTHE RE-BIRTH OF TRAGEDY OUT OF THE SPIRIT OF MUSIC‚ÄÙ: WHAT PEOPLE HAD EARS FOR WAS ONLY A NEW FORMULA FOR THE ART, THE INTENTIONS, THE TASK OF WAGNER‚ÄÎAND WHAT WAS REALLY VALUABLE IN THE ESSAY WAS IGNORED. ‚ÄÚHELLENISM AND PESSIMISM‚ÄÙ WOULD HAVE BEEN A LESS AMBIGUOUS TITLE‚ÄÎSUGGESTING THE FIRST INSTRUCTION ABOUT HOW THE GREEKS GOT OVER THEIR PESSIMISM, HOW THEY OVERCAME IT.

PRECISELY THEIR TRAGEDIES PROVE THAT THE GREEKS WERE NOT PESSIMISTS: SCHOPENHAUER WENT WRONG AT THIS POINT, AS HE WENT WRONG EVERYWHERE.

TAKEN UP WITH SOME DEGREE OF NEUTRALITY, THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY LOOKS QUITE UNTIMELY: ONE WOULD NEVER DREAM THAT IT WAS BEGUN AMID THE THUNDER OF THE BATTLE OF WORTH. BEFORE THE WALLS OF METZ, IN COLD SEPTEMBER NIGHTS, WHILE ON DUTY AS A MEDICAL ORDERLY, I THOUGHT THROUGH THESE PROBLEMS. ONE MIGHT SOONER BELIEVE THAT THE ESSAY WAS FIFTY YEARS OLDER.1 IT IS INDIFFERENT TOWARD POLITICS‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚUN-GERMAN,‚ÄÙ TO USE THE LANGUAGE OF THE PRESENT TIME‚ÄÎIT SMELLS OFFENSIVELY HEGELIAN, AND THE CADAVEROUS PERFUME OF SCHOPENHAUER STICKS ONLY TO A FEW FORMULAS. AN ‚ÄÚIDEA‚ÄÙ2‚ÄÎTHE ANTITHESIS3 OF THE DIONYSIAN AND THE APOLLINIAN‚ÄÎTRANSLATED INTO THE REALM OF METAPHYSICS; HISTORY ITSELF AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS ‚ÄÚIDEA;‚ÄÙ IN TRAGEDY THIS ANTITHESIS IS SUBLIMATED4 INTO A UNITY; AND IN THIS PERSPECTIVE THINGS THAT HAD NEVER BEFORE FACED EACH OTHER ARE SUDDENLY JUXTAPOSED, USED TO ILLUMINATE EACH OTHER, AND COMPREHENDED5‚ÄÎOPERA, FOR EXAMPLE, AND THE REVOLUTION.

THE TWO DECISIVE INNOVATIONS OF THE BOOK ARE, FIRST, ITS UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIONYSIAN PHENOMENON AMONG THE GREEKS: FOR THE FIRST TIME, A PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THIS PHENOMENON IS OFFERED, AND IT IS CONSIDERED AS ONE ROOT OF THE WHOLE OF GREEK ART. SECONDLY, THERE IS THE UNDERSTANDING OF SOCRATISM: SOCRATES IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE FIRST TIME AS AN INSTRUMENT OF GREEK DISINTEGRATION, AS A TYPICAL DECADENT. ‚ÄÚRATIONALITY‚ÄÙ AGAINST INSTINCT. ‚ÄÚRATIONALITY‚ÄÙ AT ANY PRICE AS A DANGEROUS FORCE THAT UNDERMINES LIFE.6

PROFOUND, HOSTILE SILENCE ABOUT CHRISTIANITY THROUGHOUT THE BOOK. THAT IS NEITHER APOLLINIAN NOR DIONYSIAN; IT NEGATES ALL AESTHETIC VALUES‚ÄÎTHE ONLY VALUES RECOGNIZED IN THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY: IT IS NIHILISTIC IN THE MOST PROFOUND SENSE, WHILE IN THE DIONYSIAN SYMBOL THE ULTIMATE LIMIT OF AFFIRMATION IS ATTAINED. THERE IS ONE ALLUSION TO CHRISTIAN PRIESTS AS A ‚ÄÚVICIOUS KIND OF DWARFS‚ÄÙ WHO ARE ‚ÄÚSUBTERRANEAN.‚ÄÙ7

THIS BEGINNING IS EXCEEDINGLY STRANGE. I HAD DISCOVERED THE ONLY PARABLE AND PARALLEL IN HISTORY FOR MY OWN INMOST EXPERIENCE ‚ÄÎAND THUS BECAME THE FIRST TO COMPREHEND THE WONDERFUL PHENOMENON OF THE DIONYSIAN. AT THE SAME TIME MY DISCOVERY THAT SOCRATES WAS A DECADENT PROVED UNEQUIVOCALLY HOW LITTLE THE SURENESS OF MY PSYCHOLOGICAL GRASP WOULD BE ENDANGERED BY ANY MORAL IDIOSYNCRASY: SEEING MORALITY ITSELF AS A SYMPTOM OF DECADENCE IS AN INNOVATION AND A SINGULARITY OF THE FIRST RANK IN THE HISTORY OF KNOWLEDGE. HOW HIGH HAD I JUMPED WITH THESE TWO INSIGHTS ABOVE THE WRETCHED AND SHALLOW CHATTER ABOUT OPTIMISM VERSUS PESSIMISM!

I WAS THE FIRST TO SEE1 THE REAL OPPOSITION: THE DEGENERATING INSTINCT THAT TURNS AGAINST LIFE WITH SUBTERRANEAN VENGEFULNESS (CHRISTIANITY, THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCHOPENHAUER, IN A CERTAIN SENSE ALREADY THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLATO, AND ALL OF IDEALISM AS TYPICAL FORMS) VERSUS A FORMULA FOR THE HIGHEST AFFIRMATION, BORN OF FULLNESS, OF OVERFULL-NESS, A YES-SAYING WITHOUT RESERVATION, EVEN TO SUFFERING, EVEN TO GUILT, EVEN TO EVERYTHING THAT IS QUESTIONABLE AND STRANGE IN EXISTENCE.

THIS ULTIMATE, MOST JOYOUS, MOST WANTONLY EXTRAVAGANT YES TO LIFE REPRESENTS NOT ONLY THE HIGHEST INSIGHT BUT ALSO THE DEEPEST, THAT WHICH IS MOST STRICTLY CONFIRMED AND BORN OUT BY TRUTH AND SCIENCE. NOTHING IN EXISTENCE MAY BE SUBTRACTED, NOTHING IS DISPENSABLE‚ÄÎTHOSE ASPECTS OF EXISTENCE WHICH CHRISTIANS AND OTHER NIHILISTS REPUDIATE ARE ACTUALLY ON AN INFINITELY HIGHER LEVEL IN THE ORDER OF RANK AMONG VALUES THAN THAT WHICH THE INSTINCT OF DECADENCE COULD APPROVE AND CALL GOOD.2 TO COMPREHEND THIS REQUIRES COURAGE AND, AS A CONDITION OF THAT, AN EXCESS OF STRENGTH: FOR PRECISELY AS FAR AS COURAGE MAY VENTURE FORWARD, PRECISELY ACCORDING TO THAT MEASURE OF STRENGTH ONE APPROACHES THE TRUTH. KNOWLEDGE, SAYING YES TO REALITY, IS JUST AS NECESSARY FOR THE STRONG AS COWARDICE AND THE FLIGHT FROM REALITY‚ÄÎAS THE ‚ÄÚIDEAL‚ÄÙ IS FOR THE WEAK, WHO ARE INSPIRED BY WEAKNESS.

THEY ARE NOT FREE TO KNOW: THE DECADENTS NEED THE LIE‚ÄÎIT IS ONE OF THE CONDITIONS OF THEIR PRESERVATION.

WHOEVER DOES NOT MERELY COMPREHEND THE WORD ‚ÄÚDIONYSIAN‚ÄÙ BUT COMPREHENDS HIMSELF IN THE WORD ‚ÄÚDIONYSIAN‚ÄÙ NEEDS NO REFUTATION OF PLATO OR CHRISTIANITY OR SCHOPENHAUER‚ÄÎHE SMELLS THE DECAY.

HOW I HAD THUS FOUND THE CONCEPT OF THE ‚ÄÚTRAGIC‚ÄÙ AND AT LONG LAST KNOWLEDGE OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRAGEDY, I HAVE EXPLAINED MOST RECENTLY IN TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS:1

‚ÄÚSAYING YES TO LIFE EVEN IN ITS STRANGEST AND HARDEST PROBLEMS; THE WILL TO LIFE REJOICING OVER ITS OWN INEXHAUSTIBILITY EVEN IN THE VERY SACRIFICE OF ITS HIGHEST TYPES‚ÄÎTHAT IS WHAT I CALLED DIONYSIAN, THAT IS WHAT I UNDERSTOOD AS2 THE BRIDGE TO THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE TRAGIC POET. NOT IN ORDER TO GET RID OF TERROR AND PITY, NOT IN ORDER TO PURGE ONESELF OF A DANGEROUS AFFECT BY ITS VEHEMENT DISCHARGE‚ÄÎARISTOTLE MISUNDERSTOOD3 IT THAT WAY‚ÄÎBUT IN ORDER TO BE ONESELF THE ETERNAL JOY OF BECOMING, BEYOND ALL TERROR AND PITY‚ÄÎTHAT JOY WHICH INCLUDES EVEN JOY IN DESTROYING.‚ÄÙ

IN THIS SENSE I HAVE THE RIGHT TO UNDERSTAND MYSELF AS THE FIRST TRAGIC PHILOSOPHER‚ÄÎTHAT IS, THE MOST EXTREME OPPOSITE AND ANTIPODE OF A PESSIMISTIC PHILOSOPHER. BEFORE ME THIS TRANSPOSITION OF THE DIONYSIAN INTO A PHILOSOPHICAL PATHOS DID NOT EXIST: TRAGIC WISDOM WAS LACKING; I HAVE LOOKED IN VAIN FOR SIGNS OF IT EVEN AMONG THE GREAT GREEKS IN PHILOSOPHY, THOSE OF THE TWO CENTURIES BEFORE SOCRATES.4 I RETAINED SOME DOUBT IN THE CASE OF HERACLITUS, IN WHOSE PROXIMITY I FEEL ALTOGETHER WARMER AND BETTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE. THE AFFIRMATION OF PASSING AWAY AND DESTROYING, WHICH IS THE DECISIVE FEATURE OF A DIONYSIAN PHILOSOPHY; SAYING YES TO OPPOSITION AND WAR; BECOMING, ALONG WITH A RADICAL REPUDIATION OF THE VERY CONCEPT OF BEING‚ÄÎALL THIS IS CLEARLY MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO ME THAN ANYTHING ELSE THOUGHT TO DATE. THE DOCTRINE OF THE ‚ÄÚETERNAL RECURRENCE,‚ÄÙ THAT IS, OF THE UNCONDITIONAL AND INFINITELY REPEATED CIRCULAR COURSE OF ALL THINGS‚ÄÎTHIS DOCTRINE OF ZARATHUSTRA MIGHT IN THE END HAVE BEEN TAUGHT ALREADY BY HERACLITUS. AT LEAST THE STOA HAS TRACES OF IT, AND THE STOICS INHERITED ALMOST ALL OF THEIR PRINCIPAL NOTIONS FROM HERACLITUS.

A TREMENDOUS HOPE SPEAKS OUT OF THIS ESSAY. IN THE END I LACK ALL REASON TO RENOUNCE THE HOPE FOR A DIONYSIAN FUTURE OF MUSIC. LET US LOOK AHEAD A CENTURY; LET US SUPPOSE THAT MY ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE TWO MILLENNIA OF ANTINATURE AND DESECRATION OF MAN WERE TO SUCCEED. THAT NEW PARTY OF LIFE WHICH WOULD TACKLE THE GREATEST OF ALL TASKS, THE ATTEMPT TO RAISE HUMANITY HIGHER, INCLUDING THE RELENTLESS DESTRUCTION OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS DEGENERATING AND PARASITICAL, WOULD AGAIN MAKE POSSIBLE THAT EXCESS OF LIFE ON EARTH FROM WHICH THE DIONYSIAN STATE, TOO, WOULD HAVE TO AWAKEN AGAIN. I PROMISE A TRAGIC AGE: THE HIGHEST ART IN SAYING YES TO LIFE, TRAGEDY, WILL BE REBORN WHEN HUMANITY HAS WEATHERED THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE HARDEST BUT MOST NECESSARY WARS WITHOUT SUFFERING FROM IT.

A PSYCHOLOGIST MIGHT STILL ADD THAT WHAT I HEARD AS A YOUNG MAN LISTENING TO WAGNERIAN MUSIC REALLY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WAGNER; THAT WHEN I DESCRIBED DIONYSIAN MUSIC I DESCRIBED WHAT I HAD HEARD‚ÄÎTHAT INSTINCTIVELY I HAD TO TRANSPOSE AND TRANSFIGURE EVERYTHING INTO THE NEW SPIRIT THAT I CARRIED IN ME. THE PROOF OF THAT, AS STRONG AS ANY PROOF CAN BE, IS MY ESSAY ON WAGNER IN BAYREUTH: IN ALL PSYCHOLOGICALLY DECISIVE PLACES I ALONE AM DISCUSSED‚ÄÎAND ONE NEED NOT HESITATE TO PUT DOWN MY NAME OR THE WORD ‚ÄÚZARATHUSTRA‚ÄÙ WHERE THE TEXT HAS THE WORD ‚ÄÚWAGNER.‚ÄÙ THE ENTIRE PICTURE OF THE DITHYRAMBIC ARTIST IS A PICTURE OF THE PRE-EXISTENT POET OF ZARATHUSTRA, SKETCHED WITH ABYSMAL PROFUNDITY AND WITHOUT TOUCHING EVEN FOR A MOMENT THE WAGNERIAN REALITY. WAGNER HIMSELF HAD SOME NOTION OF THAT; HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIMSELF IN THIS ESSAY.

SIMILARLY, ‚ÄÚTHE IDEA OF BAYREUTH‚ÄÙ WAS TRANSFORMED INTO SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NOT PUZZLE THOSE WHO KNOW MY ZARATHUSTRA: INTO THAT GREAT NOON AT WHICH THE MOST ELECT CONSECRATE THEMSELVES FOR THE GREATEST OF ALL TASKS. WHO COULD SAY? THE VISION OF A FEAST THAT I SHALL YET LIVE TO SEE.

THE PATHOS OF THE FIRST PAGES IS WORLD-HISTORICAL; THE GLANCE SPOKEN OF ON THE SEVENTH PAGE IS ZARATHUSTRA‚ÄÔS DISTINCTIVE GLANCE; WAGNER, BAYREUTH, THE WHOLE WRETCHED GERMAN PETTINESS ARE A CLOUD IN WHICH AN INFINITE MIRAGE OF THE FUTURE IS REFLECTED. EVEN PSYCHOLOGICALLY ALL DECISIVE TRAITS OF MY OWN NATURE ARE PROJECTED INTO WAGNER‚ÄÔS‚ÄÎTHE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE BRIGHTEST AND THE MOST CALAMITOUS FORCES, THE WILL TO POWER AS NO MAN EVER POSSESSED IT,5 THE RUTHLESS COURAGE IN MATTERS OF THE SPIRIT, THE UNLIMITED POWER TO LEARN WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE WILL TO ACT. EVERYTHING IN THIS ESSAY POINTS TO THE FUTURE: THE IMPENDING RETURN OF THE GREEK SPIRIT, THE NECESSITY OF COUNTER-ALEXANDERS WHO WILL RETIE THE GORDIAN KNOT OF GREEK CULTURE.

LISTEN TO THE WORLD-HISTORICAL ACCENT WITH WHICH THE CONCEPT OF THE TRAGIC ATTITUDE IS INTRODUCED AT THE END OF SECTION 4: THIS ESSAY IS FULL OF WORLD-HISTORICAL ACCENTS. THIS IS THE STRANGEST ‚ÄÚOBJECTIVITY‚ÄÙ POSSIBLE: THE ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT I AM WAS PROJECTED ON SOME ACCIDENTAL REALITY‚ÄÎTHE TRUTH ABOUT ME SPOKE FROM SOME GRUESOME DEPTH. AT THE BEGINNING OF SECTION 9 THE STYLE OF ZARATHUSTRA IS DESCRIBED WITH INCISIVE CERTAINTY AND ANTICIPATED; AND NO MORE MAGNIFICENT EXPRESSION COULD BE FOUND FOR THE EVENT OF ZARATHUSTRA, THE ACT OF A TREMENDOUS PURIFICATION AND CONSECRATION OF HUMANITY, THAN WAS FOUND IN SECTION 6.6

THE UNTIMELY ONES1





1


THE FOUR UNTIMELY ONES ARE CERTAINLY WARLIKE. THEY PROVE THAT I WAS NO JACK THE DREAMER, THAT I TAKE PLEASURE IN FENCING‚ÄÎPERHAPS ALSO THAT I AM DANGEROUSLY QUICK AT THE DRAW. THE FIRST ATTACK (1873) WAS DIRECTED AGAINST GERMAN ‚ÄÚCULTURE‚ÄÙ2 ON WHICH I LOOKED DOWN EVEN THEN WITH RUTHLESS CONTEMPT. WITHOUT MEANING, WITHOUT SUBSTANCE, WITHOUT AIM: MERE ‚ÄÚPUBLIC OPINION.‚ÄÙ THERE IS NO MORE MALIGNANT MISUNDERSTANDING THAN TO BELIEVE THAT THE GREAT MILITARY SUCCESS3 OF THE GERMANS PROVED ANYTHING IN FAVOR OF THIS ‚ÄÚCULTURE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎOR, OF ALL THINGS, ITS TRIUMPH OVER FRANCE.

THE SECOND UNTIMELY ONE (1874) BRINGS TO LIGHT WHAT IS DANGEROUS AND GNAWS AT AND POISONS LIFE IN OUR KIND OF TRAFFIC WITH SCIENCE AND SCHOLARSHIP4‚ÄÎHOW LIFE IS MADE SICK BY THIS DEHUMANIZED AND MECHANICAL GRINDING OF GEARS, THE ‚ÄÚIMPERSONALITY‚ÄÙ OF THE LABORER, THE FALSE ECONOMY OF THE ‚ÄÚDIVISION OF LABOR.‚ÄÙ THE AIM IS LOST, GENUINE CULTURE‚ÄÎAND THE MEANS, THE MODERN TRAFFIC WITH SCIENCE, BARBARIZED. IN THIS ESSAY THE ‚ÄÚHISTORICAL SENSE‚ÄÙ OF WHICH THIS CENTURY IS PROUD WAS RECOGNIZED FOR THE FIRST TIME AS A DISEASE, AS A TYPICAL SYMPTOM OF DECAY.

IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH UNTIMELY ONES, TWO IMAGES OF THE HARDEST SELF-LOVE, SELF-DISCIPLINE5 ARE PUT UP AGAINST ALL THIS, AS POINTERS TO A HIGHER CONCEPT OF CULTURE, TO RESTORE THE CONCEPT OF CULTURE‚ÄÎUNTIMELY TYPES PAR EXCELLENCE, FULL OF SOVEREIGN CONTEMPT FOR EVERYTHING AROUND THEM THAT WAS CALLED ‚ÄÚEMPIRE,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚCULTURE,‚ÄÙ6‚ÄÚCHRISTIANITY,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚBISMARCK,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚSUCCESS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎSCHOPENHAUER AND WAGNER OR, IN ONE WORD, NIETZSCHE.

OF THESE FOUR ATTEMPTS AT ASSASSINATION THE FIRST HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS. THE NOISE IT EVOKED WAS IN EVERY SENSE SPLENDID. I HAD TOUCHED THE SORE SPOT OF A VICTORIOUS NATION‚ÄÎTHAT ITS VICTORY WAS NOT A CULTURAL EVENT BUT PERHAPS, PERHAPS SOMETHING ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT.

THE RESPONSE CAME FROM ALL SIDES AND BY NO MEANS ONLY FROM THE OLD FRIENDS OF DAVID STRAUSS WHOM I HAD MADE RIDICULOUS AS A TYPE OF THE GERMAN ‚ÄÚCULTURAL‚ÄÙ PHILISTINE AND SATISFAIT,1 IN SHORT AS THE AUTHOR OF HIS BEER-HALL GOSPEL OF THE OLD AND THE NEW FAITH (THE WORD BILDUNGSPHILISTER HAS SURVIVED IN THE GERMAN LANGUAGE FROM MY ESSAY).2 THESE OLD FRIENDS, W√ºRTTEMBERGERS AND SWABIANS WHOM I HAD WOUNDED DEEPLY WHEN I FOUND THEIR PRODIGY, STRAUSS, FUNNY, REPLIED IN SUCH A FOURSQUARE AND RUDE MANNER THAT I COULD NOT HAVE ASKED FOR MORE; THE REPLIES FROM PRUSSIA WERE MORE PRUDENT‚ÄÎTHEY HAD MORE PRUSSIAN, BERLIN BLUE IN THEM. IT WAS A NEWSPAPER IN LEIPZIG, THE NOTORIOUS GRENZBOTEN, THAT BECAME MOST INDECENT; I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO RESTRAIN THE INDIGNANT BASELERS FROM TAKING ACTION. THE ONLY ONES WHO DECIDED UNCONDITIONALLY IN MY FAVOR WERE A FEW OLD GENTLEMEN, FROM MIXED AND IN PART UNDISCOVERABLE MOTIVES. EWALD IN G√∂TTINGEN WAS AMONG THEM;3 HE SUGGESTED MY ATTEMPT HAD BEEN FATAL FOR STRAUSS. ALSO THE OLD HEGELIAN, BRUNO BAUER,4 WHO WAS HENCEFORTH ONE OF MY MOST ATTENTIVE READERS. DURING HIS LAST YEARS HE LIKED TO REFER TO ME; FOR EXAMPLE, BY GIVING HERR VON TREITSCHKE, THE PRUSSIAN HISTORIOGRAPHER, A HINT WHOM HE MIGHT ASK FOR SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF CULTURE WHICH HAD ESCAPED HIM. NOTHING WRITTEN ABOUT THIS ESSAY AND ITS AUTHOR WAS MORE THOUGHT-PROVOKING OR LONGER THAN WHAT AN OLD DISCIPLE OF THE PHILOSOPHER VON BAADER5 SAID, A PROFESSOR HOFFMANN IN W√ºRZBURG.6 ON THE BASIS OF THIS ESSAY HE PREDICTED A GREAT DESTINY FOR ME‚ÄÎBRINGING ABOUT A KIND OF CRISIS AND ULTIMATE DECISION IN THE PROBLEM OF ATHEISM WHOSE MOST INSTINCTIVE AND RELENTLESS TYPE HE DIVINED IN ME. IT WAS ATHEISM THAT LED ME TO SCHOPENHAUER.

NOTHING WAS HEARD AS WELL OR EXPERIENCED AS BITTERLY AS AN EXTRAORDINARILY STRONG AND COURAGEOUS PLEA BY THE USUALLY MILD KARL HILLEBRAND, THIS LAST HUMANE GERMAN WHO KNEW HOW TO WRITE. HIS PIECE WAS READ IN THE AUGSBURGER ZEITUNG; TODAY IT CAN BE READ, IN A SOMEWHAT MORE CAUTIOUS FORM, IN HIS COLLECTED ESSAYS.7 HERE THE ESSAY WAS CONSIDERED AS AN EVENT, A TURNING POINT, A FIRST SELF-EXAMINATION, THE VERY BEST SIGN, AS A REAL RETURN OF GERMAN SERIOUSNESS AND GERMAN PASSION IN MATTERS OF THE SPIRIT. HILLEBRAND WAS FULL OF HIGH PRAISE FOR THE FORM OF THE ESSAY, FOR ITS MATURE TASTE, FOR ITS PERFECT TACT IN DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THE PERSON AND THE ISSUE: HE DESIGNATED IT AS THE BEST POLEMICAL ESSAY WRITTEN IN GERMAN‚ÄÎIN THE ART OF POLEMICS WHICH IS SO DANGEROUS AND INADVISABLE FOR GERMANS. SAYING YES UNCONDITIONALLY, EVEN SHARPENING THE POINTS I HAD DARED TO MAKE AGAINST THE GALLOPING SLOVENLINESS OF THE GERMAN LANGUAGE8 (TODAY THEY PLAY THE PURISTS AND CAN NO LONGER FORM A SENTENCE), WITH EQUAL CONTEMPT FOR THE ‚ÄÚFOREMOST WRITERS‚ÄÙ OF THIS NATION, HE CONCLUDED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF HIS ADMIRATION FOR MY COURAGE‚ÄÎTHAT ‚ÄÚSUPREME COURAGE WHICH PREFERS CHARGES PRECISELY AGAINST THE FAVORITES OF A PEOPLE.‚ÄÙ

THE AFTEREFFECTS OF THIS ESSAY UPON MY LIFE ARE VIRTUALLY INESTIMABLE. NOBODY SO FAR HAS PICKED QUARRELS WITH ME; IN GERMANY I AM TREATED WITH GLOOMY CAUTION: FOR YEARS I HAVE MADE USE OF AN UNCONDITIONAL FREEDOM OF SPEECH FOR WHICH NOBODY TODAY, LEAST OF ALL IN THE REICH, HAS SUFFICIENT LIBERTY. MY PARADISE LIES ‚ÄÚIN THE SHADOW OF MY SWORD.‚ÄÙ

AT BOTTOM, I HAD PUT INTO PRACTISE ONE OF STENDHAL‚ÄÔS MAXIMS: HE ADVISES MEN TO MAKE THEIR ENTRY INTO SOCIETY WITH A DUEL. AND HOW I HAD PICKED MY OPPONENT! THE FOREMOST GERMAN FREE SPIRIT!

INDEED, AN ALTOGETHER NEW TYPE OF FREE SPIRIT THUS GAINED HIS FIRST EXPRESSION: TO THIS DAY NOTHING IS MORE FOREIGN AND LESS RELATED TO ME THAN THE WHOLE EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN SPECIES OF LIBRES PENSEURS9 I AM MUCH MORE PROFOUNDLY AT ODDS WITH THEM, AS INCORRIGIBLE BLOCKHEADS AND BUFFOONS OF ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS,‚ÄÙ THAN WITH ANY OF THEIR OPPONENTS. THEY ALSO WANT IN THEIR OWN WAY TO ‚ÄÚIMPROVE‚ÄÙ MANKIND, IN THEIR OWN IMAGE; AGAINST WHAT I AM, WHAT I WANT, THEY WOULD WAGE AN IRRECONCILABLE WAR IF THEY UNDERSTOOD ME: ALL OF THEM STILL BELIEVE IN THE ‚ÄÚIDEAL.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎI AM THE FIRST IMMORALIST.





3


THAT THE TWO UNTIMELY ONES DISTINGUISHED BY THE NAMES OF SCHOPENHAUER AND WAGNER CONTRIBUTE MUCH TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF, OR EVEN TO THE FORMULATION OF THE PROPER PSYCHOLOGICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT, THESE TWO CASES, I SHOULD NOT WISH TO ASSERT‚ÄÎEXCEPTING, AS SEEMS FAIR, SOME DETAILS. THUS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE ELEMENTARY FACT IN WAGNER‚ÄÔS CHARACTER IS ALREADY DESIGNATED WITH A PROFOUND SURENESS OF INSTINCT AS AN ACTOR‚ÄÔS TALENT THAT MERELY EXPLICATES ITSELF IN HIS MEANS AND INTENTIONS.

WHAT I WAS FUNDAMENTALLY TRYING TO DO IN THESE ESSAYS WAS SOMETHING ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT FROM PSYCHOLOGY: AN UNEQUALED PROBLEM OF EDUCATION, A NEW CONCEPT OF SELF-DISCIPLINE, SELF-DEFENSE TO THE POINT OF HARDNESS, A WAY TO GREATNESS AND WORLD-HISTORICAL TASKS WAS SEEKING ITS FIRST EXPRESSION. BROADLY SPEAKING, I CAUGHT HOLD OF TWO FAMOUS AND AS YET ALTOGETHER UNDIAGNOSED TYPES, AS ONE CATCHES HOLD OF AN OPPORTUNITY, IN ORDER TO SAY SOMETHING, IN ORDER TO HAVE AT HAND A FEW MORE FORMULAS, SIGNS, MEANS OF LANGUAGE. THIS IS REALLY SUGGESTED WITH A PERFECTLY UNCANNY SAGACITY NEAR THE END OF SECTION 7 IN THE THIRD UNTIMELY ONE. PLATO EMPLOYED SOCRATES IN THIS FASHION, AS A [SIGN LANGUAGE FOR PLATO].1

NOW THAT I AM LOOKING BACK FROM A CERTAIN DISTANCE UPON THE CONDITIONS OF WHICH THESE ESSAYS BEAR WITNESS, I DO NOT WISH TO DENY THAT AT BOTTOM THEY SPEAK ONLY OF ME. THE ESSAY WAGNER IN BAYREUTH IS A VISION OF MY FUTURE, WHILE IN SCHOPENHAUER AS EDUCATOR MY INNERMOST HISTORY, MY BECOMING, IS INSCRIBED. ABOVE ALL, MY PROMISE!

WHAT I AM TODAY, WHERE I AM TODAY‚ÄÎAT A HEIGHT WHERE I SPEAK NO LONGER WITH WORDS BUT WITH LIGHTNING BOLTS‚ÄÎAH, HOW REMOTE FROM THIS I STILL WAS AT THAT TIME!‚ÄÎBUT I BEHELD THE LAND‚ÄÎI DID NOT DECEIVE MYSELF FOR A MOMENT ABOUT THE WAY, THE SEA, THE DANGER‚ÄÎAND SUCCESS. THE GREAT CALM IN PROMISING, THIS HAPPY GAZE INTO A FUTURE THAT IS NOT TO REMAIN A MERE PROMISE!

HERE EVERY WORD IS EXPERIENCED, IS DEEP, IS INWARD; WHAT IS MOST PAINFUL IS NOT LACKING: THERE ARE WORDS IN IT THAT ARE VIRTUALLY BLOODTHIRSTY. BUT A WIND OF THE GREAT FREEDOM BLOWS OVER EVERYTHING; EVEN WOUNDS DO NOT HAVE THE EFFECT OF OBJECTIONS.

HOW I UNDERSTAND THE PHILOSOPHER‚ÄÎAS A TERRIBLE EXPLOSIVE, ENDANGERING EVERYTHING‚ÄÎHOW MY CONCEPT OF THE PHILOSOPHER IS WORLDS REMOVED FROM ANY CONCEPT THAT WOULD INCLUDE EVEN A KANT, NOT TO SPEAK OF ACADEMIC ‚ÄÚRUMINANTS‚ÄÙ AND OTHER PROFESSORS OF PHILOSOPHY‚ÄÎTHIS ESSAY GIVES INESTIMABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT, ALTHOUGH AT BOTTOM IT IS ADMITTEDLY NOT ‚ÄÚSCHOPENHAUER AS EDUCATOR‚ÄÙ THAT SPEAKS HERE, BUT HIS OPPOSITE, ‚ÄÚNIETZSCHE AS EDUCATOR.‚ÄÙ

CONSIDERING THAT IN THOSE DAYS I PRACTICED THE SCHOLAR‚ÄÔS CRAFT, AND PERHAPS KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS CRAFT, THE HARSH PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SCHOLAR THAT SUDDENLY EMERGES IN THIS ESSAY IS OF SOME SIGNIFICANCE: IT EXPRESSES THE FEELING OF DISTANCE,2 THE PROFOUND ASSURANCE ABOUT WHAT COULD BE MY TASK AND WHAT COULD ONLY BE MEANS, ENTR‚ÄÔACTE, AND MINOR WORKS. IT SHOWS MY PRUDENCE THAT I WAS MANY THINGS AND IN MANY PLACES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BECOME ONE THING‚ÄÎTO BE ABLE TO ATTAIN ONE THING. I HAD TO BE A SCHOLAR, TOO, FOR SOME TIME.3

2THE WORD HAD ACTUALLY BEEN USED EARLIER BY GUSTAV TEICHM√ºLLER (1832‚ÄÌ1888), A PROFESSOR AT BASEL FROM 1868 TO 1871; BUT NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS CLAIM (IST VON MEINER SCHRIFT HER IN DER SPRACHE √ºBRIGGEBLIEBEN) IS LITERALLY TRUE. FOR ALL THAT, HE WOULD HARDLY HAVE SAID THIS IF HE HAD REMEMBERED THAT THE COINAGE WAS TEICHM√ºLLER‚ÄÔS.

3HEINRICH EWALD (1803‚ÄÌ1875), A VERY EMINENT OLD TESTAMENT SCHOLAR AND ORIENTALIST, WAS ONE OF THE CELEBRATED ‚ÄÚG√∂TTINGEN SEVEN‚ÄÙ WHO IN 1837 WERE EXPELLED FROM THE UNIVERSITY BECAUSE THEY HAD SIGNED A LIBERAL MANIFESTO; HE WENT TO T√ºBINGEN, BUT RETURNED TO G√∂TTINGEN IN 1848‚ÄÎAND WAS PENSIONED OFF IN 1867 BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO SWEAR AN OATH OF ALLEGIANCE TO THE KING OF PRUSSIA.

4BRUNO BAUER (1809‚ÄÌ82) STARTED OUT AS A RIGHT-WING, CONSERVATIVE HEGELIAN AND BECAME A PROFESSOR OF THEOLOGY AT BONN IN 1839. IN 1840 AND 1841 HE PUBLISHED TWO VOLUMES OF NEW TESTAMENT CRITICISM, AND IN 1842 HE WAS DEPRIVED OF THE RIGHT TO TEACH. NOW HE WAS ACCOUNTED A ‚ÄÚYOUNG‚ÄÙ OR LEFT-WING HEGELIAN, AND HE HAS BEEN CALLED ‚ÄÚTHE MOST RADICAL OF THE NEW TESTAMENT CRITICS OF HIS AGE.‚ÄÙ HE ATTACKED DAVID FRIEDRICH STRAUSS‚ÄÔS IDEAS ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF CHRISTIANITY AND EMPHASIZED HELLENISTIC INFLUENCES. ALBERT SCHWEITZER PRAISED HIM HIGHLY IN HIS GESCHICHTE DER LEBEN JESU FORSCHUNG (T√ºBINGEN 1921, P. 161; THE QUEST OF THE HISTORICAL JESUS) FOR HAVING ASSEMBLED THE MOST BRILLIANT AND COMPLETE SUMMARY OF THE DIFFICULTIES PRESENTED BY THE LIFE OF JESUS. MARX‚ÄÔS AND ENGELS‚ÄÔ ATTACKS ON BAUER, AS ‚ÄÚST. BRUNO,‚ÄÙ WRITTEN IN 1845/46, ARE INCLUDED IN DIE DEUTSCHE IDEOLOGIE (PUBLISHED POSTHUMOUSLY IN 1932; THE GERMAN IDEOLOGY). BAUER‚ÄÔS IDEAS ARE ALSO DISCUSSED BY KARL L√∂WITH IN VON HEGEL BIS NIETZSCHE (EUROPA VERLAG, ZURICH AND NEW YORK 1941; FROM HEGEL TO NIETZSCHE, HOLT, RINEHART AND WINSTON, NEW YORK 1964).

WHAT NIETZSCHE CLAIMS MAY SOUND FARFETCHED, BUT ACTUALLY THE FIRST SECTION OF SCHOPENHAUER AS EDUCATOR MAKES THIS POINT VERY PLAINLY. THE QUESTION IS RAISED HOW WE CAN REALIZE OUR TRUE SELF, AND THE PRESCRIPTION IS THAT WE SHOULD ASK OURSELVES: ‚ÄÚWHAT HAVE YOU REALLY LOVED TILL NOW?‚ÄÙ FOR ‚ÄÚYOUR TRUE SELF DOES NOT LIE DEEPLY CONCEALED WITHIN YOU BUT IMMEASURABLY HIGH ABOVE YOU, OR AT LEAST ABOVE WHAT YOU USUALLY TAKE FOR YOUR EGO.

HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN WITH TWO SEQUELS





1


HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN IS THE MONUMENT OF A CRISIS. IT IS SUBTITLED ‚ÄÚA BOOK FOR FREE SPIRITS‚ÄÙ: ALMOST EVERY SENTENCE MARKS SOME VICTORY‚ÄÎHERE I LIBERATED MYSELF FROM WHAT IN MY NATURE DID NOT BELONG TO ME. IDEALISM, FOR EXAMPLE; THE TITLE MEANS: ‚ÄÚWHERE YOU SEE IDEAL THINGS, I SEE WHAT IS‚ÄÎHUMAN, ALAS, ALL-TOO-HUMAN!‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎI KNOW MAN BETTER.

THE TERM ‚ÄÚFREE SPIRIT‚ÄÙ HERE IS NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD IN ANY OTHER SENSE; IT MEANS A SPIRIT THAT HAS BECOME FREE,1 THAT HAS AGAIN TAKEN POSSESSION OF ITSELF. THE TONE, THE VOICE, IS COMPLETELY CHANGED: YOU WILL FIND THE BOOK CLEVER, COOL, PERHAPS HARD AND MOCKING. A CERTAIN SPIRITUALITY OF NOBLE TASTE SEEMS TO BE FIGHTING CONTINUALLY AGAINST A MORE PASSIONATE CURRENT IN ORDER TO STAY AFLOAT. IN THIS CONNECTION IT MAKES SENSE THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY THE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF VOLTAIRE THAT THE BOOK PLEADED, AS IT WERE, AS AN EXCUSE FOR COMING OUT IN 1878.2 FOR VOLTAIRE WAS ABOVE ALL, IN CONTRAST TO ALL WHO WROTE AFTER HIM, A GRANDSEIGNEUR3 OF THE SPIRIT‚ÄÎLIKE ME.‚ÄÎTHE NAME OF VOLTAIRE ON ONE OF MY ESSAYS‚ÄÎTHAT REALLY MEANT PROGRESS‚ÄÎTOWARD ME.

ON CLOSER INSPECTION YOU DISCOVER A MERCILESS SPIRIT THAT KNOWS ALL THE HIDEOUTS WHERE THE IDEAL IS AT HOME‚ÄÎWHERE IT HAS ITS SECRET DUNGEONS AND, AS IT WERE, ITS ULTIMATE SAFETY. WITH A TORCH WHOSE LIGHT NEVER WAVERS, AN INCISIVE LIGHT IS THROWN INTO THIS UNDERWORLD OF THE IDEAL. THIS IS WAR, BUT WAR WITHOUT POWDER AND SMOKE, WITHOUT WARLIKE POSES, WITHOUT PATHOS AND STRAINED LIMBS:4 ALL THAT WOULD STILL BE ‚ÄÚIDEALISM.‚ÄÙ ONE ERROR AFTER ANOTHER IS COOLLY PLACED ON ICE; THE IDEAL IS NOT REFUTED‚ÄÎIT FREEZES TO DEATH.‚ÄÎHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, ‚ÄÚTHE GENIUS‚ÄÙ FREEZES TO DEATH; AT THE NEXT CORNER, ‚ÄÚTHE SAINT;‚ÄÙ UNDER A HUGE ICICLE, ‚ÄÚTHE HERO;‚ÄÙ IN THE END, ‚ÄÚFAITH,‚ÄÙ SO-CALLED ‚ÄÚCONVICTION;‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚPITY‚ÄÙ ALSO COOLS DOWN CONSIDERABLY‚ÄÎAND ALMOST EVERYWHERE ‚ÄÚTHE THING IN ITSELF‚ÄÙ FREEZES TO DEATH.

THE BEGINNINGS OF THIS BOOK BELONG RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THE FIRST BAYREUTHER FESTSPIELE;1 A PROFOUND ALIENATION FROM EVERYTHING THAT SURROUNDED ME THERE IS ONE OF ITS PRECONDITIONS. WHOEVER HAS ANY NOTION OF THE VISIONS I HAD ENCOUNTERED EVEN BEFORE THAT, MAY GUESS HOW I FELT WHEN ONE DAY I WOKE UP IN BAYREUTH. AS IF I WERE DREAMING!

WHEREVER WAS I? THERE WAS NOTHING I RECOGNIZED; I SCARCELY RECOGNIZED WAGNER. IN VAIN DID I LEAF THROUGH MY MEMORIES. TRIBSCHEN‚ÄÎA DISTANT ISLE OF THE BLESSED: NOT A TRACE OF ANY SIMILARITY. THE INCOMPARABLE DAYS WHEN THE FOUNDATION STONE WAS LAID, THE SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT HAD BELONGED, HAD CELEBRATED, AND DID NOT NEED FIRST TO ACQUIRE FINGERS FOR DELICATE MATTERS‚ÄÎNOT A TRACE OF ANY SIMILARITY. WHAT HAD HAPPENED?‚ÄÎWAGNER HAD BEEN TRANSLATED INTO GERMAN! THE WAGNERIAN HAD BECOME MASTER OVER WAGNER.‚ÄÎGERMAN ART. THE GERMAN MASTER. GERMAN BEER.

WE OTHERS, WHO KNOW ONLY TOO WELL TO WHAT SUBTLE ARTISTS AND WHAT COSMOPOLITANISM OF TASTE WAGNER‚ÄÔS ART SPEAKS, EXCLUSIVELY, WERE BESIDE OURSELVES WHEN WE FOUND WAGNER AGAIN, DRAPED WITH GERMAN ‚ÄÚVIRTUES.‚ÄÙ

I THINK I KNOW THE WAGNERIANS; I HAVE EXPERIENCED THREE GENERATIONS, BEGINNING WITH THE LATE BRENDEL2 WHO CONFOUNDED WAGNER AND HEGEL, DOWN TO THE ‚ÄÚIDEALISTS‚ÄÙ OF THE BAYREUTHER BL√§TTER3 WHO CONFOUND WAGNER AND THEMSELVES‚ÄÎI HAVE HEARD EVERY KIND OF CONFESSION OF ‚ÄÚBEAUTIFUL SOULS‚ÄÙ ABOUT WAGNER. A KINGDOM FOR ONE SENSIBLE WORD!‚ÄÎIN TRUTH, A HAIR-RAISING COMPANY! NOHL, POHL, KOHL‚ÄÎDROLL WITH CHARM, IN INFINITUM!4 NOT A SINGLE ABORTION IS MISSING AMONG THEM, NOT EVEN THE ANTI-SEMITE.‚ÄÎPOOR WAGNER! WHERE HAD HE LANDED!‚ÄÎIF HE HAD AT LEAST ENTERED INTO SWINE!5 BUT TO DESCEND AMONG GERMANS!

REALLY, FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF POSTERITY ONE OUGHT TO STUFF A GENUINE BAYREUTHER OR, BETTER YET, PRESERVE HIM IN SPIRITS, FOR SPIRITS ARE LACKING‚ÄÎWITH THE LABEL: THAT IS HOW THE ‚ÄÚSPIRIT‚ÄÙ LOOKED ON WHICH THE REICH WAS FOUNDED.

ENOUGH; IN THE MIDST OF IT I LEFT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS,6 VERY SUDDENLY, ALTHOUGH A CHARMING PARISIENNE TRIED TO CONSOLE ME; THE ONLY EXCUSE I OFFERED WAGNER WAS A FATALISTIC TELEGRAM. IN KLINGENBRUNN, A SMALL TOWN CONCEALED IN THE WOODS OF THE B√∂HMERWALD, I DRAGGED AROUND MY MELANCHOLY AND CONTEMPT FOR GERMANS LIKE A DISEASE‚ÄÎAND FROM TIME TO TIME I‚ÄÔD WRITE A SENTENCE INTO MY NOTEBOOK, UNDER THE GENERAL TITLE ‚ÄÒTHE PLOWSHARE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHARD PSYCHOLOGICA THAT CAN PERHAPS STILL BE FOUND IN HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN.

WHAT REACHED A DECISION IN ME AT THAT TIME WAS NOT A BREAK WITH WAGNER: I NOTED A TOTAL ABERRATION OF MY INSTINCTS OF WHICH PARTICULAR BLUNDERS, WHETHER WAGNER OR THE PROFESSORSHIP AT BASEL, WERE MERE SYMPTOMS. I WAS OVERCOME BY IMPATIENCE WITH MYSELF; I SAW THAT IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR ME TO RECALL AND REFLECT ON MYSELF. ALL AT ONCE IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME IN A TERRIFYING WAY HOW MUCH TIME I HAD ALREADY WASTED‚ÄÎHOW USELESS AND ARBITRARY MY WHOLE EXISTENCE AS A PHILOLOGIST APPEARED IN RELATION TO MY TASK. I FELT ASHAMED OF THIS FALSE MODESTY.

TEN YEARS LAY BEHIND ME IN WHICH THE NOURISHMENT OF MY SPIRIT HAD REALLY COME TO A STOP; I HAD NOT LEARNED ANYTHING NEW THAT WAS USEFUL; I HAD FORGOTTEN AN ABSURD AMOUNT FOR THE SAKE OF DUSTY SCHOLARLY GEWGAWS. CRAWLING SCRUPULOUSLY WITH BAD EYES THROUGH ANCIENT METRISTS‚ÄÎTHAT‚ÄÔS WHAT I HAD COME TO!‚ÄÎIT STIRRED MY COMPASSION TO SEE MYSELF UTTERLY EMACIATED, UTTERLY STARVED: MY KNOWLEDGE SIMPLY FAILED TO INCLUDE REALITIES, AND MY ‚ÄÚIDEALITIES‚ÄÙ WERE NOT WORTH A DAMN.

A TRULY BURNING THIRST TOOK HOLD OF ME: HENCEFORTH I REALLY PURSUED NOTHING MORE1 THAN PHYSIOLOGY, MEDICINE, AND NATURAL SCIENCES‚ÄÎAND I DID NOT RETURN EVEN TO PROPERLY HISTORICAL STUDIES UNTIL MY TASK COMPELLED ME TO, IMPERIOUSLY. IT WAS THEN, TOO, THAT I FIRST GUESSED HOW AN ACTIVITY CHOSEN IN DEFIANCE OF ONE‚ÄÔS INSTINCTS, A SO-CALLED ‚ÄÚVOCATION‚ÄÙ FOR WHICH ONE DOES NOT HAVE THE LEAST VOCATION, IS RELATED TO THE NEED FOR DEADENING THE FEELING OF DESOLATION AND HUNGER BY MEANS OF A NARCOTIC ART‚ÄÎFOR EXAMPLE, WAGNERIAN ART.

LOOKING ABOUT ME CAUTIOUSLY, I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF YOUNG MEN EXPERIENCE THE SAME DISTRESS: ONE ANTINATURAL STEP VIRTUALLY COMPELS THE SECOND. IN GERMANY, IN THE REICH‚ÄÎTO SPEAK UNAMBIGUOUSLY‚ÄÎALL TOO MANY ARE CONDEMNED TO CHOOSE VOCATIONS TOO EARLY, AND THEN TO WASTE AWAY UNDER, A BURDEN THEY CAN NO LONGER SHAKE OFF.‚ÄÎTHESE PEOPLE REQUIRE WAGNER AS AN OPIATE: THEY FORGET THEMSELVES, THEY ARE RID OF THEMSELVES FOR A MOMENT.‚ÄÎWHAT AM I SAYING? FOR FIVE OR SIX HOURS!

IT WAS THEN THAT MY INSTINCT MADE ITS INEXORABLE DECISION AGAINST ANY LONGER YIELDING, GOING ALONG, AND CONFOUNDING MYSELF. ANY KIND OF LIFE, THE MOST UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS, SICKNESS, POVERTY‚ÄÎANYTHING SEEMED PREFERABLE TO THAT UNSEEMLY ‚ÄÚSELFLESSNESS‚ÄÙ INTO WHICH I HAD GOT MYSELF ORIGINALLY IN IGNORANCE AND YOUTH AND IN WHICH I HAD GOT STUCK LATER ON FROM INERTIA AND SO-CALLED ‚ÄÚSENSE OF DUTY.‚ÄÙ1

HERE IT HAPPENED IN A MANNER THAT I CANNOT ADMIRE SUFFICIENTLY THAT, PRECISELY AT THE RIGHT TIME, MY FATHER‚ÄÔS WICKED HERITAGE CAME TO MY AID‚ÄÎAT BOTTOM, PREDESTINATION TO AN EARLY DEATH.2 SICKNESS DETACHED ME SLOWLY: IT SPARED ME ANY BREAK, ANY VIOLENT AND OFFENSIVE STEP. THUS I DID NOT LOSE ANY GOOD WILL AND ACTUALLY GAINED NOT A LITTLE. MY SICKNESS ALSO GAVE ME THE RIGHT TO CHANGE ALL MY HABITS COMPLETELY; IT PERMITTED, IT COMMANDED ME TO FORGET; IT BESTOWED ON ME THE NECESSITY OF LYING STILL, OF LEISURE, OF WAITING AND BEING PATIENT.‚ÄÎBUT THAT MEANS, OF THINKING.‚ÄÎMY EYES ALONE PUT AN END TO ALL BOOKWORMISHNESS‚ÄÎIN BRIEF, PHILOLOGY: I WAS DELIVERED FROM THE ‚ÄÚBOOK;‚ÄÙ FOR YEARS I DID NOT READ A THING‚ÄÎTHE GREATEST BENEFIT I EVER CONFERRED ON MYSELF.‚ÄÎTHAT NETHERMOST SELF WHICH HAD, AS IT WERE, BEEN BURIED AND GROWN SILENT UNDER THE CONTINUAL PRESSURE OF HAVING TO LISTEN TO OTHER SELVES (AND THAT IS AFTER ALL WHAT READING MEANS) AWAKENED SLOWLY, SHYLY, DUBIOUSLY‚ÄÎBUT EVENTUALLY IT SPOKE AGAIN. NEVER HAVE I FELT HAPPIER WITH MYSELF THAN IN THE SICKEST AND MOST PAINFUL PERIODS OF MY LIFE: ONE ONLY NEED LOOK AT THE DAWN OR PERHAPS THE WANDERER AND HIS SHADOW TO COMPREHEND WHAT THIS ‚ÄÚRETURN TO MYSELF‚ÄÙ MEANT‚ÄÎA SUPREME KIND OF RECOVERY.‚ÄÎTHE OTHER KIND MERELY FOLLOWED FROM THIS.

HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN, THIS MONUMENT OF RIGOROUS SELF-DISCIPLINE WITH WHICH I PUT A SUDDEN END TO ALL MY INFECTIONS WITH ‚ÄÚHIGHER SWINDLE,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚIDEALISM,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚBEAUTIFUL FEELINGS,‚ÄÙ AND OTHER EFFEMINACIES, WAS WRITTEN IN THE MAIN IN SORRENTO; IT WAS FINISHED AND RECEIVED ITS FINAL FORM DURING A WINTER IN BASEL, UNDER CONDITIONS INCOMPARABLY LESS FAVORABLE THAN THOSE IN SORRENTO. ULTIMATELY, HERR PETER GAST, WHO WAS THEN STUDYING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BASEL AND VERY DEVOTED TO ME, HAS THIS BOOK ON HIS CONSCIENCE. I DICTATED, MY HEAD BANDAGED AND IN PAIN; HE WROTE AND ALSO CORRECTED: FUNDAMENTALLY, HE WAS REALLY THE WRITER WHILE I WAS MERELY THE AUTHOR.

WHEN THE BOOK WAS FINALLY FINISHED AND IN MY HANDS‚ÄÎA PROFOUND SURPRISE FOR ONE SO SERIOUSLY ILL‚ÄÎI ALSO SENT TWO COPIES, AMONG OTHERS, TO BAYREUTH. BY A MIRACULOUSLY MEANINGFUL COINCIDENCE, I RECEIVED AT THE VERY SAME TIME A BEAUTIFUL COPY OF THE TEXT OF PARSIFAL, WITH WAGNER‚ÄÔS INSCRIPTION FOR ME, ‚ÄÚFOR HIS DEAR FRIEND, FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, RICHARD WAGNER, CHURCH COUNCILOR.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHIS CROSSING OF THE TWO BOOKS‚ÄÎI FELT AS IF I HEARD AN OMINOUS SOUND‚ÄÎAS IF TWO SWORDS HAD CROSSED.‚ÄÎAT ANY RATE, BOTH OF US FELT THAT WAY; FOR BOTH OF US REMAINED SILENT.‚ÄÎAROUND THAT TIME THE FIRST BAYREUTHER BL√§TTER APPEARED: I UNDERSTOOD FOR WHAT IT WAS HIGH TIME.‚ÄÎINCREDIBLE! WAGNER HAD BECOME PIOUS.

HOW I THOUGHT ABOUT MYSELF AT THIS TIME (1876), WITH WHAT TREMENDOUS SURENESS I GOT HOLD OF MY TASK AND ITS WORLD-HISTORICAL ASPECT‚ÄÎTHE WHOLE BOOK BEARS WITNESS TO THAT, ABOVE ALL A VERY EXPLICIT PASSAGE. ONLY, WITH MY INSTINCTIVE CUNNING, I AVOIDED THE LITTLE WORD ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÙ ONCE AGAIN AND BATHED IN WORLD-HISTORICAL GLORY‚ÄÎNOT SCHOPENHAUER OR WAGNER THIS TIME BUT ONE OF MY FRIENDS, THE EXCELLENT DR. PAUL R√©E‚ÄÎFORTUNATELY FAR TOO REFINED A CREATURE TO‚ÄÎ1

OTHERS WERE LESS REFINED: I HAVE ALWAYS RECOGNIZED WHO AMONG MY READERS WAS HOPELESS‚ÄÎFOR EXAMPLE, THE TYPICAL GERMAN PROFESSOR‚ÄÎBECAUSE ON THE BASIS OF THIS PASSAGE THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD TO UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE BOOK AS HIGHER R√©EALISM.‚ÄÎIN FACT, THE CONTENTS CONTRADICTED FIVE OR SIX PROPOSITIONS OF MY FRIEND‚ÄÎA POINT DISCUSSED IN THE PREFACE TO MY GENEALOGY OF MORALS.

THE PASSAGE READS: ‚ÄÚWHAT IS AFTER ALL THE MAIN PROPOSITION THAT ONE OF THE BOLDEST AND COLDEST THINKERS, THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK ON THE ORIGIN OF MORAL FEELINGS [READ: NIETZSCHE, THE FIRST IMMORALIST] HAS REACHED ON THE BASIS OF HIS INCISIVE AND PENETRATING ANALYSES OF HUMAN ACTIVITY? ‚ÄÒTHE MORAL MAN IS NO CLOSER TO THE INTELLIGIBLE WORLD THAN THE PHYSICAL MAN‚ÄÎFOR THERE IS NO INTELLIGIBLE WORLD ‚Ä¶‚ÄÔ THIS PROPOSITION, GROWN HARD AND SHARP UNDER THE HAMMER BLOW OF HISTORICAL INSIGHT [READ: REVALUATION OF ALL VALUES], MAY PERHAPS ONE DAY, IN SOME FUTURE‚ÄÎ1890!‚ÄÎSERVE AS THE AX SWUNG AGAINST THE ‚ÄÒMETAPHYSICAL NEED‚ÄÔ OF MANKIND‚ÄÎBUT WHETHER THAT WILL BE MORE OF A BLESSING OR A CURSE FOR MANKIND, WHO COULD SAY? BUT IN ANY CASE AS A PROPOSITION OF IMMENSE CONSEQUENCES, FRUITFUL AND TERRIBLE AT THE SAME TIME, LOOKING INTO THE WORLD WITH THAT JANUS FACE WHICH ALL GREAT INSIGHTS SHARE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ2

4CF. SECTION? OF THE FIRST CHAPTER, ABOVE; ALSO THE FIRST FOOTNOTE FOR THAT SECTION.

1THE WAGNER OPERA FESTIVALS AT BAYREUTH.

2KARL FRANZ BRENDEL (1811‚ÄÌ1868) WAS EDITOR OF THE NEUE ZEITSCHRIFT F√ºR MUSIK (NEW JOURNAL FOR MUSIC), 1845-1868, AND OF ANREGUNGEN F√ºR KUNST, LEBEN UND WISSENSCHAFT (STIMULATIONS FOR ART, LIFE AND SCIENCE), 1856-61. HE BECAME A CHAMPION OF WAGNER IN 1851.

3WAGNER‚ÄÔS NEW PERIODICAL.

4KARL FRIEDRICH LUDWIG NOHL (1831‚ÄÌ1885) WAS A PROFESSOR OF MUSIC AT THE UNIVERSITIES OF MUNICH AND HEIDELBERG, A PROLIFIC WRITER, ESPECIALLY ON MOZART AND BEETHOVEN, AND A DEDICATED WAGNERIAN. HIS PUBLICATIONS INCLUDE R. WAGNERS BEDEUTUNG F√ºR DIE NATIONALE KUNST (R. WAGNER‚ÄÔS SIGNIFICANCE FOR NATIONAL ART; VIENNA, 1883) AND DAS MODERNE MUSIKDRAMA (THE MODERN MUSIC DRAMA; VIENNA, 1884).

RICHARD POHL (1826‚ÄÌ1896) BECAME CO-EDITOR (WITH BRENDEL) OF ANREGUNGEN F√ºR KUNST, LEBEN UND WISSENSCHAFT, IN 1857. A WAGNERIAN SINCE 1846, HE WAS SOMETIMES CALLED ‚ÄÚTHE OLDEST WAGNERIAN.‚ÄÙ

KOHL, EMPHASIZED BY NIETZSCHE, MEANS DRIVEL OR TWADDLE AS WELL AS CABBAGE, AND ‚ÄÚDRIVEL‚ÄÙ IS CLEARLY THE PRIMARY MEANING INTENDED HERE (‚ÄÚDROLL‚ÄÙ REPRESENTS AN ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE SOMETHING OF THE SPIRIT OF THE PASSAGE). THIS DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN SOME INDIVIDUAL WITH THIS UNFORTUNATE NAME; E.G., A YOUNG MAN NAMED OTTO KOHL WAS A MEMBER OF A SMALL CIRCLE OF PHILOLOGY STUDENTS TO WHICH NIETZSCHE AND ERWIN ROHDE HAD BELONGED IN LEIPZIG.

A SUPERSEDED DRAFT FOR THIS SECTION CONTAINS TWO SHORT PASSAGES WORTH QUOTING HERE: ‚ÄÚTYPICAL WAS THE OLD KAISER [I.E., WILHELM I] WHO APPLAUDED WITH HIS HANDS WHILE SAYING LOUDLY TO HIS ADJUTANT, COUNT LEHNDORF: ‚ÄÒHIDEOUS! HIDEOUS!‚ÄÔ [SCHEUSSLICH! SCHEUSSLICH!]‚ÄÙ AND: ‚ÄÚIN THE MUSIC OF WAGNER, WHICH PERSUADED BY MEANS OF ITS SECRET SEXUALITY, ONE FOUND A BOND FOR A SOCIETY IN WHICH EVERYBODY PURSUED HIS OWN PLAISIRS [PLEASURES]. THE REST AND, IF YOU WILL, ALSO THE INNOCENCE OF THE MATTER, ITS ‚ÄÒIDEALISTS‚ÄÔ WERE THE IDIOTS, THE NOHL, POHL, KOHL‚ÄÎTHE LATTER, KNOWN TO ME, THE GENIUS LOCI [MINOR LOCAL DEITY] IN BAYREUTH ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ (PODACH, FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHES WERKE, 1961).

5LUKE 8:33.

6PODACH‚ÄÔS VITRIOLIC ATTACK ON NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS ACCOUNT OF HIS BREAK WITH WAGNER, AND ON ECCE HOMO GENERALLY, IS OFTEN OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE FACTS‚ÄÎAS WHEN HE SAYS OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS SISTER, IGNORING THESE WORDS: ‚ÄÚAFTER ALL, IT WAS SCARCELY FEASIBLE TO BLOW DOWN THE STORY IN ECCE HOMO LIKE A HOUSE OF CARDS, BY STATING THAT HER BROTHER, IN SPITE OF FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, HAD SOON RETURNED TO BAYREUTH ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ (P. 196).

1‚Ä¶ NICHTS MEHR GETRIEBEN ALS ‚Ä¶: IF THE ACCENT FALLS ON NICHTS, THE MEANING IS ‚ÄÚPURSUED NOTHING ANY MORE EXCEPT,‚ÄÙ WHICH IS PALPABLY FALSE AS A MATTER OF BIOGRAPHICAL FACT. IF THE ACCENT FALLS ON MEHR, THE MEANING IS THAT SUGGESTED ABOVE, WHICH MAY STILL BE CONSIDERED A RHETORICAL EXAGGERATION.

1THIS SPLENDID SENTENCE ILLUMINATES NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS IDEAS ABOUT ‚ÄÚSELF-LOVE‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚSELFLESSNESS.‚ÄÙ

2NIETZSCHE COLLAPSED A FEW WEEKS AFTER WRITING THIS. THIS PARAGRAPH ILLUSTRATES BEAUTIFULLY WHAT NIETZSCHE SAYS ABOUT AMOR FATI, FREEDOM FROM RESSENTIMENT, AND SAYING YES EVEN TO SUFFERING.

1PRESUMABLY: TO HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD AND TAKEN THIS LITERALLY.

2IN THE VARIOUS GERMAN EDITIONS OF ECCE HOMO THIS QUOTATION IS NOT PRINTED IN QUOTATION MARKS, AND NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS INSERTIONS ARE PLACED IN PARENTHESES RATHER THAN BRACKETS; NOR IS THERE ANY REFERENCE TO THE SOURCE OF THE QUOTATION: HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN, SECTION 37. AS A RESULT, IT IS LEFT UNCLEAR WHAT EXACTLY IS QUOTED AND WHAT IS NOT. OF COURSE, ‚ÄÚ‚ÄÎ1890!‚ÄÎ‚ÄÙ IS ALSO AN INSERTION NOT FOUND IN THE TEXT OF 1878. NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS OTHER DEVIATIONS FROM THE ORIGINAL TEXT ARE SO SLIGHT THAT THEY ARE NOT WORTH LISTING HERE, EXCEPT THAT THE QUOTATION FROM R√©E‚ÄÔS BOOK ORIGINALLY READ AS FOLLOWS: ‚ÄÚTHE MORAL MAN,‚ÄÙ SAYS HE, ‚ÄÚIS NO CLOSER TO THE INTELLIGIBLE (METAPHYSICAL) WORLD THAN THE PHYSICAL MAN.‚ÄÙ THE NEXT SIX WORDS WERE NOT QUOTED IN HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN.

THOUGHTS ABOUT MORALITY AS A PREJUDICE

WITH THIS BOOK MY CAMPAIGN AGAINST MORALITY BEGINS. NOT THAT IT SMELLS IN THE LEAST OF POWDER: YOU WILL SMELL FAR DIFFERENT AND MUCH LOVELIER SCENTS IN IT, ASSUMING YOUR NOSTRILS HAVE SOME SENSITIVITY. NEITHER BIG NOR SMALL GUNS: IF THE EFFECT OF THE BOOK IS NEGATIVE, ITS MEANS ARE ANYTHING BUT THAT‚ÄÎTHESE MEANS FROM WHICH THE EFFECT ISSUES LIKE AN INFERENCE, NOT LIKE A CANNON SHOT. IF ONE TAKES LEAVE OF THE BOOK WITH A CAUTIOUS RESERVE ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT HAS SO FAR ATTAINED HONOR AND EVEN WORSHIP UNDER THE NAME OF MORALITY, THIS IN NO WAY CONTRADICTS THE FACT THAT THE WHOLE BOOK CONTAINS NO NEGATIVE WORD, NO ATTACK, NO SPITE‚ÄÎTHAT IT LIES IN THE SUN, ROUND, HAPPY, LIKE SOME SEA ANIMAL BASKING AMONG ROCKS.

ULTIMATELY, I MYSELF WAS THIS SEA ANIMAL: ALMOST EVERY SENTENCE IN THIS BOOK WAS FIRST THOUGHT, CAUGHT AMONG THAT JUMBLE OF ROCKS NEAR GENOA WHERE I WAS ALONE AND STILL HAD SECRETS WITH THE SEA. EVEN NOW, WHENEVER I ACCIDENTALLY TOUCH THIS BOOK, ALMOST EVERY SENTENCE TURNS FOR ME INTO A NET THAT AGAIN BRINGS UP FROM THE DEPTHS SOMETHING INCOMPARABLE: ITS ENTIRE SKIN TREMBLES WITH TENDER THRILLS OF MEMORY. THE ART THAT DISTINGUISHES IT IS NOT INCONSIDERABLE WHEN IT COMES TO FIXING TO SOME EXTENT THINGS THAT EASILY FLIT BY, NOISELESSLY‚ÄÎMOMENTS I CALL DIVINE LIZARDS‚ÄÎBUT NOT WITH THE CRUELTY OF THAT YOUNG GREEK GOD WHO SIMPLY SPEARED THE POOR LITTLE LIZARD, THOUGH, TO BE SURE, WITH SOMETHING POINTED‚ÄÎA PEN.

‚ÄÚTHERE ARE SO MANY DAWNS THAT HAVE NOT YET GLOWED‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHIS INDIAN INSCRIPTION MARKS THE OPENING OF THIS BOOK. WHERE DOES ITS AUTHOR SEEK THAT NEW MORNING, THAT AS YET UNDISCOVERED TENDER RED THAT MARKS THE BEGINNING OF ANOTHER DAY‚ÄÎAH, A WHOLE SERIES, A WHOLE WORLD OF NEW DAYS? IN A REVALUATION OF ALL VALUES, IN A LIBERATION FROM ALL MORAL VALUES, IN SAYING YES TO AND HAVING CONFIDENCE IN ALL THAT HAS HITHERTO BEEN FORBIDDEN, DESPISED, AND DAMNED. THIS YES-SAYING BOOK POURS OUT ITS LIGHT, ITS LOVE, ITS TENDERNESS UPON EVER SO MANY WICKED THINGS; IT GIVES BACK TO THEM THEIR ‚ÄÚSOUL,‚ÄÙ A GOOD CONSCIENCE, THE LOFTY RIGHT AND PRIVILEGE OF EXISTENCE. MORALITY IS NOT ATTACKED, IT IS MERELY NO LONGER IN THE PICTURE.

THIS BOOK CLOSES WITH AN ‚ÄÚOR?‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎIT IS THE ONLY BOOK THAT CLOSES WITH AN ‚ÄÚOR?‚ÄÙ

MY TASK OF PREPARING A MOMENT OF THE HIGHEST SELF-EXAMINATION FOR HUMANITY, A GREAT NOON WHEN IT LOOKS BACK AND FAR FORWARD, WHEN IT EMERGES FROM THE DOMINION OF ACCIDENTS AND PRIESTS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME POSES, AS A WHOLE, THE QUESTION OF WHY? AND FOR WHAT?‚ÄÎTHIS TASK FOLLOWS OF NECESSITY FROM THE INSIGHT THAT HUMANITY IS NOT ALL BY ITSELF ON THE RIGHT WAY, THAT IT IS BY NO MEANS GOVERNED DIVINELY, THAT, ON THE CONTRARY, IT HAS BEEN PRECISELY AMONG ITS HOLIEST VALUE CONCEPTS THAT THE INSTINCT OF DENIAL, CORRUPTION, AND DECADENCE HAS RULED SEDUCTIVELY. THE QUESTION CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF MORAL VALUES IS FOR ME A QUESTION OF THE VERY FIRST RANK BECAUSE IT IS CRUCIAL FOR THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY. THE DEMAND THAT WE SHOULD BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING IS REALLY IN THE BEST OF HANDS, THAT A BOOK, THE BIBLE, OFFERS US DEFINITIVE ASSURANCES ABOUT THE DIVINE GOVERNANCE AND WISDOM IN THE DESTINY OF MAN, IS‚ÄÎTRANSLATED BACK INTO REALITY‚ÄÎTHE WILL TO SUPPRESS THE TRUTH ABOUT THE PITIABLE OPPOSITE OF ALL THIS; NAMELY, THAT HUMANITY HAS SO FAR BEEN IN THE WORST OF HANDS AND THAT IT HAS BEEN GOVERNED BY THE UNDERPRIVILEGED, THE CRAFTILY VENGEFUL, THE SO-CALLED ‚ÄÚSAINTS,‚ÄÙ THESE SLANDERERS OF THE WORLD AND VIOLATORS OF MAN.

THE DECISIVE SYMPTOM THAT SHOWS HOW THE PRIEST (INCLUDING THOSE CRYPTO-PRIESTS, THE PHILOSOPHERS) HAS BECOME MASTER QUITE GENERALLY AND NOT ONLY WITHIN A CERTAIN RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY, AND THAT THE MORALITY OF DECADENCE, THE WILL TO THE END HAS BECOME ACCEPTED AS MORALITY ITSELF, IS THE FACT THAT WHAT IS UNEGOISTIC IS EVERYWHERE ASSIGNED ABSOLUTE VALUE WHILE WHAT IS EGOISTIC IS MET WITH HOSTILITY. WHOEVER IS AT ODDS WITH ME ABOUT THAT IS TO MY MIND INFECTED.‚ÄÎBUT ALL THE WORLD IS AT ODDS WITH ME.

FOR A PHYSIOLOGIST SUCH A JUXTAPOSITION OF VALUES SIMPLY LEAVES NO DOUBT. WHEN THE LEAST ORGAN IN AN ORGANISM FAILS, HOWEVER SLIGHTLY, TO ENFORCE WITH COMPLETE ASSURANCE ITS SELF-PRESERVATION, ITS ‚ÄÚEGOISM,‚ÄÙ RESTITUTION OF ITS ENERGIES‚ÄÎTHE WHOLE DEGENERATES. THE PHYSIOLOGIST DEMANDS EXCISION OF THE DEGENERATING PART; HE DENIES ALL SOLIDARITY WITH WHAT DEGENERATES; HE IS WORLDS REMOVED FROM PITY FOR IT. BUT THE PRIEST DESIRES PRECISELY THE DEGENERATION OF THE WHOLE, OF HUMANITY: FOR THAT REASON, HE CONSERVES WHAT DEGENERATES‚ÄÎAT THIS PRICE HE RULES.

WHEN SERIOUSNESS IS DEFLECTED FROM THE SELF-PRESERVATION AND THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE STRENGTH OF THE BODY‚ÄÎTHAT IS, OF LIFE‚ÄÎWHEN ANEMIA IS CONSTRUED AS AN IDEAL, AND CONTEMPT FOR THE BODY AS ‚ÄÚSALVATION OF THE SOUL‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWHAT ELSE IS THIS IF NOT A RECIPE FOR DECADENCE?

THE LOSS OF THE CENTER OF GRAVITY, RESISTANCE TO THE NATURAL INSTINCTS‚ÄÎIN ONE WORD, ‚ÄÚSELFLESSNESS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT IS WHAT WAS HITHERTO CALLED MORALITY.‚ÄÎWITH THE DAWN I FIRST TOOK UP THE FIGHT AGAINST THE MORALITY THAT WOULD UNSELF MAN.1

THE GAY SCIENCE

(‚ÄÚLA GAYA SCIENZA‚ÄÙ)


THE DAWN IS A YES-SAYING BOOK, DEEP BUT BRIGHT AND GRACIOUS. THE SAME IS TRUE ALSO AND IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF THE GAYA SCIENZA: IN ALMOST EVERY SENTENCE PROFUNDITY AND HIGH SPIRITS GO TENDERLY HAND IN HAND. SOME VERSES THAT EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR THE MOST WONDERFUL MONTH OF JANUARY I EVER EXPERIENCED‚ÄÎTHIS WHOLE BOOK WAS ITS PRESENT‚ÄÎREVEALS SUFFICIENTLY FROM WHAT DEPTHS THIS ‚ÄÚSCIENCE‚ÄÙ EMERGED TO GAIETY:

WITH A FLAMING SPEAR YOU PARTED

ALL ITS ICE UNTIL MY SOUL

HURRIES ROARING TOWARD THE OCEAN

OF ITS HIGHEST HOPE AND GOAL:

EVER HEALTHIER AND BRIGHTER,

IN MOST LOVING CONSTRAINT, FREE‚ÄÎ

THUS IT PRAISES YOUR GREAT WONDERS,

FAIREST MONTH OF JANUARY!1



WHAT IS HERE CALLED ‚ÄÚHIGHEST HOPE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWHO COULD HAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT THAT WHEN HE SEES THE DIAMOND BEAUTY OF THE FIRST WORDS OF ZARATHUSTRA FLASHING AT THE END OF THE FOURTH BOOK?‚ÄÎOR WHEN AT THE END OF THE THIRD BOOK HE READS THE GRANITE WORDS IN WHICH A DESTINY FINDS FOR THE FIRST TIME A FORMULA FOR ITSELF, FOR ALL TIME?2

THE ‚ÄÚSONGS OF PRINCE FREE-AS-A-BIRD,‚ÄÙ3 WRITTEN FOR THE MOST PART IN SICILY, ARE QUITE EMPHATICALLY REMINISCENT OF THE PROVEN√ßAL CONCEPT OF GAYA SCIENZA‚ÄÎTHAT UNITY OF SINGER, KNIGHT, AND FREE SPIRIT WHICH DISTINGUISHES THE WONDERFUL EARLY CULTURE OF THE PROVEN√ßALS FROM ALL EQUIVOCAL CULTURES. THE VERY LAST POEM ABOVE ALL, ‚ÄÚTO THE MISTRAL,‚ÄÙ4 AN EXUBERANT DANCING SONG IN WHICH, IF I MAY SAY SO, ONE DANCES RIGHT OVER MORALITY, IS A PERFECT PROVEN√ßALISM.

THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA

A BOOK FOR ALL AND NONE





1


NOW I SHALL RELATE THE HISTORY OF ZARATHUSTRA. THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTION OF THIS WORK, THE IDEA OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE, THIS HIGHEST FORMULA OF AFFIRMATION THAT IS AT ALL ATTAINABLE, BELONGS IN AUGUST 1881: IT WAS PENNED ON A SHEET WITH THE NOTATION UNDERNEATH, ‚ÄÚ6000 FEET BEYOND MAN AND TIME.‚ÄÙ THAT DAY I WAS WALKING THROUGH THE WOODS ALONG THE LAKE OF SILVAPLANA; AT A POWERFUL PYRAMIDAL ROCK NOT FAR FROM SURLEI I STOPPED.1 IT WAS THEN THAT THIS IDEA CAME TOME.

IF I RECKON BACK A FEW MONTHS FROM THIS DAY, I FIND AS AN OMEN A SUDDEN AND PROFOUNDLY DECISIVE CHANGE IN MY TASTE, ESPECIALLY IN MUSIC. PERHAPS THE WHOLE OF ZARATHUSTRA MAY BE RECKONED AS MUSIC; CERTAINLY A REBIRTH OF THE ART OF HEARING WAS AMONG ITS PRECONDITIONS. IN A SMALL MOUNTAIN SPA NOT FAR FROM VICENZA, RECOARO, WHERE I SPENT THE SPRING OF 1881, I DISCOVERED TOGETHER WITH MY MAESTRO AND FRIEND, PETER GAST, WHO WAS ALSO ‚ÄÚREBORN,‚ÄÙ THAT THE PHOENIX OF MUSIC FLEW PAST US WITH LIGHTER AND MORE BRILLIANT FEATHERS THAN IT HAD EVER DISPLAYED BEFORE. BUT IF I RECKON FORWARD FROM THAT DAY TO THE SUDDEN BIRTH THAT OCCURRED IN FEBRUARY 1883 UNDER THE MOST IMPROBABLE CIRCUMSTANCES‚ÄÎTHE FINALE FROM WHICH I HAVE QUOTED A FEW SENTENCES IN THE PREFACE WAS FINISHED EXACTLY IN THAT SACRED HOUR IN WHICH RICHARD WAGNER DIED IN VENICE‚ÄÎWE GET EIGHTEEN MONTHS FOR THE PREGNANCY. THIS FIGURE OF PRECISELY EIGHTEEN MONTHS MIGHT SUGGEST, AT LEAST TO BUDDHISTS, THAT I AM REALLY A FEMALE ELEPHANT.

MY GAYA SCIENZA BELONGS IN THE INTERVAL AND CONTAINS A HUNDRED SIGNS OF THE PROXIMITY OF SOMETHING INCOMPARABLE; IN THE END IT EVEN OFFERS THE BEGINNING OF ZARATHUSTRA, AND IN THE PENULTIMATE SECTION OF THE FOURTH BOOK THE BASIC IDEA OF ZARATHUSTRA.2

SOMETHING ELSE ALSO BELONGS IN THIS INTERVAL: THAT HYMN TO LIFE (FOR MIXED CHOIR AND ORCHESTRA) WHOSE SCORE WAS PUBLISHED TWO YEARS AGO BY E. W. FRITZSCH IN LEIPZIG‚ÄÎA SCARCELY TRIVIAL SYMPTOM OF MY CONDITION DURING THAT YEAR WHEN THE YES-SAYING PATHOS PAR EXCELLENCE, WHICH I CALL THE TRAGIC PATHOS, WAS ALIVE IN ME TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE. THE TIME WILL COME WHEN IT WILL BE SUNG IN MY MEMORY.3

THE TEXT, TO SAY THIS EXPRESSLY BECAUSE A MISUNDERSTANDING HAS GAINED CURRENCY, IS NOT BY ME: IT IS THE AMAZING INSPIRATION OF A YOUNG RUSSIAN WOMAN WHO WAS MY FRIEND AT THAT TIME, MISS LOU VON SALOM√©.4 WHOEVER CAN FIND ANY MEANING AT ALL IN THE LAST WORDS OF THIS POEM WILL GUESS WHY I PREFERRED AND ADMIRED IT: THEY ATTAIN GREATNESS. PAIN IS NOT CONSIDERED AN OBJECTION TO LIFE: ‚ÄÚIF YOU HAVE NO MORE HAPPINESS TO GIVE ME, WELL THEN! YOU STILL HAVE SUFFERING.‚ÄÙ PERHAPS MY MUSIC, TOO, ATTAINS GREATNESS AT THIS POINT. (LAST NOTE OF THE A-CLARINET, C FLAT, NOT C: MISPRINT.)

THE FOLLOWING WINTER I STAYED IN THAT CHARMING QUIET BAY OF RAPALLO WHICH, NOT FAR FROM GENOA, IS CUT OUT BETWEEN CHIAVARI AND THE FOOTHILLS OF PORTOFINO. MY HEALTH COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER; THE WINTER WAS COLD AND EXCESSIVELY RAINY; MY SMALL ALBERGO5 SITUATED RIGHT AT THE SEA SO THAT THE HIGH SEA MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SLEEP AT NIGHT, WAS IN JUST ABOUT EVERY WAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT ONE MIGHT WISH FOR. IN SPITE OF THIS AND ALMOST IN ORDER TO PROVE MY PROPOSITION THAT EVERYTHING DECISIVE COMES INTO BEING ‚ÄÚIN SPITE OF,‚ÄÙ IT WAS THAT WINTER AND UNDER THESE UNFAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MY ZARATHUSTRA CAME INTO BEING.

MORNINGS I WOULD WALK IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION ON THE SPLENDID ROAD TO ZOAGLI, GOING UP PAST PINES WITH A MAGNIFICENT VIEW OF THE SEA; IN THE AFTERNOON, WHENEVER MY HEALTH PERMITTED IT, I WALKED AROUND THE WHOLE BAY FROM SANTA MARGHERITA ALL THE WAY TO PORTOFINO. THIS PLACE AND THIS SCENERY CAME EVEN CLOSER TO MY HEART BECAUSE OF THE GREAT LOVE THAT EMPEROR FREDERICK III FELT FOR THEM; BY CHANCE, I WAS IN THIS COASTAL REGION AGAIN IN THE FALL OF 1886 WHEN HE VISITED THIS SMALL FORGOTTEN WORLD OF BLISS FOR THE LAST TIME.6 ‚ÄÎIT WAS ON THESE TWO WALKS THAT THE WHOLE OF ZARATHUSTRA I OCCURRED TO ME,7 AND ESPECIALLY ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF AS A TYPE: RATHER, HE OVERTOOK ME.8

TO UNDERSTAND THIS TYPE, ONE MUST FIRST BECOME CLEAR ABOUT HIS PHYSIOLOGICAL PRESUPPOSITION: THIS IS WHAT I CALL THE GREAT HEALTH. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HOW I COULD EXPLAIN THIS CONCEPT BETTER, MORE PERSONALLY, THAN I HAVE DONE IT IN ONE OF THE LAST SECTIONS OF THE FIFTH BOOK OF MY GAYA SCIENZA.1

BEING NEW, NAMELESS, SELF-EVIDENT, WE PREMATURE BIRTHS OF AN AS YET UNPROVEN FUTURE, WE NEED FOR A NEW GOAL ALSO A NEW MEANS‚ÄÎNAMELY, A NEW HEALTH, STRONGER, MORE SEASONED, TOUGHER, MORE AUDACIOUS, AND GAYER THAN ANY PREVIOUS HEALTH. WHOEVER HAS A SOUL THAT CRAVES TO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE WHOLE RANGE OF VALUES AND DESIDERATA TO DATE, AND TO HAVE SAILED AROUND ALL THE COASTS OF THIS IDEAL ‚ÄÚMEDITERRANEAN‚ÄÙ; WHOEVER WANTS TO KNOW FROM THE ADVENTURES OF HIS OWN MOST AUTHENTIC EXPERIENCE HOW A DISCOVERER AND CONQUEROR OF THE IDEAL FEELS, AND ALSO AN ARTIST, A SAINT, A LEGISLATOR, A SAGE, A SCHOLAR, A PIOUS MAN,2 AND ONE WHO STANDS DIVINELY, APART IN THE OLD STYLE‚ÄÎNEEDS ONE THING ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE: THE GREAT HEALTH‚ÄÎTHAT ONE DOES NOT MERELY HAVE BUT ALSO ACQUIRES CONTINUALLY, AND MUST ACQUIRE BECAUSE ONE GIVES IT UP AGAIN AND AGAIN, AND MUST GIVE IT UP.

AND NOW, AFTER WE HAVE LONG BEEN ON OUR WAY IN THIS MANNER, WE ARGONAUTS OF THE IDEAL, WITH MORE DARING PERHAPS THAN IS PRUDENT, AND HAVE SUFFERED SHIPWRECK AND DAMAGE OFTEN ENOUGH, BUT ARE, TO REPEAT IT, HEALTHIER THAN ONE LIKES TO PERMIT US, DANGEROUSLY HEALTHY, EVER AGAIN HEALTHY‚ÄÎIT WILL SEEM TO US AS IF, AS A REWARD, WE NOW CONFRONTED AN AS YET UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY WHOSE BOUNDARIES NOBODY HAS SURVEYED YET, SOMETHING BEYOND ALL THE LANDS AND NOOKS OF THE IDEAL SO FAR, A WORLD SO OVERRICH IN WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL, STRANGE, QUESTIONABLE, TERRIBLE, AND DIVINE THAT OUR CURIOSITY AS WELL AS OUR CRAVING TO POSSESS IT HAS GOT BESIDE ITSELF‚ÄÎALAS, NOW NOTHING WILL SATE US ANY MORE!

AFTER SUCH VISTAS AND WITH SUCH A BURNING HUNGER IN OUR CONSCIENCE AND SCIENCE,3 HOW COULD WE STILL BE SATISFIED WITH PRESENT-DAY MAN? IT MAY BE TOO BAD BUT IT IS INEVITABLE THAT WE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO REMAIN SERIOUS WHEN WE LOOK AT HIS WORTHIEST GOALS AND HOPES, AND PERHAPS WE DO NOT EVEN BOTHER TO LOOK ANY MORE.

ANOTHER IDEAL RUNS AHEAD OF US, A STRANGE, TEMPTING, DANGEROUS IDEAL TO WHICH WE SHOULD NOT WISH TO PERSUADE ANYBODY BECAUSE WE DO NOT READILY CONCEDE THE RIGHT TO IT TO ANYONE: THE IDEAL OF A SPIRIT WHO PLAYS NA√ØVELY‚ÄÎTHAT IS, NOT DELIBERATELY BUT FROM OVERFLOWING POWER AND ABUNDANCE‚ÄÎWITH ALL THAT WAS HITHERTO CALLED HOLY, GOOD, UNTOUCHABLE, DIVINE; FOR WHOM THOSE SUPREME THINGS THAT THE PEOPLE NATURALLY ACCEPT AS THEIR VALUE STANDARDS, SIGNIFY DANGER, DECAY, DEBASEMENT, OR AT LEAST RECREATION, BLINDNESS, AND TEMPORARY SELF-OBLIVION; THE IDEAL OF A HUMAN, SUPERHUMAN WELL-BEING AND BENEVOLENCE4 THAT WILL OFTEN APPEAR INHUMAN‚ÄÎFOR EXAMPLE, WHEN IT CONFRONTS ALL EARTHLY SERIOUSNESS SO FAR, ALL SOLEMNITY IN GESTURE, WORD, TONE, EYE, MORALITY, AND TASK SO FAR, AS IF IT WERE THEIR MOST INCARNATE AND INVOLUNTARY PARODY‚ÄÎAND IN SPITE OF ALL OF THIS, IT IS PERHAPS ONLY WITH HIM THAT GREAT SERIOUSNESS REALLY BEGINS, THAT THE REAL QUESTION MARK IS POSED FOR THE FIRST TIME, THAT THE DESTINY OF THE SOUL CHANGES, THE HAND MOVES FORWARD, THE TRAGEDY BEGINS5

HAS ANYONE AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY A CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT POETS OF STRONG AGES HAVE CALLED INSPIRATION? IF NOT, I WILL DESCRIBE IT.‚ÄÎIF ONE HAD THE SLIGHTEST RESIDUE OF SUPERSTITION LEFT IN ONE‚ÄÔS SYSTEM, ONE COULD HARDLY REJECT ALTOGETHER THE IDEA THAT ONE IS MERELY INCARNATION, MERELY MOUTHPIECE, MERELY A MEDIUM OF OVERPOWERING FORCES. THE CONCEPT OF REVELATION‚ÄÎIN THE SENSE THAT SUDDENLY, WITH INDESCRIBABLE CERTAINTY AND SUBTLETY, SOMETHING BECOMES VISIBLE, AUDIBLE, SOMETHING THAT SHAKES ONE TO THE LAST DEPTHS AND THROWS ONE DOWN‚ÄÎTHAT MERELY DESCRIBES THE FACTS. ONE HEARS, ONE DOES NOT SEEK; ONE ACCEPTS, ONE DOES NOT ASK WHO GIVES; LIKE LIGHTNING, A THOUGHT FLASHES UP, WITH NECESSITY, WITHOUT HESITATION REGARDING ITS FORM‚ÄÎI NEVER HAD ANY CHOICE.

A RAPTURE WHOSE TREMENDOUS TENSION OCCASIONALLY DISCHARGES ITSELF IN A FLOOD OF TEARS‚ÄÎNOW THE PACE QUICKENS INVOLUNTARILY, NOW IT BECOMES SLOW; ONE IS ALTOGETHER BESIDE ONESELF, WITH THE DISTINCT CONSCIOUSNESS OF SUBTLE SHUDDERS AND OF ONE‚ÄÔS SKIN CREEPING1 DOWN TO ONE‚ÄÔS TOES; A DEPTH OF HAPPINESS IN WHICH EVEN WHAT IS MOST PAINFUL AND GLOOMY DOES NOT SEEM SOMETHING OPPOSITE BUT RATHER CONDITIONED, PROVOKED, A NECESSARY COLOR IN SUCH A SUPERABUNDANCE OF LIGHT; AN INSTINCT FOR RHYTHMIC RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARCHES OVER WIDE SPACES OF FORMS‚ÄÎLENGTH, THE NEED FOR A RHYTHM WITH WIDE ARCHES,2 IS ALMOST THE MEASURE OF THE FORCE OF INSPIRATION, A KIND OF COMPENSATION FOR ITS PRESSURE AND TENSION.

EVERYTHING HAPPENS INVOLUNTARILY IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE BUT AS IN A GALE OF A FEELING OF FREEDOM, OF ABSOLUTENESS, OF POWER, OF DIVINITY.‚ÄÎTHE INVOLUNTARINESS OF IMAGE AND METAPHOR IS STRANGEST OF ALL; ONE NO LONGER HAS ANY NOTION OF WHAT IS AN IMAGE OR A METAPHOR: EVERYTHING OFFERS ITSELF AS THE NEAREST, MOST OBVIOUS, SIMPLEST EXPRESSION. IT ACTUALLY SEEMS, TO ALLUDE TO SOMETHING ZARATHUSTRA SAYS, AS IF THE THINGS THEMSELVES APPROACHED AND OFFERED THEMSELVES AS METAPHORS (‚ÄÚHERE ALL THINGS COME CARESSINGLY TO YOUR DISCOURSE AND FLATTER YOU; FOR THEY WANT TO RIDE ON YOUR BACK. ON EVERY METAPHOR YOU RIDE TO EVERY TRUTH‚Ä¶. HERE THE WORDS AND WORD-SHRINES OF ALL BEING OPEN UP BEFORE YOU; HERE ALL BEING WISHES TO BECOME WORD, ALL BECOMING WISHES TO LEARN FROM YOU HOW TO SPEAK‚ÄÙ)-3

THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE OF INSPIRATION; I DO NOT DOUBT THAT ONE HAS TO GO BACK THOUSANDS OF YEARS IN ORDER TO FIND ANYONE WHO COULD SAY TO ME, ‚ÄÚIT IS MINE AS WELL.‚ÄÙ4

AFTERWARDS I WAS SICK FOR A FEW WEEKS IN GENOA. THEN CAME A MELANCHOLY SPRING IN ROME WHERE I PUT UP WITH LIFE‚ÄÎIT WAS NOT EASY. FUNDAMENTALLY, THIS MOST INDECENT PLACE ON EARTH FOR THE POET OF ZARATHUSTRA DISTRESSED ME EXCEEDINGLY, AND I HAD NOT CHOSEN IT VOLUNTARILY. I WANTED TO GO TO AQUILA,1 ROME‚ÄÔS COUNTERCONCEPT, FOUNDED FROM HOSTILITY AGAINST ROME, AS I SHALL ONE DAY FOUND A PLACE, IN2 MEMORY OF AN ATHEIST AND ENEMY OF THE CHURCH COMME IL FAUT3 ONE OF THOSE MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO ME, THE GREAT HOHENSTAUFEN EMPEROR FREDERICK II.4 BUT SOME FATALITY WAS AT WORK: I HAD TO GO BACK AGAIN.5 IN THE END I RESIGNED MYSELF TO THE PIAZZA BARBERINI, AFTER MY EXERTIONS TO GO TO AN ANTI-CHRISTIAN ENVIRONMENT HAD WEARIED ME. I FEAR THAT IN ORDER TO AVOID BAD ODORS AS FAR AS POSSIBLE I ONCE INQUIRED AT THE PALAZZO DEL QUIRINALE ITSELF6 WHETHER THEY DID NOT HAVE A QUIET ROOM FOR A PHILOSOPHER.

IT WAS ON A LOGGIA HIGH ABOVE THAT PIAZZA, FROM WHICH ONE HAS A FINE VIEW OF ROME AND HEARS THE FONTANA SPLASHING FAR BELOW, THAT THE LONELIEST SONG WAS WRITTEN THAT HAS EVER BEEN WRITTEN, THE ‚ÄÚNIGHT SONG.‚ÄÙ7 AROUND THAT TIME A MELODY OF INDESCRIBABLE MELANCHOLY WAS ALWAYS ABOUT ME, AND I FOUND ITS REFRAIN IN THE WORDS, ‚ÄÚDEAD FROM IMMORTALITY.‚ÄÙ

THAT SUMMER, BACK HOME AT THE HOLY SPOT WHERE THE FIRST LIGHTNING OF THE ZARATHUSTRA IDEA HAD FLASHED FOR ME, I FOUND ZARATHUSTRA II. TEN DAYS SUFFICED; IN NO CASE, NEITHER FOR THE FIRST NOR FOR THE THIRD AND LAST,8 DID I REQUIRE MORE. THE NEXT WINTER, UNDER THE HALCYON SKY OF NIZZA, WHICH THEN SHONE INTO MY LIFE FOR THE FIRST TIME, I FOUND ZARATHUSTRA III‚ÄÎAND WAS FINISHED. SCARCELY A YEAR FOR THE WHOLE OF IT.

MANY CONCEALED SPOTS AND HEIGHTS IN THE LANDSCAPE AROUND NIZZA ARE HALLOWED FOR ME BY UNFORGETTABLE MOMENTS; THAT DECISIVE PASSAGE WHICH BEARS THE TITLE ‚ÄÚON OLD AND NEW TABLETS‚ÄÙ9 WAS COMPOSED ON THE MOST ONEROUS ASCENT FROM THE STATION TO THE MARVELOUS MOORISH EYRIE, EZA‚ÄÎTHE SUPPLENESS OF MY MUSCLES HAS ALWAYS BEEN GREATEST WHEN MY CREATIVE ENERGIES WERE FLOWING MOST ABUNDANTLY. THE BODY IS INSPIRED; LET US KEEP THE ‚ÄÚSOUL‚ÄÙ OUT OF IT.‚ÄÎOFTEN ONE COULD HAVE SEEN ME DANCE; IN THOSE DAYS I COULD WALK IN THE MOUNTAINS FOR SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS WITHOUT A TRACE OF WEARINESS. I SLEPT WELL, I LAUGHED MUCH‚ÄÎMY VIGOR AND PATIENCE WERE PERFECT.





5


EXCEPT FOR THESE TEN-DAY WORKS, THE YEARS DURING AND ABOVE ALL AFTER MY ZARATHUSTRA WERE MARKED BY DISTRESS WITHOUT EQUAL. ONE PAYS DEARLY FOR IMMORTALITY: ONE HAS TO DIE SEVERAL TIMES WHILE STILL ALIVE.

THERE IS SOMETHING I CALL THE RANCUNE1 OF WHAT IS GREAT: EVERYTHING GREAT‚ÄÎA WORK, A DEED‚ÄÎIS NO SOONER ACCOMPLISHED THAN IT TURNS AGAINST THE MAN WHO DID IT. BY DOING IT, HE HAS BECOME WEAK; HE NO LONGER ENDURES HIS DEED, HE CAN NO LONGER FACE IT. SOMETHING ONE WAS NEVER PERMITTED TO WILL LIES BEHIND ONE, SOMETHING IN WHICH THE KNOT IN THE DESTINY OF HUMANITY IS TIED‚ÄÎAND NOW ONE LABORS UNDER IT!‚ÄÎIT ALMOST CRUSHES ONE.‚ÄÎTHE RANCUNE OF WHAT IS GREAT.

THEN THERE IS THE GRUESOME SILENCE ONE HEARS ALL AROUND ONE. SOLITUDE HAS SEVEN SKINS; NOTHING PENETRATES THEM ANY MORE. ONE COMES TO MEN, ONE GREETS FRIENDS‚ÄÎMORE DESOLATION, NO EYE OFFERS A GREETING. AT BEST, A KIND OF REVOLT. SUCH REVOLTS I EXPERIENCED, VERY DIFFERENT IN DEGREE BUT FROM ALMOST EVERYBODY WHO WAS CLOSE TO ME. IT SEEMS NOTHING OFFENDS MORE DEEPLY THAN SUDDENLY LETTING OTHERS FEEL A DISTANCE;2 THOSE NOBLE NATURES WHO DO NOT KNOW HOW TO LIVE WITHOUT REVERENCE ARE RARE.

THIRDLY, THERE IS THE ABSUTD SENSITIVITY OF THE SKIN TO SMALL STINGS, A KIND OF HELPLESSNESS AGAINST EVERYTHING SMALL.3 THIS SEEMS TO ME TO BE DUE TO THE TREMENDOUS SQUANDERING OF ALL DEFENSIVE ENERGIES WHICH IS A PRESUPPOSITION OF EVERY CREATIVE DEED, EVERY DEED THAT ISSUES FROM ONE‚ÄÔS MOST AUTHENTIC, INMOST, NETHERMOST REGIONS. OUR SMALL DEFENSIVE CAPACITIES ARE THUS, AS IT WERE, SUSPENDED; NO ENERGY IS LEFT FOR THEM.

I STILL DARE TO HINT THAT ONE DIGESTS LESS WELL, DOES NOT LIKE TO MOVE, IS ALL TOO SUSCEPTIBLE TO FEELING CHILLS AS WELL AS MISTRUST‚ÄÎMISTRUST THAT IS IN MANY INSTANCES MERELY AN ETIOLOGICAL BLUNDER. IN SUCH A STATE I ONCE SENSED THE PROXIMITY OF A HERD OF COWS EVEN BEFORE I SAW IT, MERELY BECAUSE MILDER AND MORE PHILANTHROPIC THOUGHTS CAME BACK TO ME: THEY HAD WARMTH.

THIS WORK STANDS ALTOGETHER APART. LEAVING ASIDE THE POETS: PERHAPS NOTHING HAS EVER BEEN DONE FROM AN EQUAL EXCESS OF STRENGTH. MY CONCEPT OF THE ‚ÄÚDIONYSIAN‚ÄÙ HERE BECAME A SUPREME DEED; MEASURED AGAINST THAT, ALL THE REST OF HUMAN ACTIVITY SEEMS POOR AND RELATIVE. THAT A GOETHE, A SHAKESPEARE, WOULD BE UNABLE TO BREATHE EVEN FOR A MOMENT IN THIS TREMENDOUS PASSION AND HEIGHT, THAT DANTE IS, COMPARED WITH ZARATHUSTRA, MERELY A BELIEVER AND NOT ONE WHO FIRST CREATES TRUTH, A WORLD-GOVERNING SPIRIT, A DESTINY‚ÄÎTHAT THE POETS OF THE VEDA ARE PRIESTS AND NOT EVEN WORTHY OF TYING THE SHOELACES OF A ZARATHUSTRA‚ÄÎTHAT IS THE LEAST THING AND GIVES NO IDEA OF THE DISTANCE, OF THE AZURE SOLITUDE IN WHICH THIS WORK LIVES. ZARATHUSTRA POSSESSES AN ETERNAL RIGHT TO SAY: ‚ÄÚI DRAW CIRCLES AROUND ME AND SACRED BOUNDARIES; FEWER AND FEWER MEN CLIMB WITH ME ON EVER HIGHER MOUNTAINS: I AM BUILDING A MOUNTAIN RANGE OUT OF EVER MORE SACRED MOUNTAINS.‚ÄÙ1

LET ANYONE ADD UP THE SPIRIT AND GOOD NATURE OF ALL GREAT SOULS:2 ALL OF THEM TOGETHER WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING EVEN ONE OF ZARATHUSTRA‚ÄÔS DISCOURSES. THE LADDER ON WHICH HE ASCENDS AND DESCENDS3 IS TREMENDOUS; HE HAS SEEN FURTHER, WILLED FURTHER, BEEN CAPABLE FURTHER THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING. IN EVERY WORD HE CONTRADICTS, THIS MOST YES-SAYING OF ALL SPIRITS; IN HIM ALL OPPOSITES ARE BLENDED INTO A NEW UNITY. THE HIGHEST AND THE LOWEST ENERGIES OF HUMAN NATURE, WHAT IS SWEETEST, MOST FRIVOLOUS, AND MOST TERRIBLE WELLS FORTH FROM ONE FOUNT WITH IMMORTAL ASSURANCE. TILL THEN ONE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT IS HEIGHT, WHAT DEPTH; ONE KNOWS EVEN LESS WHAT TRUTH IS. THERE IS NO MOMENT IN THIS REVELATION OF TRUTH THAT HAS BEEN ANTICIPATED OR GUESSED BY EVEN ONE OF THE GREATEST. THERE IS NO WISDOM, NO INVESTIGATION OF THE SOUL, NO ART OF SPEECH BEFORE ZARATHUSTRA; WHAT IS NEAREST AND MOST EVERYDAY, HERE SPEAKS OF UNHEARD-OF THINGS. EPIGRAMS TREMBLING WITH PASSION, ELOQUENCE BECOME MUSIC, LIGHTNING BOLTS HURLED FORWARD INTO HITHERTO UNFATHOMED FUTURES. THE MOST POWERFUL CAPACITY FOR METAPHORS THAT HAS EXISTED SO FAR IS POOR AND MERE CHILD‚ÄÔS PLAY COMPARED WITH THIS RETURN OF LANGUAGE TO THE NATURE OF IMAGERY.

AND HOW ZARATHUSTRA DESCENDS AND SAYS TO EVERYONE WHAT IS MOST GOOD-NATURED! HOW GENTLY HE HANDLES EVEN HIS ANTAGONISTS, THE PRIESTS, AND SUFFERS OF THEM WITH THEM!‚ÄÎHERE MAN HAS BEEN OVERCOME AT EVERY MOMENT; THE CONCEPT OF THE ‚ÄÚOVERMAN‚ÄÙ HAS HERE BECOME THE GREATEST REALITY‚ÄÎWHATEVER WAS SO FAR CONSIDERED GREAT IN MAN LIES BENEATH HIM AT AN INFINITE DISTANCE. THE HALCYON, THE LIGHT FEET, THE OMNIPRESENCE OF MALICE AND EXUBERANCE, AND WHATEVER ELSE IS TYPICAL OF THE TYPE OF ZARATHUSTRA‚ÄÎNONE OF THIS HAS EVER BEFORE BEEN DREAMED OF AS ESSENTIAL TO GREATNESS. PRECISELY IN THIS WIDTH OF SPACE AND THIS ACCESSIBILITY FOR WHAT IS CONTRADICTORY, ZARATHUSTRA EXPERIENCES HIMSELF AS THE SUPREME TYPE OF ALL BEINGS; AND ONCE ONE HEARS HOW HE DEFINES THIS, ONE WILL REFRAIN FROM SEEKING ANY METAPHOR FOR IT.4

‚ÄÚTHE SOUL THAT HAS THE LONGEST LADDER AND REACHES DOWN DEEPEST‚ÄÎTHE MOST COMPREHENSIVE SOUL, WHICH CAN RUN AND STRAY AND ROAM FARTHEST WITHIN ITSELF; THE MOST NECESSARY SOUL THAT PLUNGES JOYOUSLY INTO CHANCE; THE SOUL THAT, HAVING BEING, DIVES INTO BECOMING; THE SOUL THAT HAS, BUT WANTS TO WANT AND WILL; THE SOUL THAT FLEES ITSELF AND CATCHES UP WITH ITSELF IN THE WIDEST CIRCLES; THE WISEST SOUL THAT FOLLY EXHORTS MOST SWEETLY; THE SOUL THAT LOVES ITSELF MOST, IN WHICH ALL THINGS HAVE THEIR SWEEP AND COUNTERSWEEP AND EBB AND FLOOD‚ÄÎ‚ÄÙ5

BUT THAT IS THE CONCEPT OF DIONYSUS HIMSELF.‚ÄÎANOTHER CONSIDERATION LEADS TO THE VERY SAME RESULT. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM IN THE TYPE OF ZARATHUSTRA IS HOW HE THAT SAYS NO AND DOES NO TO AN UNHEARD-OF DEGREE, TO EVERYTHING TO WHICH ONE HAS SO FAR SAID YES, CAN NEVERTHELESS BE THE OPPOSITE OF A NO-SAYING SPIRIT; HOW THE SPIRIT WHO BEARS THE HEAVIEST FATE, A FATALITY OF A TASK, CAN NEVERTHELESS BE THE LIGHTEST AND MOST TRANSCENDENT‚ÄÎZARATHUSTRA IS A DANCER‚ÄÎHOW HE THAT HAS THE HARDEST, MOST TERRIBLE INSIGHT INTO REALITY, THAT HAS THOUGHT THE ‚ÄÚMOST ABYSMAL IDEA,‚ÄÙ NEVERTHELESS DOES NOT CONSIDER IT AN OBJECTION TO EXISTENCE, NOT EVEN TO ITS ETERNAL RECURRENCE‚ÄÎBUT RATHER ONE REASON MORE FOR BEING HIMSELF THE ETERNAL YES TO ALL THINGS, ‚ÄÚTHE TREMENDOUS, UNBOUNDED SAYING YES AND AMEN.‚ÄÙ6‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚINTO ALL ABYSSES I STILL CARRY THE BLESSINGS OF MY SAYING YES.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎBUT THIS IS THE CONCEPT OF DIONYSUS ONCE AGAIN.





7


WHAT LANGUAGE WILL SUCH A SPIRIT SPEAK WHEN HE SPEAKS TO HIMSELF? THE LANGUAGE OF THE DITHYRAMB. I AM THE INVENTOR OF THE DITHYRAMB. LISTEN TO HOW ZARATHUSTRA SPEAKS TO HIMSELF BEFORE SUNRISE: SUCH EMERALD HAPPINESS, SUCH DIVINE TENDERNESS DID NOT HAVE A TONGUE BEFORE ME. EVEN THE DEEPEST MELANCHOLY OF SUCH A DIONYSUS STILL TURNS INTO A DITHYRAMB. TO GIVE SOME INDICATION OF THIS, I CHOOSE THE ‚ÄÚNIGHT SONG,‚ÄÙ THE IMMORTAL LAMENT AT BEING CONDEMNED BY THE OVERABUNDANCE OF LIGHT AND POWER, BY HIS SUN-NATURE, NOT TO LOVE.

NIGHT HAS COME; NOW ALL FOUNTAINS SPEAK MORE LOUDLY. AND MY SOUL, TOO, IS A FOUNTAIN.

NIGHT HAS COME; ONLY NOW ALL THE SONGS OF LOVERS AWAKEN. AND MY SOUL, TOO, IS THE SONG OF A LOVER.

SOMETHING UNSTILLED, UNSUITABLE IS WITHIN ME; IT WANTS TO BE VOICED. A CRAVING FOR LOVE IS WITHIN ME; IT SPEAKS THE LANGUAGE OF LOVE.

LIGHT AM I; AH, THAT I WERE NIGHT! BUT THIS IS MY LONELINESS THAT I AM GIRT WITH LIGHT. AH, THAT I WERE DARK AND NOCTURNAL! HOW I WOULD SUCK AT THE BREASTS OF LIGHT! AND EVEN YOU WOULD I BLESS, YOU LITTLE SPARKLING STARS AND GLOWWORMS UP THERE, AND BE OVERJOYED WITH YOUR GIFTS OF LIGHT.

BUT I LIVE IN MY OWN LIGHT; I DRINK BACK INTO MYSELF THE FLAMES THAT BREAK OUT OF ME. I DO NOT KNOW THE HAPPINESS OF THOSE WHO RECEIVE; AND I HAVE OFTEN DREAMED THAT EVEN STEALING MUST BE MORE BLESSED THAN RECEIVING. THIS IS MY POVERTY, THAT MY HAND NEVER RESTS FROM GIVING; THIS IS MY ENVY, THAT I SEE WAITING EYES AND THE LIT-UP NIGHTS OF LONGING. OH, WRETCHEDNESS OF ALL GIVERS! OH, DARKENING OF MY SUN! OH, CRAVING TO CRAVE! OH, RAVENOUS HUNGER IN SATIATION!

THEY RECEIVE FROM ME, BUT DO I TOUCH THEIR SOULS? THERE IS A CLEFT BETWEEN GIVING AND RECEIVING; AND THE NARROWEST CLEFT IS THE LAST TO BE BRIDGED. A HUNGER GROWS OUT OF MY BEAUTY: I SHOULD LIKE TO HURT THOSE FOR WHOM I SHINE; I SHOULD LIKE TO ROB THOSE TO WHOM I GIVE; THUS DO I HUNGER FOR MALICE. TO WITHDRAW MY HAND WHEN THE OTHER HAND ALREADY REACHES OUT TO IT; TO LINGER LIKE THE WATERFALL, WHICH LINGERS EVEN WHILE IT PLUNGES: THUS DO I HUNGER FOR MALICE. SUCH REVENGE MY FULLNESS PLOTS: SUCH SPITE WELLS UP OUT OF MY LONELINESS. MY HAPPINESS IN GIVING DIED IN GIVING; MY VIRTUE TIRED OF ITSELF IN ITS OVERFLOW.

THE DANGER OF THOSE WHO ALWAYS GIVE IS THAT THEY LOSE THEIR SENSE OF SHAME; AND THE HEART AND HAND OF THOSE WHO ALWAYS METE OUT BECOME CALLOUS FROM ALWAYS METING OUT. MY EYE NO LONGER WELLS OVER AT THE SHAME OF THOSE WHO BEG; MY HAND HAS GROWN TOO HARD FOR THE TREMBLING OF FILLED HANDS. WHERE HAVE THE TEARS OF MY EYES GONE AND THE DOWN OF MY HEART? OH, THE LONELINESS OF ALL GIVERS! OH, THE TACITURNITY OF ALL WHO SHINE!

MANY SUNS REVOLVE IN THE VOID: TO ALL THAT IS DARK THEY SPEAK WITH THEIR LIGHT‚ÄÎTO ME THEY ARE SILENT. OH, THIS IS THE ENMITY OF THE LIGHT AGAINST WHAT SHINES: MERCILESS IT MOVES IN ITS ORBIT. UNJUST IN ITS HEART AGAINST ALL THAT SHINES, COLD AGAINST SUNS‚ÄÎTHUS MOVES EVERY SUN.

THE SUNS FLY LIKE A STORM IN THEIR ORBITS: THAT IS THEIR MOTION. THEY FOLLOW THEIR INEXORABLE WILL: THAT IS THEIR COLDNESS.

OH, IT IS ONLY YOU, YOU DARK ONES, YOU NOCTURNAL ONES, WHO CREATE WARMTH OUT OF THAT WHICH SHINES. IT IS ONLY YOU WHO DRINK MILK AND REFRESHMENT OUT OF THE UDDERS OF LIGHT.

ALAS, ICE IS ALL AROUND ME, MY HAND IS BURNED BY THE ICE. ALAS, THIRST IS WITHIN ME THAT LANGUISHES AFTER YOUR THIRST.

NIGHT HAS COME: ALAS, THAT I MUST BE LIGHT! AND THIRST FOR THE NOCTURNAL! AND LONELINESS!

NIGHT HAS COME: NOW MY CRAVING BREAKS OUT OF ME LIKE A WELL; TO SPEAK I CRAVE.

NIGHT HAS COME; NOW ALL FOUNTAINS SPEAK MORE LOUDLY. AND MY SOUL, TOO, IS A FOUNTAIN.

NIGHT HAS COME; NOW ALL THE SONGS OF LOVERS AWAKEN. AND MY SOUL, TOO, IS THE SONG OF A LOVER.

NOTHING LIKE THIS HAS EVER BEEN WRITTEN, FELT, OR SUFFERED: THUS SUFFERS A GOD, A DIONYSUS. THE ANSWER TO SUCH A DITHYRAMB OF SOLAR SOLITUDE IN THE LIGHT WOULD BE ARIADNE.‚ÄÎWHO BESIDES ME KNOWS WHAT ARIADNE IS!‚ÄÎFOR ALL SUCH RIDDLES NOBODY SO FAR HAD ANY SOLUTION; I DOUBT THAT ANYBODY EVEN SAW ANY RIDDLES HERE.

ZARATHUSTRA ONCE DEFINES, QUITE STRICTLY, HIS TASK‚ÄÎIT IS MINE, TOO‚ÄÎAND THERE IS NO MISTAKING HIS MEANING: HE SAYS YES TO THE POINT OF JUSTIFYING, OF REDEEMING EVEN ALL OF THE PAST.

‚ÄÚI WALK AMONG MEN AS AMONG THE FRAGMENTS OF THE FUTURE‚ÄÎTHAT FUTURE WHICH I ENVISAGE. AND THIS IS ALL MY CREATING AND STRIVING, THAT I CREATE AND CARRY TOGETHER INTO ONE WHAT IS FRAGMENT AND RIDDLE AND DREADFUL ACCIDENT. AND HOW COULD I BEAR TO BE A MAN IF MAN WERE NOT ALSO A CREATOR AND GUESSER OF RIDDLES AND REDEEMER OF ACCIDENTS? TO REDEEM THOSE WHO LIVED IN THE PAST AND TO TURN EVERY ‚ÄÒIT WAS‚ÄÔ INTO A ‚ÄÒTHUS I WILLED IT‚ÄÔ‚ÄÎTHAT ALONE SHOULD I CALL REDEMPTION.‚ÄÙ1

IN ANOTHER PASSAGE HE DEFINES AS STRICTLY AS POSSIBLE WHAT ALONE ‚ÄÚMAN‚ÄÙ CAN BE FOR HIM‚ÄÎNOT AN OBJECT OF LOVE OR, WORSE, PITY‚ÄÎZARATHUSTRA HAS MASTERED THE GREAT NAUSEA OVER MAN, TOO: MAN IS FOR HIM AN UN-FORM, A MATERIAL, AN UGLY STONE THAT NEEDS A SCULPTOR.

‚ÄÒWILLING NO MORE AND ESTEEMING NO MORE AND CREATING NO MORE‚ÄÎOH, THAT THIS GREAT WEARINESS MIGHT ALWAYS REMAIN FAR FROM ME! IN KNOWLEDGE, TOO, I FEEL ONLY MY WILL‚ÄÔS JOY IN BEGETTING AND BECOMING; AND IF THERE IS INNOCENCE IN MY KNOWLEDGE, IT IS BECAUSE THE WILL TO BEGET IS IN IT. AWAY FROM GOD AND GODS THIS WILL HAS LURED ME; WHAT COULD ONE CREATE IF GODS‚ÄÎWERE THERE?

‚ÄÚBUT MY FERVENT WILL TO CREATE IMPELS ME EVER AGAIN TOWARD MAN; THUS IS THE HAMMER IMPELLED TOWARD THE STONE. O MEN, IN THE STONE AN IMAGE IS SLEEPING, THE IMAGE OF IMAGES! ALAS, THAT IT HAS TO SLEEP IN THE HARDEST, UGLIEST STONE! NOW MY HAMMER RAGES CRUELLY AGAINST ITS PRISON. PIECES OF ROCK RAIN FROM THE STONE: WHAT IS THAT TO ME? I WANT TO PERFECT IT; FOR A SHADOW CAME TO ME‚ÄÎTHE STILLEST AND LIGHTEST OF ALL THINGS ONCE CAME TO ME. THE BEAUTY OF THE OVER-MAN CAME TO ME AS A SHADOW. O MY BROTHERS, WHAT ARE GODS TO ME NOW?‚ÄÙ2

I STRESS A FINAL POINT: THE VERSE IN ITALICS FURNISHES THE OCCASION. AMONG THE CONDITIONS FOR A DIONYSIAN TASK ARE, IN A DECISIVE WAY, THE HARDNESS OF THE HAMMER, THE JOY EVEN IN DESTROYING. THE IMPERATIVE, ‚ÄÚBECOME HARD!‚ÄÙ THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL CERTAINTY THAT ALL CREATORS ARE HARD,3 IS THE DISTINCTIVE MARK OF A DIONYSIAN NATURE.


1CLEARLY, THE ROCK IS NOT THE ONE ON THE CHASTE, A PENINSULA IN THE SILSER SEE, ON WHICH A TABLET WITH THE TEXT OF THE ‚ÄÚDRUNKEN SONG‚ÄÙ FROM ZARATHUSTRA IV (SECTION 12) HAS BEEN FASTENED. A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE RIGHT ROCK ILLUSTRATES A SMALL BOOKLET OF 44 PAGES PUT OUT BY AND ENTITLED NIETZSCHE-HAUS IN SILS-MARIA.

WHEN THE FIRST EMPEROR OF THE SECOND REICH, WILHELM I, HAD DIED AT NINETY-ONE ON MARCH 9, 1888, HIS MUCH MORE LIBERAL SON, FRIEDRICH III, HAD SUCCEEDED HIM; BUT FRIEDRICH DIED OF CANCER AFTER A HUNDRED DAYS; JUNE 15, AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON, THE LAST GERMAN KAISER, WILHELM II. IT HAS OFTEN BEEN SURMISED THAT EUROPEAN HISTORY MIGHT HAVE TAKEN A DIFFERENT TURN IF FRIEDRICH III HAD LIVED LONGER.

ON JUNE 20 NIETZSCHE HAD WRITTEN GAST: ‚ÄÚTHE DEATH OF KAISER FRIED-RICH HAS MOVED ME: IN THE END HE WAS A SMALL GLIMMERING LIGHT OF FREE THOUGHT, THE LAST HOPE FOR GERMANY. NOW THE RULE OF STOCKER BEGINS: I PROJECT THE CONSEQUENCE AND ALREADY KNOW THAT NOW MY WILL TO POWER WILL BE CONFISCATED IN GERMANY FIRST OF ALL.‚ÄÙ

HOFPREDIGER (COURT CHAPLAIN) STOCKER WAS THE LEADING GERMAN ANTI-SEMITE OF THAT PERIOD. THE WILL TO POWER WAS THEN NO MORE THAN A PROJECT FOR WHICH NIEZSCHE HAD ACCUMULATED A GREAT DEAL OF MATERIAL, AND THE WORK NOW KNOWN UNDER THIS STRIKING TITLE IS MERELY A POSTHUMOUSLY PUBLISHED COLLECTION OF MANY OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS MOST INTERESTING NOTES. STILL, THIS LETTER SHOWS‚ÄÎALONG WITH A LOT OF OTHER EVIDENCE‚ÄÎHOW THE TITLE WAS NOT MEANT, AND HOW THOROUGHLY NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS INTENTIONS AND SPIRIT DIFFERED FROM THOSE OF THE LAST KAISER.

THE TASK FOR THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED NOW WAS INDICATED AS CLEARLY AS POSSIBLE. AFTER THE YES-SAYING PART OF MY TASK HAD BEEN SOLVED, THE TURN HAD COME FOR THE NO-SAYING, NO-DOING PART: THE REVALUATION OF OUR VALUES SO FAR, THE GREAT WAR‚ÄÎCONJURING UP A DAY OF DECISION. THIS INCLUDED THE SLOW SEARCH FOR THOSE RELATED TO ME, THOSE WHO, PROMPTED BY STRENGTH, WOULD OFFER ME THEIR HANDS FOR DESTROYING.

FROM THIS MOMENT FORWARD ALL MY WRITINGS ARE FISH HOOKS: PERHAPS I KNOW HOW TO FISH AS WELL AS ANYONE?‚ÄÎIF NOTHING WAS CAUGHT, I AM NOT TO BLAME. THERE WERE NO FISH.

THIS BOOK (1886) IS IN ALL ESSENTIALS A CRITIQUE OF MODERNITY, NOT EXCLUDING THE MODERN SCIENCES, MODERN ARTS, AND EVEN MODERN POLITICS, ALONG WITH POINTERS TO A CONTRARY TYPE THAT IS AS LITTLE MODERN AS POSSIBLE‚ÄÎA NOBLE, YES-SAYING TYPE. IN THE LATTER SENSE, THE BOOK IS A SCHOOL FOR THE GENTILHOMME,1 TAKING THIS CONCEPT IN A MORE SPIRITUAL AND RADICAL SENSE THAN HAS EVER BEEN DONE. ONE HAS TO HAVE GUTS MERELY TO ENDURE IT; ONE MUST NEVER HAVE LEARNED HOW TO BE AFRAID.

ALL THOSE THINGS OF WHICH OUR AGE IS PROUD ARE EXPERIENCED AS CONTRADICTIONS TO THIS TYPE, ALMOST AS BAD MANNERS; OUR FAMOUS ‚ÄÚOBJECTIVITY,‚ÄÙ FOR EXAMPLE; ‚ÄÚPITY FOR ALL THAT SUFFERS;‚ÄÙ THE ‚ÄÚHISTORICAL SENSE‚ÄÙ WITH ITS SUBMISSION TO FOREIGN TASTES, GROVELING ON ITS BELLY BEFORE PETITS FAITS,2 AND ‚ÄÚBEING SCIENTIFIC.‚ÄÙ

WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THIS BOOK FOLLOWED AFTER ZARATHUSTRA, YOU MAY PERHAPS ALSO GUESS THE DIETETIC REGIMEN TO WHICH IT OWES ITS ORIGIN. THE EYE THAT HAD BEEN SPOILED BY THE TREMENDOUS NEED FOR SEEING FAR‚ÄÎZARATHUSTRA IS EVEN MORE FAR-SIGHTED THAN THE TSAR‚ÄÎIS HERE FORCED TO FOCUS ON WHAT LIES NEAREST, THE AGE, THE AROUND-US. IN EVERY RESPECT, ABOVE ALL ALSO IN THE FORM, YOU WILL FIND THE SAME DELIBERATE TURNING AWAY FROM THE INSTINCTS THAT HAD MADE POSSIBLE A ZARATHUSTRA. THE REFINEMENT IN FORM, IN INTENTION, IN THE ART OF SILENCE IS IN THE FOREGROUND; PSYCHOLOGY IS PRACTICED WITH ADMITTED HARDNESS AND CRUELTY‚ÄÎTHE BOOK IS DEVOID OF ANY GOOD-NATURED WORD.

ALL THIS IS A RECUPERATION: WHO WOULD GUESS AFTER ALL WHAT SORT OF RECUPERATION SUCH A SQUANDERING OF GOOD-NATUREDNESS AS ZARATHUSTRA REPRESENTS MAKES NECESSARY?

THEOLOGICALLY SPEAKING‚ÄÎLISTEN CLOSELY, FOR I RARELY SPEAK AS A THEOLOGIAN‚ÄÎIT WAS GOD HIMSELF WHO AT THE END OF HIS DAYS‚ÄÔ WORK LAY DOWN AS A SERPENT UNDER THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE: THUS HE RECUPERATED FROM BEING GOD.‚ÄÎHE HAD MADE EVERYTHING TOO BEAUTIFUL.3‚ÄÎTHE DEVIL IS MERELY THE LEISURE OF GOD ON THAT SEVENTH DAY.

GENEALOGY OF MORALS

A POLEMIC


REGARDING EXPRESSION, INTENTION, AND THE ART OF SURPRISE, THE THREE INQUIRIES WHICH CONSTITUTE THIS GENEALOGY ARE PERHAPS UNCANNIER THAN ANYTHING ELSE WRITTEN SO FAR. DIONYSUS IS, AS IS KNOWN, ALSO THE GOD OF DARKNESS.

EVERY TIME A BEGINNING THAT IS CALCULATED TO MISLEAD: COOL, SCIENTIFIC, EVEN IRONIC, DELIBERATELY FOREGROUND, DELIBERATELY HOLDING OFF. GRADUALLY MORE UNREST; SPORADIC LIGHTNING; VERY DISAGREEABLE TRUTHS ARE HEARD GRUMBLING IN THE DISTANCE‚ÄÎUNTIL EVENTUALLY A TEMPO FEROCE IS ATTAINED IN WHICH EVERYTHING RUSHES AHEAD IN A TREMENDOUS TENSION. IN THE END, IN THE MIDST OF PERFECTLY GRUESOME DETONATIONS, A NEW TRUTH BECOMES VISIBLE EVERY TIME AMONG THICK CLOUDS.

THE TRUTH OF THE FIRST INQUIRY IS THE BIRTH OF CHRISTIANITY: THE BIRTH OF CHRISTIANITY OUT OF THE SPIRIT OF RESSENTIMENT, NOT, AS PEOPLE MAY BELIEVE, OUT OF THE ‚ÄÚSPIRIT‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎA COUNTERMOVEMENT BY ITS VERY NATURE, THE GREAT REBELLION AGAINST THE DOMINION OF NOBLE VALUES.

THE SECOND INQUIRY OFFERS THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE CONSCIENCE‚ÄÎWHICH IS NOT, AS PEOPLE MAY BELIEVE, ‚ÄÚTHE VOICE OF GOD IN MAN‚ÄÙ: IT IS THE INSTINCT OF CRUELTY THAT TURNS BACK AFTER IT CAN NO LONGER DISCHARGE ITSELF EXTERNALLY. CRUELTY IS HERE EXPOSED FOR THE FIRST TIME AS ONE OF THE MOST ANCIENT AND BASIC SUBSTRATA OF CULTURE THAT SIMPLY CANNOT BE IMAGINED AWAY.

THE THIRD INQUIRY OFFERS THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHENCE THE ASCETIC IDEAL, THE PRIESTS‚ÄÔ IDEAL, DERIVES ITS TREMENDOUS POWER ALTHOUGH IT IS THE HARMFUL IDEAL PAR EXCELLENCE, A WILL TO THE END, AN IDEAL OF DECADENCE. ANSWER: NOT, AS PEOPLE MAY BELIEVE, BECAUSE GOD IS AT WORK BEHIND THE PRIESTS BUT FAUTE DE MIEUX1‚ÄÎBECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY IDEAL SO FAR, BECAUSE IT HAD NO RIVAL. ‚ÄÚFOR MAN WOULD RATHER WILL EVEN NOTHINGNESS THAN NOT WILL.‚ÄÙ2‚ÄÎABOVE ALL, A COUNTERIDEAL WAS LACKING‚ÄÎUNTIL ZARATHUSTRA.

TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS

HOW ONE PHILOSOPHIZES WITH A HAMMER1





1


THIS ESSAY OF LESS THAN 150 PAGES,2 CHEERFUL AND OMINOUS IN TONE, A DEMON THAT LAUGHS‚ÄÎTHE WORK OF SO FEW DAYS THAT I HESITATE TO MENTION HOW MANY, IS AN EXCEPTION AMONG BOOKS: THERE IS NONE RICHER IN SUBSTANCE, MORE INDEPENDENT, MORE SUBVERSIVE3‚ÄÎMORE EVIL. IF YOU WANT A QUICK IDEA HOW BEFORE ME EVERYTHING STOOD ON ITS HEAD,4 BEGIN WITH THIS ESSAY. WHAT IS CALLED IDOL ON THE TITLE PAGE IS SIMPLY WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED TRUTH SO FAR. TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS‚ÄÎTHAT IS: THE OLD TRUTH IS APPROACHING ITS END.





2


THERE IS NO REALITY, NO ‚ÄÚIDEALITY‚ÄÙ THAT IS NOT TOUCHED IN THIS ESSAY (TOUCHED: WHAT A CAUTIOUS EUPHEMISM!). NOT ONLY ETERNAL IDOLS, ALSO THE YOUNGEST WHICH ARE THEREFORE FEEBLEST ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR AGE. ‚ÄÚMODERN IDEAS,‚ÄÙ FOR EXAMPLE. A GREAT WIND BLOWS AMONG THE TREES, AND EVERYWHERE FRUIT FALL DOWN‚ÄÎTRUTHS. THE SQUANDERING OF AN ALL-TOO-RICH AUTUMN: ONE STUMBLES OVER TRUTHS, ONE STEPS ON AND KILLS A FEW‚ÄÎTHERE ARE TOO MANY.

BUT WHAT WE GET HOLD OF IS NO LONGER ANYTHING QUESTIONABLE BUT RATHER DECISIONS. I AM THE FIRST TO HOLD IN MY HANDS THE MEASURE FOR ‚ÄÚTRUTHS;‚ÄÙ I AM THE FIRST WHO IS ABLE TO DECIDE. JUST AS IF A SECOND CONSCIOUSNESS HAD GROWN IN ME; JUST AS IF ‚ÄÚTHE WILL‚ÄÙ HAD KINDLED A LIGHT FOR ITSELF IN ME SO THAT IT MIGHT SEE THE INCLINED PLANE, THE ASKEW PATH5 ON WHICH IT WENT DOWN SO FAR.‚ÄÎTHE ASKEW PATH‚ÄÎPEOPLE CALLED IT THE WAY TO ‚ÄÚTRUTH.‚ÄÙ

IT IS ALL OVER WITH ALL ‚ÄÚDARKLING ASPIRATION;‚ÄÙ PRECISELY THE GOOD MAN WAS LEAST AWARE OF THE RIGHT WAY.6‚ÄÎ AND IN ALL SERIOUSNESS: NOBODY BEFORE ME KNEW THE RIGHT WAY, THE WAY UP; IT IS ONLY BEGINNING WITH ME THAT THERE ARE HOPES AGAIN, TASKS, WAYS THAT CAN BE PRESCRIBED FOR CULTURE‚ÄÎI AM HE THAT BRINGS THESE GLAD TIDINGS.‚ÄÎ AND THUS I AM ALSO A DESTINY.‚ÄÎ

IMMEDIATELY UPON FINISHING THIS WORK, WITHOUT LOSING EVEN ONE DAY, I ATTACKED THE TREMENDOUS TASK OF THE REVALUATION,1 WITH A SOVEREIGN FEELING OF PRIDE THAT WAS INCOMPARABLE, CERTAIN AT EVERY MOMENT OF MY IMMORTALITY, ENGRAVING SIGN UPON SIGN ON BRONZE TABLETS WITH THE SURENESS OF A DESTINY. THE PREFACE WAS WRITTEN ON SEPTEMBER 3, 1888: WHEN I STEPPED OUTDOORS THE MORNING AFTER, I SAW THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DAY THAT THE UPPER ENGADINE EVER SHOWED ME‚ÄÎTRANSPARENT, THE COLORS GLOWING, INCLUDING ALL OPPOSITES, EVERYTHING THAT LIES BETWEEN ICE AND SOUTH.

IT WAS ONLY ON SEPTEMBER 20 THAT I LEFT SILS MARIA, DETAINED BY FLOODS‚ÄÎIN THE END BY FAR THE ONLY GUEST OF THIS WONDERFUL PLACE ON WHICH MY GRATITUDE WANTS TO BESTOW AN IMMORTAL NAME. AFTER A JOURNEY WITH INCIDENTS, INCLUDING SOME DANGER TO MY LIFE IN COMO, WHICH WAS FLOODED‚ÄÎI GOT THERE ONLY LATE AT NIGHT‚ÄÎI REACHED TURIN ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE 21ST‚ÄÎMY PROVEN PLACE, MY RESIDENCE FROM NOW ON. I TOOK THE SAME APARTMENT I HAD OCCUPIED IN THE SPRING, VIA CARLO ALBERTO 6, FOURTH FLOOR, OPPOSITE THE IMPOSING PALAZZO CARIGNANO IN WHICH VITTORIO EMANUELE2 WAS BORN, WITH A VIEW OF THE PIAZZA CARLO ALBERTO AND OF THE HILLS BEYOND. WITHOUT HESITATION AND WITHOUT PERMITTING MYSELF TO BE DISTRACTED FOR A MOMENT, I WENT BACK TO WORK: ONLY THE FINAL QUARTER OF THE WORK REMAINED TO BE DONE. ON THE 30TH OF SEPTEMBER, GREAT VICTORY; SEVENTH DAY; THE LEISURE OF A GOD WALKING ALONG THE PO RIVER.3 ON THE SAME DAY I WROTE THE PREFACE FOR TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS:4 CORRECTING THE PRINTER‚ÄÔS PROOFS OF THAT BOOK HAD BEEN MY RECREATION IN SEPTEMBER.

NEVER HAVE I EXPERIENCED SUCH AN AUTUMN, NOR CONSIDERED ANYTHING OF THE SORT POSSIBLE ON EARTH‚ÄÎA CLAUDE LORRAIN5 PROJECTED INTO THE INFINITE, EVERY DAY OF THE SAME INDOMITABLE PERFECTION.


1FOR THE MEANING OF THIS FAMOUS PHRASE, SEE THE PREFACE TO THE BOOK: ‚ÄÚ‚Ä¶ NOT JUST IDOLS OF THE AGE, BUT ETERNAL IDOLS, WHICH ARE HERE TOUCHED WITH A HAMMER AS WITH A TUNING FORK: THERE ARE ‚Ä¶ NONE MORE HOLLOW.‚ÄÙ

5HERE SIX WORDS HAVE BEEN USED TO RENDER DIE SCHIEFE BAHN; IN THE NEXT SENTENCE, ONLY THREE WORDS. THE ORDINARY GERMAN READER WOULD ASSUME AT FIRST THAT AN INCLINED PLANE WAS MEANT; THEN, COMING TO THE SECOND OCCURRENCE OF SCHIEFE, EMPHASIZED BY NIETZSCHE, HE WOULD INTERPRET IT AS ASKEW, CROOKED.

4WHEN HE WROTE THE PREFACE HE STILL INTENDED TO CALL THE BOOK M√ºSSIGGANG EINES PSYCHOLOGEN (A PSYCHOLOGIST‚ÄÔS LEISURE). A LETTER FROM PETER GAST (CITED IN PORTABLE NIETZSCHE), ASKING FOR A LESS UNASSUMING TITLE, CHANGED NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS MIND. THE BOOK APPEARED WITH THE NEW TITLE IN JANUARY 1889, A FEW DAYS AFTER NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS COLLAPSE. THE CASE OF WAGNER, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAD APPEARED IN THE FALL OF 1888: WITH RESPECT TO THESE TWO BOOKS, NIETZSCHE DOES NOT ADHERE TO THE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. THE ANTICHRIST, WHICH IS NOT REVIEWED HERE BY NIETZSCHE, AND NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER, WHICH WAS COMPOSED AFTER ECCE HOMO, WERE FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1895.

THE CASE OF WAGNER

A MUSICIAN‚ÄÔS PROBLEM





1


TO DO JUSTICE TO THIS ESSAY, ONE HAS TO SUFFER OF THE FATE OF MUSIC AS OF AN OPEN WOUND.‚ÄÎOF WHAT DO I SUFFER WHEN I SUFFER OF THE FATE OF MUSIC? THAT MUSIC HAS BEEN DONE OUT OF ITS WORLD-TRANSFIGURING, YES-SAYING CHARACTER, SO THAT IT IS MUSIC OF DECADENCE AND NO LONGER THE FLUTE OF DIONYSUS.

ASSUMING, HOWEVER, THAT A READER EXPERIENCES THE CAUSE OF MUSIC IN THIS WAY AS HIS OWN CAUSE, AS THE HISTORY OF HIS OWN SUFFERINGS, HE WILL FIND THIS ESSAY FULL OF CONSIDERATION AND EXCEEDINGLY MILD. TO BE CHEERFUL IN SUCH CASES, GENIALLY MOCKING ONESELF, TOO‚ÄÎRIDENDO DICERE SEVERUM1 WHEN THE VERUM DICERE WOULD JUSTIFY ANY AMOUNT OF HARDNESS‚ÄÎIS HUMANITY ITSELF. DOES ANYONE REALLY DOUBT THAT I, AS THE OLD ARTILLERIST I AM,2 COULD EASILY BRING UP MY HEAVY GUNS AGAINST WAGNER?‚ÄÎEVERYTHING DECISIVE IN THIS MATTER I HELD BACK‚ÄÎI HAVE LOVED WAGNER.

ULTIMATELY, AN ATTACK ON A SUBTLER ‚ÄÚUNKNOWN ONE,‚ÄÙ WHOM NOBODY ELSE IS LIKELY TO GUESS, IS PART OF THE MEANING AND WAY OF MY TASK‚ÄÎOH, I CAN UNCOVER ‚ÄÚUNKNOWN ONES‚ÄÙ WHO ARE IN AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT CATEGORY FROM A CAGLIOSTRO3 OF MUSIC‚ÄÎEVEN MORE, TO BE SURE, AN ATTACK ON THE GERMAN NATION WHICH IS BECOMING EVER LAZIER AND MORE IMPOVERISHED IN ITS INSTINCTS, EVER MORE HONEST, AND WHICH CONTINUES WITH AN ENVIABLE APPETITE TO FEED ON OPPOSITES, GOBBLING DOWN WITHOUT ANY DIGESTIVE TROUBLES ‚ÄÚFAITH‚ÄÙ AS WELL AS SCIENTIFIC MANNERS,4 ‚ÄÚCHRISTIAN LOVE‚ÄÙ AS WELL AS ANTI-SEMITISM, THE WILL TO POWER (TO THE REICH) AS WELL AS THE √©VANGILE DES HUMBLES.5‚ÄÎSUCH A FAILURE TO TAKE SIDES AMONG OPPOSITES! SUCH NEUTRALITY AND ‚ÄÚSELFLESSNESS‚ÄÙ OF THE STOMACH! THIS SENSE OF JUSTICE OF THE GERMAN PALATE THAT FINDS ALL CAUSES JUST AND ACCORDS ALL EQUAL RIGHTS6‚ÄÎTHAT FINDS EVERYTHING TASTY.‚ÄÎBEYOND A DOUBT, THE GERMANS ARE IDEALISTS.

WHEN I VISITED GERMANY LAST, I FOUND THE GERMAN TASTE EXERTING ITSELF TO CONCEDE EQUAL RIGHTS TO WAGNER AND TO THE TRUMPETER OF S√§KKINGEN;7 I MYSELF WITNESSED HOW A LISZT SOCIETY WAS FOUNDED IN LEIPZIG, FOR THE CULTIVATION AND PROPAGATION OF INSIDIOUS8 CHURCH MUSIC, OSTENSIBLY IN HONOR OF ONE OF THE MOST GENUINE AND GERMAN MUSICIANS‚ÄÎGERMAN IN THE OLD SENSE OF THAT WORD, NO MERE REICHSDEUTSCHER‚ÄÎTHE OLD MASTER HEINRICH SCH√ºTZ.‚ÄÎBEYOND A DOUBT, THE GERMANS ARE IDEALISTS.9





2


BUT HERE NOTHING SHALL KEEP ME FROM BECOMING BLUNT AND TELLING THE GERMANS A FEW HARD TRUTHS: WHO ELSE WOULD DO IT?

I SPEAK OF THEIR INDECENCY IN HISTORICIS. NOT ONLY HAVE THE GERMAN HISTORIANS UTTERLY LOST THE GREAT PERSPECTIVE FOR THE COURSE AND THE VALUES OF CULTURE; NOR ARE THEY MERELY, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, BUFFOONS OF POLITICS (OR THE CHURCH)‚ÄÎBUT THEY HAVE ACTUALLY PROSCRIBED THIS GREAT PERSPECTIVE. ONE MUST FIRST BE ‚ÄÚGERMAN‚ÄÙ AND HAVE ‚ÄÚRACE,‚ÄÙ THEN ONE CAN DECIDE ABOUT ALL VALUES AND DISVALUES IN HISTORICIS‚ÄÎONE DETERMINES THEM.

‚ÄÚGERMAN‚ÄÙ HAS BECOME AN ARGUMENT, DEUTSCHLAND, DEUTSCHLAND √ºBER ALLES1 A PRINCIPLE; THE TEUTONS REPRESENT THE ‚ÄÚMORAL WORLD ORDER‚ÄÙ IN HISTORY‚ÄÎTHE CARRIERS OF FREEDOM VERSUS THE IMPERIUM ROMANUM, AND THE RESTORATION OF MORALITY AND THE ‚ÄÚCATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE‚ÄÙ2 VERSUS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.‚ÄÎTHERE IS NOW A HISTORIOGRAPHY THAT IS REICHSDEUTSCH; THERE IS EVEN, I FEAR, AN ANTI-SEMITIC ONE‚ÄÎTHERE IS A COURT HISTORIOGRAPHY, AND HERR VON TREITSCHKE IS NOT ASHAMED‚ÄÎ3

RECENTLY AN IDIOTIC4 JUDGMENT IN HISTORICIS, A PROPOSITION OF THE FORTUNATELY LATE AESTHETIC SWABIAN, VISCHER,5 WAS REPEATED IN ONE GERMAN NEWSPAPER AFTER ANOTHER, AS A ‚ÄÚTRUTH‚ÄÙ TO WHICH EVERY GERMAN HAS TO SAY YES: ‚ÄÚTHE RENAISSANCE AND THE REFORMATION‚ÄÎONLY THE TWO TOGETHER MAKE A WHOLE: THE AESTHETIC REBIRTH AND THE MORAL REBIRTH.‚ÄÙ

WHEN I READ SUCH SENTENCES, MY PATIENCE IS EXHAUSTED AND I FEEL THE ITCH, I EVEN CONSIDER IT A DUTY, TO TELL THE GERMANS FOR ONCE HOW MANY THINGS THEY HAVE ON THEIR CONSCIENCE BY NOW.6 ALL GREAT CRIMES AGAINST CULTURE FOR FOUR CENTURIES THEY HAVE ON THEIR CONSCIENCE.‚ÄÎ AND THE REASON IS ALWAYS THE SAME: THEIR INNERMOST COWARDICE BEFORE REALITY, WHICH IS ALSO COWARDICE BEFORE THE TRUTH; THEIR UNTRUTHFULNESS WHICH HAS BECOME INSTINCTIVE WITH THEM; THEIR ‚ÄÚIDEALISM.‚ÄÙ

THE GERMANS DID EUROPE OUT OF THE HARVEST, THE MEANING, OF THE LAST GREAT AGE, THE AGE OF THE RENAISSANCE, AT A MOMENT WHEN A HIGHER ORDER OF VALUES, THE NOBLE ONES, THOSE THAT SAY YES TO LIFE, THOSE THAT GUARANTEE THE FUTURE, HAD TRIUMPHED AT THE SEAT OF THE OPPOSITE VALUES, THOSE OF DECLINE‚ÄÎEVEN IN THE VERY INSTINCTS OF THOSE WHO WERE SITTING THERE. LUTHER, THIS CALAMITY OF A MONK, RESTORED THE CHURCH AND, WHAT IS A THOUSAND TIMES WORSE, CHRISTIANITY, AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN IT WAS VANQUISHED.‚ÄÎCHRISTIANITY, THIS DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIFE BECOME RELIGION!‚ÄÎLUTHER, AN IMPOSSIBLE MONK WHO, ON ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN ‚ÄÚIMPOSSIBILITY,‚ÄÙ ATTACKED THE CHURCH AND‚ÄÎCONSEQUENTLY‚ÄÎRESTORED IT.‚ÄÎTHE CATHOLICS WOULD HAVE GOOD REASONS TO CELEBRATE LUTHER FESTIVALS, TO WRITE LUTHER PLAYS.‚ÄÎLUTHER‚ÄÎAND THE ‚ÄÚMORAL REBIRTH‚ÄÙ! TO HELL WITH PSYCHOLOGY!7‚ÄÎBEYOND A DOUBT, THE GERMANS ARE IDEALISTS.

TWICE, WHEN AN HONEST, UNEQUIVOCAL, PERFECTLY SCIENTIFIC WAY OF THINKING HAD JUST BEEN ATTAINED WITH TREMENDOUS FORTITUDE AND SELF-OVERCOMING, THE GERMANS MANAGED TO FIND DEVIOUS PATHS TO THE OLD ‚ÄÚIDEAL,‚ÄÙ RECONCILIATIONS OF TRUTH AND ‚ÄÚIDEAL‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAT BOTTOM, FORMULAS FOR A RIGHT TO REPUDIATE SCIENCE, A RIGHT TO LIE. LEIBNIZ AND KANT‚ÄÎTHESE TWO GREATEST BRAKE SHOES OF INTELLECTUAL INTEGRITY IN EUROPE!

FINALLY, WHEN ON THE BRIDGE BETWEEN TWO CENTURIES OF DECADENCE, A FORCE MAJEURE8 OF GENIUS AND WILL BECAME VISIBLE, STRONG ENOUGH TO CREATE A UNITY OUT OF EUROPE, A POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNITY FOR THE SAKE OF A WORLD GOVERNMENT‚ÄÎTHE GERMANS WITH THEIR ‚ÄÚWARS OF LIBERATION‚ÄÙ DID EUROPE OUT OF THE MEANING, THE MIRACLE OF MEANING IN THE EXISTENCE OF NAPOLEON; HENCE THEY HAVE ON THEIR CONSCIENCE ALL THAT FOLLOWED, THAT IS WITH US TODAY‚ÄÎTHIS MOST ANTI-CULTURAL SICKNESS AND UNREASON THERE IS, NATIONALISM, THIS N√©VROSE NATIONALE9 WITH WHICH EUROPE IS SICK, THIS PERPETUATION OF EUROPEAN PARTICULARISM, OF PETTY POLITICS:10 THEY HAVE DEPRIVED EUROPE ITSELF OF ITS MEANING, OF ITS REASON‚ÄÎTHEY HAVE DRIVEN IT INTO A DEAD-END STREET.11‚ÄÎDOES ANYONE BESIDES ME KNOW THE WAY OUT OF THIS DEAD-END STREET?‚ÄÎA TASK THAT IS GREAT ENOUGH TO UNITE NATIONS AGAIN?





3


AND IN THE END, WHY SHOULD I NOT VOICE MY SUSPICION? IN MY CASE, TOO, THE GERMANS WILL TRY EVERYTHING TO BRING FORTH FROM A TREMENDOUS DESTINY‚ÄÎA MOUSE. SO FAR THEY HAVE COMPROMISED THEMSELVES IN MY CASE; I DOUBT THAT THEY WILL DO ANY BETTER IN THE FUTURE.‚ÄÎAH, HOW I WISH I WERE A BAD PROPHET IN THIS CASE!‚ÄÎMY NATURAL READERS AND LISTENERS ARE EVEN NOW RUSSIANS, SCANDINAVIANS, AND FRENCHMEN‚ÄÎWILL IT ALWAYS BE THAT WAY?

IN THE HISTORY OF THE QUEST FOR KNOWLEDGE THE GERMANS ARE INSCRIBED WITH NOTHING BUT AMBIGUOUS NAMES; THEY HAVE ALWAYS BROUGHT FORTH ONLY ‚ÄÚUNCONSCIOUS‚ÄÙ COUNTERFEITERS (FICHTE, SCHELLING, SCHOPENHAUER, HEGEL, AND SCHLEIERMACHER DESERVE THIS EPITHET AS WELL AS KANT AND LEIBNIZ: THEY ARE ALL MERE VEIL MAKERS):1 THEY SHALL NEVER ENJOY THE HONOR THAT THE FIRST HONEST SPIRIT IN THE HISTORY OF THE SPIRIT, THE SPIRIT IN WHOM TRUTH COMES TO JUDGMENT OVER THE COUNTERFEITING OF FOUR MILLENNIA, SHOULD BE COUNTED ONE WITH THE GERMAN SPIRIT.

THE ‚ÄÚGERMAN SPIRIT‚ÄÙ IS FOR ME BAD AIR: I BREATHE WITH DIFFICULTY NEAR THE BY NOW INSTINCTIVE UNCLEANLINESS IN PSYCHOLOGICIS WHICH EVERY WORD, EVERY FACIAL EXPRESSION OF A GERMAN BETRAYS. THEY HAVE NEVER GONE THROUGH A SEVENTEENTH CENTURY OF HARD SELF-EXAMINATION, LIKE THE FRENCH‚ÄÎA LA ROCHEFOUCAULD AND A DESCARTES ARE A HUNDRED TIMES SUPERIOR IN HONESTY TO THE FOREMOST GERMANS‚ÄÎTO THIS DAY THEY HAVE NOT HAD A PSYCHOLOGIST. BUT PSYCHOLOGY IS ALMOST THE MEASURE OF THE CLEANLINESS OR UNCLEANLINESS OF A RACE.

AND IF ONE IS NOT EVEN CLEANLY, HOW SHOULD ONE HAVE DEPTH? IT IS WITH GERMANS ALMOST AS IT IS WITH WOMEN: ONE NEVER FATHOMS THEIR DEPTHS; THEY DON‚ÄÔT HAVE ANY, THAT IS ALL. THEY AREN‚ÄÔT EVEN SHALLOW.2‚ÄÎWHAT IS CALLED ‚ÄÚDEEP‚ÄÙ IN GERMANY IS PRECISELY THIS INSTINCTIVE UNCLEANLINESS IN RELATION TO ONESELF OF WHICH I HAVE JUST SPOKEN: ONE DOES NOT WANT TO GAIN CLARITY ABOUT ONESELF. MIGHT I NOT PROPOSE THE WORD ‚ÄÚGERMAN‚ÄÙ AS AN INTERNATIONAL COINAGE FOR THIS PSYCHOLOGICAL DEPRAVITY?‚ÄÎAT THIS VERY MOMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, THE GERMAN KAISER CALLS IT HIS ‚ÄÚCHRISTIAN DUTY‚ÄÙ TO LIBERATE THE SLAVES IN AFRICA: AMONG US OTHER EUROPEANS THIS WOULD THEN SIMPLY BE CALLED ‚ÄÚGERMAN.‚ÄÙ

HAVE THE GERMANS PRODUCED EVEN ONE BOOK THAT HAS DEPTH? THEY EVEN LACK THE IDEA OF DEPTH IN A BOOK. I HAVE MET SCHOLARS WHO CONSIDERED KANT DEEP; AT THE PRUSSIAN COURT, I FEAR, HERR VON TREITSCHKE IS CONSIDERED DEEP. AND WHEN I OCCASIONALLY PRAISE STENDHAL AS A DEEP PSYCHOLOGIST, I HAVE ENCOUNTERED PROFESSORS AT GERMAN UNIVERSITIES WHO ASKED ME TO SPELL HIS NAME.

AND WHY SHOULD I NOT GO ALL THE WAY? I LIKE TO MAKE A CLEAN SWEEP OF THINGS. IT IS PART OF MY AMBITION TO BE CONSIDERED A DESPISER OF THE GERMANS PAR EXCELLENCE. MY MISTRUST OF THE GERMAN CHARACTER I EXPRESSED EVEN WHEN I WAS TWENTY-SIX (IN THE THIRD UNTIMELY ONE, SECTION 6)1‚ÄÎTHE GERMANS SEEM IMPOSSIBLE TO ME. WHEN I IMAGINE A TYPE OF MAN THAT ANTAGONIZES ALL MY INSTINCTS, IT ALWAYS TURNS INTO A GERMAN.2

THE FIRST POINT ON WHICH I ‚ÄÚTRY THE REINS‚ÄÙ IS TO SEE WHETHER A MAN HAS A FEELING FOR DISTANCE IN HIS SYSTEM, WHETHER HE SEES RANK, DEGREE,3 ORDER BETWEEN MAN AND MAN EVERYWHERE, WHETHER HE MAKES DISTINCTIONS: WITH THAT ONE IS A GENTILHOMME; OTHERWISE ONE BELONGS HOPELESSLY IN THE BROAD-MINDED‚ÄÎAH, SO GOOD-NATURED‚ÄÎCONCEPT OF CANAILLE. BUT THE GERMANS ARE CANAILLE‚ÄÎAH, THEY ARE SO GOOD-NATURED.‚ÄÎONE LOWERS ONESELF WHEN ONE ASSOCIATES WITH GERMANS: THE GERMAN PUTS OTHERS ON A PAR.‚ÄÎEXCEPT FOR MY ASSOCIATION WITH A FEW ARTISTS, ABOVE ALL WITH RICHARD WAGNER, I HAVE NOT SPENT ONE GOOD HOUR WITH A GERMAN.4‚ÄÎ

IF THE MOST PROFOUND SPIRIT OF ALL MILLENNIA APPEARED AMONG GERMANS, SOME SAVIORESS OF THE CAPITOL5 WOULD SUPPOSE THAT HER VERY UNBEAUTIFUL SOUL DESERVED AT LEAST EQUAL CONSIDERATION.‚ÄÎI CANNOT ENDURE THIS RACE AMONG WHOM ONE IS ALWAYS IN BAD COMPANY, THAT HAS NO FINGERS FOR NUANCES‚ÄÎALAS, I AM A NUANCE‚ÄÎTHAT HAS NO ESPRIT IN ITS FEET AND DOES NOT EVEN KNOW HOW TO WALK.‚ÄÎTHE GERMANS ULTIMATELY HAVE NO FEET AT ALL, THEY HAVE ONLY LEGS.‚ÄÎTHE GERMANS HAVE NO IDEA HOW VULGAR THEY ARE; BUT THAT IS THE SUPERLATIVE OF VULGARITY‚ÄÎTHEY ARE NOT EVEN ASHAMED OF BEING MERELY GERMANS.‚ÄÎTHEY JOIN IN EVERY DISCUSSION; THEY CONSIDER THEMSELVES DECISIVE; I FEAR THEY HAVE REACHED A DECISION EVEN ABOUT ME.

MY WHOLE LIFE IS THE DEMONSTRATION DE RIGUEUR6 OF THESE PROPOSITIONS. IN VAIN DO I SEEK AMONG THEM FOR SOME SIGN OF TACT, OF D√©LICATESSE IN RELATION TO ME. FROM JEWS, YES; NEVER YET FROM GERMANS.

IT IS PART OF MY NATURE TO BE GENTLE AND BENEVOLENT TOWARD EVERYBODY‚ÄÎI HAVE THE RIGHT NOT TO MAKE DISTINCTIONS‚ÄÎBUT THAT DOES NOT PREVENT ME FROM KEEPING MY EYES OPEN. I EXCEPT NO ONE, LEAST OF ALL MY FRIENDS; IN THE END I HOPE THAT THIS HAS NOT DIMINISHED MY HUMANITY IN RELATION TO THEM. THERE ARE FIVE OR SIX THINGS THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A POINT OF HONOR WITH ME.‚ÄÎNEVERTHELESS IT IS TRUE THAT ALMOST EVERY LETTER THAT HAS REACHED ME FOR YEARS NOW STRIKES ME AS A PIECE OF CYNICISM: THERE IS MORE CYNICISM IN BEING KIND TO ME THAN IN ANY HATRED.

I TELL EVERY ONE OF MY FRIENDS TO HIS FACE THAT HE HAS NEVER CONSIDERED IT WORTH WHILE TO STUDY ANY OF MY WRITINGS: I INFER FROM THE SMALLEST SIGNS THAT THEY DO NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT IS IN THEM. AS FOR MY ZARATHUSTRA: WHO AMONG MY FRIENDS SAW MORE IN IT THAN AN IMPERMISSIBLE BUT FORTUNATELY UTTERLY INCONSEQUENTIAL PRESUMPTION?

TEN YEARS‚ÄÎAND NOBODY IN GERMANY HAS FELT BOUND IN CONSCIENCE TO DEFEND MY NAME AGAINST THE ABSURD SILENCE UNDER WHICH IT LIES BURIED: IT WAS A FOREIGNER, A DANE, WHO FIRST POSSESSED SUFFICIENT REFINEMENT OF INSTINCT AND COURAGE FOR THIS, WHO FELT OUTRAGED BY MY ALLEGED FRIENDS.‚ÄÎAT WHAT GERMAN UNIVERSITY WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TODAY TO HAVE LECTURES ON MY PHILOSOPHY, SUCH AS WERE GIVEN LAST SPRING IN COPENHAGEN BY DR. GEORG BRANDES WHO THUS PROVED HIMSELF ONCE AGAIN AS A PSYCHOLOGIST?

I MYSELF HAVE NEVER SUFFERED FROM ALL THIS; WHAT IS NECESSARY DOES NOT HURT ME; AMOR FATI7 IS MY INMOST NATURE. BUT THIS DOES NOT PRECLUDE MY LOVE OF IRONY, EVEN WORLD-HISTORICAL IRONY. AND THUS I HAVE SENT INTO THE WORLD, ABOUT TWO YEARS BEFORE THE SHATTERING LIGHTNING BOLT OF THE REVALUATION THAT WILL MAKE THE EARTH CONVULSE‚ÄÎTHE CASE OF WAGNER: LET THE GERMANS COMMIT ONE MORE IMMORTAL BLUNDER IN RELATION TO ME THAT WILL STAND IN ALL ETERNITY. THERE IS BARELY ENOUGH TIME LEFT FOR THAT.‚ÄÎHAS IT BEEN ACCOMPLISHED?‚ÄÎMOST DELIGHTFULLY, MY DEAR TEUTONS! MY COMPLIMENTS!8

THE REFERENCE TO THE REVALUATION, IN THE TEXT, SHOULD BE COMPARED WITH SECTION 3 OF ‚ÄÚTWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS,‚ÄÙ ABOVE: NIETZSCHE IS SPEAKING OF HIS FORTHCOMING BOOK. HE IS NOT IMPLYING THAT THE EARTH WILL BE CONVULSED BY HIS REVELATION OF NEW VALUES; AS HE EXPLAINS IN THE FIRST SECTION OF ‚ÄÚBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL,‚ÄÙ ABOVE, THE REVALUATION IS A ‚ÄÚNO-SAYING‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎA CRITIQUE OF FAITH AND MORALS. THIS POINT IS DEVELOPED FURTHER ON THE FOLLOWING PAGES.





WHY I AM A DESTINY





1


I KNOW MY FATE. ONE DAY MY NAME WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEMORY OF SOMETHING TREMENDOUS‚ÄÎA CRISIS WITHOUT EQUAL ON EARTH, THE MOST PROFOUND COLLISION OF CONSCIENCE, A DECISION THAT WAS CONJURED UP AGAINST EVERYTHING THAT HAD BEEN BELIEVED, DEMANDED, HALLOWED SO FAR. I AM NO MAN, I AM DYNAMITE.1‚ÄÎYET FOR ALL THAT, THERE IS NOTHING IN ME OF A FOUNDER OF A RELIGION‚ÄÎRELIGIONS ARE AFFAIRS OF THE RABBLE; I FIND IT NECESSARY TO WASH MY HANDS AFTER I HAVE COME INTO CONTACT WITH RELIGIOUS PEOPLE.‚ÄÎI WANT NO ‚ÄÚBELIEVERS;‚ÄÙ I THINK I AM TOO MALICIOUS TO BELIEVE IN MYSELF; I NEVER SPEAK TO MASSES.‚ÄÎI HAVE A TERRIBLE FEAR THAT ONE DAY I WILL BE PRONOUNCED HOLY: YOU WILL GUESS WHY I PUBLISH THIS BOOK BEFORE; IT SHALL PREVENT PEOPLE FROM DOING MISCHIEF WITH ME.2

I DO NOT WANT TO BE A HOLY MAN; SOONER EVEN A BUFFOON.‚ÄÎPERHAPS I AM A BUFFOON.‚ÄÎYET IN SPITE OF THAT‚ÄÎOR RATHER NOT IN SPITE OF IT, BECAUSE SO FAR NOBODY HAS BEEN MORE MENDACIOUS THAN HOLY MEN‚ÄÎTHE TRUTH SPEAKS OUT OF ME.‚ÄÎBUT MY TRUTH IS TERRIBLE; FOR SO FAR ONE HAS CALLED LIES TRUTH.

REVALUATION OF ALL VALUES: THAT IS MY FORMULA FOR AN ACT OF SUPREME SELF-EXAMINATION ON THE PART OF HUMANITY, BECOME FLESH AND GENIUS IN ME. IT IS MY FATE THAT I HAVE TO BE THE FIRST DECENT HUMAN BEING; THAT I KNOW MYSELF TO STAND IN OPPOSITION TO THE MENDACIOUSNESS OF MILLENNIA.‚ÄÎI WAS THE FIRST TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH BY BEING THE FIRST TO EXPERIENCE LIES AS LIES‚ÄÎSMELLING THEM OUT.‚ÄÎMY GENIUS IS IN MY NOSTRILS.

I CONTRADICT AS HAS NEVER BEEN CONTRADICTED BEFORE AND AM NEVERTHELESS THE OPPOSITE OF A NO-SAYING SPIRIT. I AM A BRINGER OF GLAD TIDINGS LIKE NO ONE BEFORE ME; I KNOW TASKS OF SUCH ELEVATION THAT ANY NOTION OF THEM HAS BEEN LACKING SO FAR; ONLY BEGINNING WITH ME ARE THERE HOPES AGAIN. FOR ALL THAT, I AM NECESSARILY ALSO THE MAN OF CALAMITY. FOR WHEN TRUTH ENTERS INTO A FIGHT WITH THE LIES OF MILLENNIA, WE SHALL HAVE UPHEAVALS, A CONVULSION OF EARTHQUAKES, A MOVING OF MOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS, THE LIKE OF WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN DREAMED OF. THE CONCEPT OF POLITICS WILL HAVE MERGED ENTIRELY WITH A WAR OF SPIRITS; ALL POWER STRUCTURES OF THE OLD SOCIETY WILL HAVE BEEN EXPLODED‚ÄÎALL OF THEM ARE BASED ON LIES: THERE WILL BE WARS THE LIKE OF WHICH HAVE NEVER YET BEEN SEEN ON EARTH. IT IS ONLY BEGINNING WITH ME THAT THE EARTH KNOWS GREAT POLITICS.





2


YOU WANT A FORMULA FOR SUCH A DESTINY BECOME MAN? THAT IS TO BE FOUND IN MY ZARATHUSTRA:

‚ÄÚAND WHOEVER WANTS TO BE1 A CREATOR IN GOOD AND EVIL, MUST FIRST BE AN ANNIHILATOR AND BREAK VALUES. THUS THE HIGHEST EVIL BELONGS TO THE GREATEST GOODNESS: BUT THIS IS‚ÄÎBEING CREATIVE.‚ÄÙ

I AM BY FAR THE MOST TERRIBLE HUMAN BEING THAT HAS EXISTED SO FAR; THIS DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT I SHALL BE THE MOST BENEFICIAL. I KNOW THE PLEASURE IN DESTROYING TO A DEGREE THAT ACCORDS WITH MY POWERS TO DESTROY‚ÄÎIN BOTH RESPECTS I OBEY MY DIONYSIAN NATURE WHICH DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO SEPARATE DOING NO FROM SAYING YES. I AM THE FIRST IMMORALIST: THAT MAKES ME THE ANNIHILATOR PAR EXCELLENCE.





3


I HAVE NOT BEEN ASKED, AS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASKED, WHAT THE NAME OF ZARATHUSTRA MEANS IN MY MOUTH, THE MOUTH OF THE FIRST IMMORALIST: FOR WHAT CONSTITUTES THE TREMENDOUS HISTORICAL UNIQUENESS OF THAT PERSIAN IS JUST THE OPPOSITE OF THIS. ZARATHUSTRA WAS THE FIRST TO CONSIDER THE FIGHT OF GOOD AND EVIL THE VERY WHEEL IN THE MACHINERY OF THINGS: THE TRANSPOSITION OF MORALITY INTO, THE METAPHYSICAL REALM, AS A FORCE, CAUSE, AND END IN ITSELF, IS HIS WORK. BUT THIS QUESTION ITSELF IS AT BOTTOM ITS OWN ANSWER. ZARATHUSTRA CREATED THIS MOST CALAMITOUS ERROR, MORALITY; CONSEQUENTLY, HE MUST ALSO BE THE FIRST TO RECOGNIZE IT. NOT ONLY HAS HE MORE EXPERIENCE IN THIS MATTER, FOR A LONGER TIME, THAN ANY OTHER THINKER‚ÄÎAFTER ALL, THE WHOLE OF HISTORY IS THE REFUTATION BY EXPERIMENT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE SO-CALLED ‚ÄÚMORAL WORLD ORDER‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎWHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT IS THAT ZARATHUSTRA IS MORE TRUTHFUL THAN ANY OTHER THINKER. HIS DOCTRINE, AND HIS ALONE, POSITS TRUTHFULNESS AS THE HIGHEST VIRTUE; THIS MEANS THE OPPOSITE OF THE COWARDICE OF THE ‚ÄÚIDEALIST‚ÄÙ WHO FLEES FROM REALITY; ZARATHUSTRA HAS MORE INTESTINAL FORTITUDE THAN ALL OTHER THINKERS TAKEN TOGETHER. TO SPEAK THE TRUTH AND TO SHOOT WELL WITH ARROWS, THAT IS PERSIAN VIRTUE.2‚ÄÎAM I UNDERSTOOD?‚ÄÎTHE SELF-OVERCOMING OF MORALITY, OUT OF TRUTHFULNESS; THE SELF-OVERCOMING OF THE MORALIST, INTO HIS OPPOSITE‚ÄÎINTO ME‚ÄÎTHAT IS WHAT THE NAME OF ZARATHUSTRA MEANS IN MY MOUTH.

FUNDAMENTALLY, MY TERM IMMORALIST INVOLVES TWO NEGATIONS. FOR ONE, I NEGATE A TYPE OF MAN THAT HAS SO FAR BEEN CONSIDERED SUPREME: THE GOOD, THE BENEVOLENT, THE BENEFICENT. AND THEN I NEGATE A TYPE OF MORALITY THAT HAS BECOME PREVALENT AND PREDOMINANT AS MORALITY ITSELF‚ÄÎTHE MORALITY OF DECADENCE OR, MORE CONCRETELY, CHRISTIAN MORALITY. IT WOULD BE PERMISSIBLE TO CONSIDER THE SECOND CONTRADICTION THE MORE DECISIVE ONE, SINCE I TAKE THE OVERESTIMATION OF GOODNESS AND BENEVOLENCE ON A LARGE SCALE FOR A CONSEQUENCE OF DECADENCE, FOR A SYMPTOM OF WEAKNESS, IRRECONCILABLE WITH AN ASCENDING, YES-SAYING LIFE: NEGATING AND DESTROYING ARE CONDITIONS OF SAYING YES.1

LET ME TARRY OVER THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE GOOD HUMAN BEING. TO ESTIMATE WHAT A TYPE OF MAN IS WORTH, ONE MUST CALCULATE THE PRICE PAID FOR HIS PRESERVATION‚ÄÎONE MUST KNOW THE CONDITIONS OF HIS EXISTENCE. THE CONDITION OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE GOOD IS THE LIE: PUT DIFFERENTLY, NOT WANTING TO SEE AT ANY PRICE HOW REALITY IS CONSTITUTED FUNDAMENTALLY‚ÄÎNAMELY, NOT IN SUCH A WAY AS TO ELICIT BENEVOLENT INSTINCTS AT ALL TIMES, AND EVEN LESS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO TOLERATE AT ALL TIMES THE INTERFERENCE OF THOSE WHO ARE MYOPICALLY GOOD-NATURED. TO CONSIDER DISTRESS OF ALL KINDS AS AN OBJECTION, AS SOMETHING THAT MUST BE ABOLISHED, IS THE NIAISERIE2 PAR EXCELLENCE AND, ON A LARGE SCALE, A VERITABLE DISASTER IN ITS CONSEQUENCES, A NEMESIS3 OF STUPIDITY‚ÄÎALMOST AS STUPID AS WOULD BE THE DESIRE TO ABOLISH BAD WEATHER‚ÄÎSAY, FROM PITY FOR POOR PEOPLE.

IN THE GREAT ECONOMY OF THE WHOLE, THE TERRIBLE ASPECTS OF REALITY (IN AFFECTS, IN DESIRES, IN THE WILL TO POWER) ARE TO AN INCALCULABLE DEGREE MORE NECESSARY THAN THAT FORM OF PETTY HAPPINESS WHICH PEOPLE CALL ‚ÄÚGOODNESS;‚ÄÙ ONE ACTUALLY HAS TO BE QUITE LENIENT TO ACCORD THE LATTER ANY PLACE AT ALL, CONSIDERING THAT IT PRESUPPOSES AN INSTINCTIVE MENDACIOUSNESS. I SHALL HAVE A MAJOR OCCASION TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THE HISTORICAL CONSEQUENCES OF OPTIMISM, THIS ABORTION OF THE HOMINES OPTIMI4 HAVE BEEN UNCANNY BEYOND MEASURE. ZARATHUSTRA, WHO WAS THE FIRST TO GRASP THAT THE OPTIMIST IS JUST AS DECADENT AS THE PESSIMIST, AND PERHAPS MORE HARMFUL, SAYS: ‚ÄÚGOOD MEN NEVER SPEAK THE TRUTH.‚ÄÙ5

‚ÄÚFALSE COASTS AND ASSURANCES THE GOOD HAVE TAUGHT YOU; IN THE LIES OF THE GOOD YOU WERE HATCHED AND HUDDLED. EVERYTHING HAS BEEN MADE FRAUDULENT AND HAS BEEN TWISTED THROUGH AND THROUGH BY THE GOOD.‚ÄÙ6

FORTUNATELY, THE WORLD HAS NOT BEEN DESIGNED WITH A VIEW TO SUCH INSTINCTS THAT ONLY GOOD-NATURED HERD ANIMALS COULD FIND THEIR NARROW HAPPINESS IN IT: TO DEMAND THAT ALL SHOULD BECOME ‚ÄÚGOOD HUMAN BEINGS,‚ÄÙ HERD ANIMALS, BLUE-EYED, BENEVOLENT, ‚ÄÚBEAUTIFUL SOULS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎOR AS MR. HERBERT SPENCER7 WOULD HAVE IT, ALTRUISTIC‚ÄÎWOULD DEPRIVE EXISTENCE OF ITS GREAT CHARACTER AND WOULD CASTRATE MEN AND REDUCE THEM TO THE LEVEL OF DESICCATED CHINESE STAGNATION.‚ÄÎAND THIS HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED!‚ÄÎPRECISELY THIS HAS BEEN CALLED MORALITY.

IN THIS SENSE, ZARATHUSTRA CALLS THE GOOD, NOW ‚ÄÚTHE LAST MEN,‚ÄÙ8 NOW THE ‚ÄÚBEGINNING OF THE END;‚ÄÙ ABOVE ALL, HE CONSIDERS THEM THE MOST HARMFUL TYPE OF MAN BECAUSE THEY PREVAIL AT THE EXPENSE OF TRUTH AND AT THE EXPENSE OF THE FUTURE9

‚ÄÚTHE GOOD ARE UNABLE TO CREATE; THEY ARE ALWAYS THE BEGINNING OF THE END; THEY CRUCIFY HIM WHO WRITES NEW VALUES ON NEW TABLETS; THEY SACRIFICE THE FUTURE TO THEMSELVES‚ÄÎTHEY SACRIFICE ALL MAN‚ÄÔS FUTURE.

‚ÄÚTHE GOOD HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE BEGINNING OF THE END.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND WHATEVER HARM THOSE DO WHO SLANDER THE WORLD, THE HARM DONE BY THE GOOD IS THE MOST HARMFUL HARM.‚ÄÙ10





5


ZARATHUSTRA, THE FIRST PSYCHOLOGIST OF THE GOOD, IS‚ÄÎCONSEQUENTLY‚ÄÎA FRIEND OF THE EVIL. WHEN A DECADENT TYPE OF MAN ASCENDED TO THE RANK OF THE HIGHEST TYPE, THIS COULD ONLY HAPPEN AT THE EXPENSE OF ITS COUNTERTYPE, THE TYPE OF MAN THAT IS STRONG AND SURE OF LIFE. WHEN THE HERD ANIMAL IS IRRADIATED BY THE GLORY OF THE PUREST VIRTUE, THE EXCEPTIONAL MAN MUST HAVE BEEN DEVALUATED INTO EVIL. WHEN MENDACIOUSNESS AT ANY PRICE MONOPOLIZES THE WORD ‚ÄÚTRUTH‚ÄÙ FOR ITS PERSPECTIVE, THE REALLY TRUTHFUL MAN IS BOUND TO BE BRANDED WITH THE WORST NAMES. ZARATHUSTRA LEAVES NO DOUBT AT THIS POINT: HE SAYS THAT IT WAS HIS INSIGHT PRECISELY INTO THE GOOD, THE ‚ÄÚBEST,‚ÄÙ THAT MADE HIM SHUDDER AT MAN IN GENERAL; THAT IT WAS FROM THIS AVERSION THAT HE GREW WINGS ‚ÄÚTO SOAR OFF INTO DISTANT FUTURES;‚ÄÙ HE DOES NOT CONCEAL THE FACT THAT HIS TYPE OF MAN, A RELATIVELY SUPERHUMAN TYPE, IS SUPERHUMAN PRECISELY IN ITS RELATION TO THE GOOD‚ÄÎTHAT THE GOOD AND THE JUST WOULD CALL HIS OVERMAN DEVIL.

‚ÄÚYOU HIGHEST MEN WHOM MY EYES HAVE SEEN, THIS IS MY DOUBT ABOUT YOU AND MY SECRET LAUGHTER: I GUESS THAT YOU WOULD CALL MY OVERMAN‚ÄÎDEVIL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT IS GREAT IS SO ALIEN TO YOUR SOULS THAT THE OVERMAN WOULD BE TERRIFYING TO YOU IN HIS GOODNESS.‚ÄÙ1

IT IS HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE THAT ONE MUST MAKE A START TO COMPREHEND WHAT ZARATHUSTRA WANTS: THIS TYPE OF MAN THAT HE CONCEIVES, CONCEIVES REALITY AS IT IS, BEING STRONG ENOUGH TO DO SO; THIS TYPE IS NOT ESTRANGED OR REMOVED FROM REALITY BUT IS REALITY ITSELF AND EXEMPLIFIES ALL THAT IS TERRIBLE AND QUESTIONABLE IN IT‚ÄÎONLY IN THAT WAY CAN MAN ATTAIN GREATNESS.





6


THERE IS YET ANOTHER SENSE, HOWEVER, IN WHICH I HAVE CHOSEN THE WORD IMMORALIST AS A SYMBOL AND BADGE OF HONOR FOR MYSELF; I AM PROUD OF HAVING THIS WORD WHICH DISTINGUISHES ME FROM THE WHOLE OF HUMANITY. NOBODY YET HAS FELT CHRISTIAN MORALITY TO BE BENEATH HIM: THAT REQUIRES A HEIGHT, A VIEW OF DISTANCES, A HITHERTO ALTOGETHER UNHEARD-OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DEPTH AND PROFUNDITY. CHRISTIAN MORALITY HAS BEEN THE CIRCE OF ALL THINKERS SO FAR‚ÄÎTHEY STOOD IN HER SERVICE.‚ÄÎWHO BEFORE ME CLIMBED INTO THE CAVERNS FROM WHICH THE POISONOUS FUMES OF THIS TYPE OF IDEAL‚ÄÎSLANDER OF THE WORLD‚ÄÎARE RISING? WHO EVEN DARED TO SUSPECT THAT THEY ARE CAVERNS? WHO AMONG PHILOSOPHERS WAS A PSYCHOLOGIST AT ALL BEFORE ME, AND NOT RATHER THE OPPOSITE, A ‚ÄÚHIGHER SWINDLER‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚIDEALIST‚ÄÙ? THERE WAS NO PSYCHOLOGY AT ALL BEFORE ME.‚ÄÎTO BE THE FIRST HERE MAY BE A CURSE; IT IS AT ANY RATE A DESTINY: FOR ONE IS ALSO THE FIRST TO DESPISE.‚ÄÎNAUSEA AT MAN IS MY DANGER.





7


HAVE I BEEN UNDERSTOOD?‚ÄÎWHAT DEFINES ME, WHAT SETS ME APART FROM THE WHOLE REST OF HUMANITY IS THAT I UNCOVERED CHRISTIAN MORALITY. THAT IS WHY I NEEDED A WORD THAT HAD THE MEANING OF A PROVOCATION FOR EVERYBODY. THAT THEY DID NOT OPEN THEIR EYES EARLIER AT THIS POINT, I REGARD AS THE GREATEST UNCLEANLINESS THAT HUMANITY HAS ON ITS CONSCIENCE; AS SELF-DECEPTION BECOME INSTINCTIVE; AS A FUNDAMENTAL WILL NOT TO SEE ANY EVENT, ANY CAUSALITY, ANY REALITY; AS COUNTERFEITING IN PSYCHOLOGICIS TO THE POINT OF CRIMINALITY. BLINDNESS TO CHRISTIANITY IS THE CRIME PAR EXCELLENCE‚ÄÎTHE CRIME AGAINST LIFE.

THE MILLENNIA, THE NATIONS, THE FIRST AND THE LAST, THE PHILOSOPHERS AND OLD WOMEN‚ÄÎEXCEPTING FIVE, SIX MOMENTS IN HISTORY, AND ME AS THE SEVENTH‚ÄÎAT THIS POINT ALL OF THEM ARE WORTHY OF EACH OTHER. THE CHRISTIAN HAS SO FAR BEEN THE ‚ÄÚMORAL BEING‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎA MATCHLESS CURIOSITY‚ÄÎAND AS THE ‚ÄÚMORAL BEING‚ÄÙ HE WAS MORE ABSURD, MENDACIOUS, VAIN, FRIVOLOUS, AND MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS FOR HIMSELF THAN EVEN THE GREATEST DESPISER OF HUMANITY COULD IMAGINE IN HIS DREAMS. CHRISTIAN MORALITY‚ÄÎTHE MOST MALIGNANT FORM OF THE WILL TO LIE, THE REAL CIRCE OF HUMANITY‚ÄÎTHAT WHICH CORRUPTED HUMANITY. IT IS NOT ERROR AS ERROR THAT HORRIFIES ME AT THIS SIGHT‚ÄÎNOT THE LACK, FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, OF ‚ÄÚGOOD WILL,‚ÄÙ DISCIPLINE, DECENCY, COURAGE IN MATTERS OF THE SPIRIT, REVEALED BY ITS VICTORY: IT IS THE LACK OF NATURE, IT IS THE UTTERLY GRUESOME FACT THAT ANTINATURE ITSELF RECEIVED THE HIGHEST HONORS AS MORALITY AND WAS FIXED OVER HUMANITY AS LAW AND CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE.‚ÄÎTO BLUNDER TO SUCH AN EXTENT, NOT AS INDIVIDUALS, NOT AS A PEOPLE, BUT AS HUMANITY!‚ÄÎTHAT ONE TAUGHT MEN TO DESPISE THE VERY FIRST INSTINCTS OF LIFE; THAT ONE MENDACIOUSLY INVENTED A ‚ÄÚSOUL,‚ÄÙ A ‚ÄÚSPIRIT‚ÄÙ TO RUIN THE BODY; THAT ONE TAUGHT MEN TO EXPERIENCE THE PRESUPPOSITION OF LIFE, SEXUALITY, AS SOMETHING UNCLEAN; THAT ONE LOOKS FOR THE EVIL PRINCIPLE IN WHAT IS MOST PROFOUNDLY NECESSARY FOR GROWTH, IN SEVERE SELF-LOVE1 (THIS VERY WORD CONSTITUTES SLANDER); THAT, CONVERSELY, ONE REGARDS THE TYPICAL SIGNS OF DECLINE AND CONTRADICTION OF THE INSTINCTS, THE ‚ÄÚSELFLESS,‚ÄÙ THE LOSS OF A CENTER OF GRAVITY, ‚ÄÚDEPERSONALIZATION‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚNEIGHBOR LOVE‚ÄÙ (ADDICTION TO THE NEIGHBOR) AS THE HIGHER VALUE‚ÄÎWHAT AM I SAYING?‚ÄÎTHE ABSOLUTE VALUE!

WHAT? IS HUMANITY ITSELF DECADENT? WAS IT ALWAYS?‚ÄÎWHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT IT HAS BEEN TAUGHT ONLY DECADENCE VALUES AS SUPREME VALUES. THE MORALITY THAT WOULD UN-SELF MAN IS THE MORALITY OF DECLINE PAR EXCELLENCE‚ÄÎTHE FACT, ‚ÄÚI AM DECLINING,‚ÄÙ TRANSPOSED INTO THE IMPERATIVE, ‚ÄÚALL OF YOU OUGHT TO DECLINE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND NOT ONLY INTO THE IMPERATIVE.‚ÄÎTHIS ONLY MORALITY THAT HAS BEEN TAUGHT SO FAR, THAT OF UN-SELFING, REVEALS A WILL TO THE END; FUNDAMENTALLY, IT NEGATES LIFE.

THIS WOULD STILL LEAVE OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT NOT HUMANITY IS DEGENERATING BUT ONLY THAT PARASITICAL TYPE OF MAN‚ÄÎTHAT OF THE PRIEST‚ÄÎWHICH HAS USED MORALITY TO RAISE ITSELF MENDACIOUSLY TO THE POSITION OF DETERMINING HUMAN VALUES‚ÄÎFINDING IN CHRISTIAN MORALITY THE MEANS TO COME TO POWER.‚ÄÎINDEED, THIS IS MY INSIGHT: THE TEACHERS, THE LEADERS OF HUMANITY, THEOLOGIANS ALL OF THEM, WERE ALSO, ALL OF THEM, DECADENTS: HENCE THE REVALUATION OF ALL VALUES INTO HOSTILITY TO LIFE,2 HENCE MORALITY‚ÄÎ

DEFINITION OF MORALITY: MORALITY‚ÄÎTHE IDIOSYNCRASY OF DECADENTS, WITH THE ULTERIOR MOTIVE OF REVENGING ONESELF AGAINST LIFE‚ÄÎSUCCESSFULLY. I ATTACH VALUE TO THIS DEFINITION.

HAVE I BEEN UNDERSTOOD?‚ÄÎI HAVE NOT SAID ONE WORD HERE THAT I DID NOT SAY FIVE YEARS AGO THROUGH THE MOUTH OF ZARATHUSTRA.

THE UNCOVERING OF CHRISTIAN MORALITY IS AN EVENT WITHOUT PARALLEL, A REAL CATASTROPHE. HE THAT IS ENLIGHTENED ABOUT THAT, IS A FORCE MAJEURE, A DESTINY‚ÄÎHE BREAKS THE HISTORY OF MANKIND IN TWO. ONE LIVES BEFORE HIM, OR ONE LIVES AFTER HIM.

THE LIGHTNING BOLT OF TRUTH STRUCK PRECISELY WHAT WAS HIGHEST SO FAR: LET WHOEVER COMPREHENDS WHAT HAS HERE BEEN DESTROYED SEE WHETHER ANYTHING IS LEFT IN HIS HANDS. EVERYTHING THAT HAS HITHERTO BEEN CALLED ‚ÄÚTRUTH‚ÄÙ HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS THE MOST HARMFUL, INSIDIOUS, AND SUBTERRANEAN FORM OF LIE; THE HOLY PRETEXT OF ‚ÄÚIMPROVING‚ÄÙ MANKIND, AS THE RUSE FOR SUCKING THE BLOOD OF LIFE ITSELF. MORALITY AS VAMPIRISM.

WHOEVER UNCOVERS MORALITY ALSO UNCOVERS THE DISVALUE OF ALL VALUES THAT ARE AND HAVE BEEN BELIEVED; HE NO LONGER SEES ANYTHING VENERABLE IN THE MOST VENERATED TYPES OF MAN, EVEN IN THOSE PRONOUNCED HOLY; HE CONSIDERS THEM THE MOST CALAMITOUS TYPE OF ABORTION‚ÄÎCALAMITOUS BECAUSE THEY EXERTED SUCH FASCINATION.

THE CONCEPT OF ‚ÄÚGOD‚ÄÙ INVENTED AS A COUNTERCONCEPT OF LIFE‚ÄÎEVERYTHING HARMFUL, POISONOUS, SLANDEROUS, THE WHOLE HOSTILITY UNTO DEATH AGAINST LIFE SYNTHESIZED IN THIS CONCEPT IN A GRUESOME UNITY! THE CONCEPT OF THE ‚ÄÚBEYOND,‚ÄÙ THE ‚ÄÚTRUE WORLD‚ÄÙ INVENTED IN ORDER TO DEVALUATE THE ONLY WORLD THERE IS1‚ÄÎIN ORDER TO RETAIN NO GOAL, NO REASON, NO TASK FOR OUR EARTHLY REALITY! THE CONCEPT OF THE ‚ÄÚSOUL,‚ÄÙ THE ‚ÄÚSPIRIT,‚ÄÙ FINALLY EVEN ‚ÄÚIMMORTAL SOUL,‚ÄÙ INVENTED IN ORDER TO DESPISE THE BODY,2 TO MAKE IT SICK, ‚ÄÚHOLY;‚ÄÙ TO OPPOSE WITH A GHASTLY LEVITY EVERYTHING THAT DESERVES TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY IN LIFE, THE QUESTIONS OF NOURISHMENT, ABODE, SPIRITUAL DIET, TREATMENT OF THE SICK, CLEANLINESS, AND WEATHER.3

IN PLACE OF HEALTH, THE ‚ÄÚSALVATION OF THE SOUL‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT IS, A FOLIE CIRCULAIRE4 BETWEEN PENITENTIAL CONVULSIONS AND HYSTERIA ABOUT REDEMPTION. THE CONCEPT OF ‚ÄÚSIN‚ÄÙ INVENTED ALONG WITH THE TORTURE INSTRUMENT THAT BELONGS WITH IT, THE CONCEPT OF ‚ÄÚFREE WILL,‚ÄÙ IN ORDER TO CONFUSE THE INSTINCTS, TO MAKE MISTRUST OF THE INSTINCTS SECOND NATURE. IN THE CONCEPT OF THE ‚ÄÚSELFLESS,‚ÄÙ THE ‚ÄÚSELF-DENIER,‚ÄÙ THE DISTINCTIVE SIGN OF DECADENCE, FEELING ATTRACTED BY WHAT IS HARMFUL, BEING UNABLE TO FIND ANY LONGER WHAT PROFITS ONE, SELF-DESTRUCTION IS TURNED INTO THE SIGN OF VALUE ITSELF, INTO ‚ÄÚDUTY,‚ÄÙ INTO ‚ÄÚHOLINESS,‚ÄÙ INTO WHAT IS ‚ÄÚDIVINE‚ÄÙ IN MAN. FINALLY‚ÄÎTHIS IS WHAT IS MOST TERRIBLE OF ALL‚ÄÎTHE CONCEPT OF THE GOOD MAN SIGNIFIES THAT ONE SIDES WITH ALL THAT IS WEAK, SICK, FAILURE, SUFFERING OF ITSELF‚ÄÎALL THAT OUGHT TO PERISH: THE PRINCIPLE OF SELECTION IS CROSSED5‚ÄÎAN IDEAL IS FABRICATED FROM THE CONTRADICTION AGAINST THE PROUD AND WELL-TURNED-OUT HUMAN BEING WHO SAYS YES, WHO IS SURE OF THE FUTURE, WHO GUARANTEES THE FUTURE‚ÄÎAND HE IS NOW CALLED EVIL.‚ÄÎ AND ALL THIS WAS BELIEVED, AS MORALITY!‚ÄÎECRASEZ L‚ÄÔINF√¢ME!6‚ÄÎ

EMERSON WITH HIS ESSAYS HAS BEEN A GOOD FRIEND AND CHEERED ME UP EVEN IN BLACK PERIODS: HE CONTAINS SO MUCH SKEPSIS, SO MANY ‚ÄÚPOSSIBILITIES‚ÄÙ THAT EVEN VIRTUE ACHIEVES ESPRIT IN HIS WRITINGS. A UNIQUE CASE! EVEN AS A BOY I ENJOYED LISTENING TO HIM. TRISTRAM SHANDY ALSO BELONGS TO MY EARLIEST FAVORITES; HOW I EXPERIENCED STERNE MAY BE SEEN FROM A VERY PENSIVE PASSAGE IN HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN [PART II, SECTION 113]. PERHAPS IT WAS FOR RELATED REASONS THAT I PREFERRED LICHTENBERG1 AMONG GERMAN BOOKS, WHILE THE ‚ÄÚIDEALIST‚ÄÙ SCHILLER WAS MORE THAN I COULD SWALLOW EVEN WHEN I WAS THIRTEEN.‚ÄÎI DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO FORGET ABB√© GALIANI,2 THIS MOST PROFOUND BUFFOON THAT EVER LIVED.

OF ALL BOOKS, ONE OF MY STRONGEST IMPRESSIONS IS THAT EXUBERANT PROVEN√ßAL, PETRONIUS, WHO COMPOSED THE LAST SATURA MENIPPEA.3 SUCH SOVEREIGN FREEDOM FROM ‚ÄÚMORALITY,‚ÄÙ FROM ‚ÄÚSERIOUSNESS,‚ÄÙ FROM HIS OWN SUBLIME TASTE; SUCH SUBTLETY IN HIS MIXTURE OF VULGAR AND ‚ÄÚEDUCATED‚ÄÙ LATIN; SUCH INDOMITABLE GOOD SPIRITS THAT LEAP WITH GRACE AND MALICE OVER ALL ANOMALIES OF THE ANCIENT ‚ÄÚSOUL‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÎI COULD NOT NAME ANY BOOK THAT MAKES AN EQUALLY LIBERATING IMPRESSION ON ME: THE EFFECT IS DIONYSIAN. IN CASES IN WHICH I FIND IT NECESSARY TO RECUPERATE QUICKLY FROM A BASE IMPRESSION‚ÄÎFOR EXAMPLE, BECAUSE FOR THE SAKE OF MY CRITIQUE OF CHRISTIANITY I HAD TO BREATHE ALL TOO LONG THE SWAMPY AIR OF THE APOSTLE PAUL‚ÄÎA FEW PAGES OF PETRONIUS SUFFICE ME AS A HEROIC REMEDY, AND IMMEDIATELY I AM WELL AGAIN.

MY WRITINGS ARE DIFFICULT; I HOPE THIS IS NOT CONSIDERED AN OBJECTION? TO UNDERSTAND THE MOST ABBREVIATED LANGUAGE EVER SPOKEN BY A PHILOSOPHER‚ÄÎAND ALSO THE ONE POOREST IN FORMULAS, MOST ALIVE, MOST ARTISTIC‚ÄÎONE MUST FOLLOW THE OPPOSITE PROCEDURE OF THAT GENERALLY REQUIRED BY PHILOSOPHICAL LITERATURE. USUALLY, ONE MUST CONDENSE, OR UPSET ONE‚ÄÔS DIGESTION; I HAVE TO BE DILUTED, LIQUEFIED, MIXED WITH WATER, ELSE ONE UPSETS ONE‚ÄÔS DIGESTION.

SILENCE IS AS MUCH OF AN INSTINCT WITH ME AS IS GARRULITY WITH OUR DEAR PHILOSOPHERS. I AM BRIEF; MY READERS THEMSELVES MUST BECOME LONG AND COMPREHENSIVE IN ORDER TO BRING UP AND TOGETHER ALL THAT I HAVE THOUGHT, AND THOUGHT DEEP DOWN.

ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE ARE PREREQUISITES FOR ‚ÄÚUNDERSTANDING‚ÄÙ HERE, WHICH VERY FEW CAN SATISFY: ONE MUST BE ABLE TO SEE A PROBLEM IN ITS PROPER PLACE‚ÄÎTHAT IS, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT BELONG WITH IT; AND FOR THIS ONE MUST HAVE AT ONE‚ÄÔS FINGER TIPS THE TOPOGRAPHY OF VARIOUS NOOKS AND THE DIFFICULT AREAS OF WHOLE SCIENCES AND ABOVE ALL OF PHILOSOPHY.

FINALLY, I SPEAK ONLY OF WHAT I HAVE LIVED THROUGH, NOT MERELY OF WHAT I HAVE THOUGHT THROUGH; THE OPPOSITION OF THINKING AND LIFE IS LACKING IN MY CASE. MY ‚ÄÚTHEORY‚ÄÙ GROWS FROM MY ‚ÄÚPRACTICE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎOH, FROM A PRACTICE THAT IS NOT BY ANY MEANS HARMLESS OR UNPROBLEMATIC!

IN HIS POSTSCRIPT TO THE FIRST EDITION, 1908, RAOUL RICHTER SAID: ‚ÄÚA PAGE THAT, ACCORDING TO INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM FRAU F√∂RSTER-NIETZSCHE, WAS MAILED TO PARAGUAY, WITH A NOTATION REGARDING ITS INSERTION IN ECCE HOMO, SURVIVES IN A COPY AND CONTAINS INVECTIVE AGAINST HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW AND FRIENDS, BUT HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM PUBLICATION HERE AS SOMETHING NOT BELONGING TO THE AUTHENTIC NIETZSCHE. THIS IS PRESUMABLY ONE OF THOSE VIOLENT OUTPOURINGS OF WHICH SEVERAL HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE F√∂RSTER PAPERS, SOME OF THEM LONG DESTROYED, WITH UNINHIBITED ATTACKS ON BISMARCK, THE KAISER, AND OTHERS. THE FACT ALONE THAT AN ADDITION TO ECCE HOMO WAS SENT TO SOUTH AMERICA [WHERE THE SISTER AND BROTHER-IN-LAW WERE THEN LIVING], INSTEAD OF BEING SENT TO THE PUBLISHER IN LEIPZIG, SHOWS THAT THIS IS PRESUMABLY A PAGE THAT BELONGS TO THE FIRST DAYS OF THE COLLAPSE. POSSIBLY, A SIMILAR BUT NO LONGER EXTANT NOTE SENT TO THE PUBLISHER WAS ALSO INTENDED FOR ECCE.‚ÄÙ PODACH‚ÄÔS CRITICISM OF RICHTER FOR NOT PUBLISHING THIS NOTE (FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHES WERKE.) SEEMS HIGHLY UNREASONABLE; BUT THE TEXT (P. 314) DESERVES INCLUSION IN THIS APPENDIX. NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS NOTATION READ: ‚ÄÚTO BE INSERTED IN THE CHAPTER ‚ÄÒTHE CASE OF WAGNER,‚ÄÔ SECTION 4, AFTER THE WORDS: ‚ÄÒEXCEPT FOR MY ASSOCIATION WITH A FEW ARTISTS, ABOVE ALL WITH RICHARD WAGNER, I HAVE NOT SPENT ONE GOOD HOUR WITH A GERMAN‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ (IBID.). THE TEXT ITSELF READS:





SHALL I HERE DIVULGE MY ‚ÄÚGERMAN‚ÄÙ EXPERIENCES?‚ÄÎF√∂RSTER: LONG LEGS, BLUE EYES, BLOND (STRAW HEAD!), A ‚ÄÚRACIAL GERMAN‚ÄÙ WHO WITH POISON AND GALL ATTACKS EVERYTHING THAT GUARANTEES SPIRIT AND FUTURE: JUDAISM, VIVISECTION, ETC.‚ÄÎBUT FOR HIS SAKE MY SISTER LEFT THOSE NEAREST HER1 AND PLUNGED INTO A WORLD FULL OF DANGERS AND EVIL ACCIDENTS.

OVERBECK3 DRIED UP, BECOME SOUR, SUBJECT TO HIS WIFE, HANDS ME, LIKE MIME,4 THE POISONED DRAFT OF DOUBT AND MISTRUST OF MYSELF‚ÄÎBUT HE SHOWS HOW HE IS FULL OF GOOD WILL TOWARD ME AND WORRIED ABOUT ME AND CALLS HIMSELF MY ‚ÄÚINDULGENT FRIEND.‚ÄÙ

ALL OF THE PARAGRAPHS IN THIS SECTION COME FROM THREE DISCARDED DRAFTS FOR THE ATTACK ON THE GERMANS IN THE CHAPTER ‚ÄÚTHE CASE OF WAGNER.‚ÄÙ (A) AND (B) CONSTITUTE THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE SAME DRAFT (PODACH, FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHES WERKE); (C) COMES FROM ANOTHER ATTEMPT (IBID.); (D) FROM THE LAST (IBID.).

(A)

AND FROM WHAT SIDE DID ALL GREAT OBSTRUCTIONS, ALL CALAMITIES IN MY LIFE EMANATE? ALWAYS FROM GERMANS. THE DAMNABLE GERMAN ANTI-SEMITISM, THIS POISONOUS BOIL OF N√©VROSE NATIONALE, HAS INTRUDED INTO MY EXISTENCE ALMOST RUINOUSLY DURING THAT DECISIVE TIME WHEN NOT MY DESTINY BUT THE DESTINY OF HUMANITY WAS AT ISSUE. AND I OWE IT TO THE SAME ELEMENT THAT MY ZARATHUSTRA ENTERED THIS WORLD AS INDECENT LITERATURE‚ÄÎITS PUBLISHER BEING AN ANTI-SEMITE. IN VAIN DO I LOOK FOR SOME SIGN OF TACT, OF D√©LICATESSE, IN RELATION TO ME: FROM JEWS, YES; NEVER YET FROM GERMANS.



(B)

THE GERMANS ARE BY FAR THE WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE; FOR SIXTEEN YEARS NOW ONE HAS LEFT ME IN THE LURCH, NOT ONLY CONCERNING MY PHILOSOPHY BUT ALSO IN REGARD TO MY HONOR. WHAT RESPECT CAN I HAVE FOR THE GERMANS WHEN EVEN MY FRIENDS CANNOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN ME AND A LIAR LIKE RICHARD WAGNER? IN ONE EXTREME CASE, ONE EVEN STRADDLES THE FENCE BETWEEN ME AND ANTI-SEMITIC CANAILLE.‚ÄÎ AND THIS AT A MOMENT WHEN AN INDESCRIBABLE RESPONSIBILITY WEIGHS ON ME‚ÄÎ1



(C)

IT SEEMS TO BE THAT ASSOCIATION WITH GERMANS EVEN CORRUPTS ONE‚ÄÔS CHARACTER. I LOSE ALL MISTRUST; I FEEL HOW THE FUNGUS OF NEIGHBOR-LOVE SPREADS IN ME‚ÄÎIT HAS EVEN HAPPENED, TO MY PROFOUND HUMILIATION, THAT I HAVE BECOME GOOD-NATURED. IS IT POSSIBLE TO SINK ANY LOWER?‚ÄÎFOR WITH ME, MALICE BELONGS TO HAPPINESS‚ÄÎI AM NO GOOD WHEN I AM NOT MALICIOUS2‚ÄÎI FIND NO SMALL JUSTIFICATION OF EXISTENCE IN PROVOKING TREMENDOUS STUPIDITIES AGAINST ME.

(D)

I AM SOLITUDE BECOME MAN.3‚ÄÎTHAT NO WORD EVER REACHED ME, FORCED ME TO REACH MYSELF.‚ÄÎI SHOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT A COUNTERTYPE OF RACE, WITHOUT GERMANS, WITHOUT THESE GERMANS, WITHOUT BISMARCK, WITHOUT 1848, WITHOUT ‚ÄÚWARS OF LIBERATION,‚ÄÙ WITHOUT KANT, EVEN WITHOUT LUTHER.‚ÄÎTHE GREAT CRIMES COMMITTED AGAINST CULTURE BY THE GERMANS ARE JUSTIFIED IN A HIGHER ECONOMY OF CULTURE.‚ÄÎI WANT NOTHING DIFFERENTLY, NOT BACKWARD EITHER‚ÄÎI WAS NOT PERMITTED TO WANT ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY.‚ÄÎAMOR FATI.‚ÄÎEVEN CHRISTIANITY BECOMES NECESSARY: ONLY THE HIGHEST FORM, THE MOST DANGEROUS, THE ONE THAT WAS MOST SEDUCTIVE IN ITS NO TO LIFE, PROVOKES ITS HIGHEST AFFIRMATION‚ÄÎME.‚ÄÎWHAT IN THE END ARE THESE TWO MILLENNIA? OUR MOST INSTRUCTIVE EXPERIMENT, A VIVISECTION OF LIFE ITSELF.‚ÄÎMERELY TWO MILLENNIA!‚ÄÎ

FOR A TIME, NIETZSCHE THOUGHT OF CONCLUDING ECCE HOMO WITH TWO SECTIONS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN A TABLE OF CONTENTS REPRODUCED PHOTOGRAPHICALLY BY PODACH (FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHES WERKE, PLATE XIV); BUT THEN HE WROTE ON A SEPARATE SHEET (IBID.): ‚ÄÚTHE SECTION DECLARATION OF WAR IS TO BE OMITTED‚ÄÎALSO THE HAMMER SPEAKS.‚ÄÙ THE LATTER HE MOVED TO THE END OF TWILIGHT (PORTABLE NIETZSCHE); THE FORMER IS LOST, EXCEPT FOR THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH ON A SHEET WITH THE NOTATION: ‚ÄÚAT THE END, AFTER THE DECLARATION OF WAR‚ÄÙ (IBID.).

FINAL CONSIDERATION

IF WE COULD DISPENSE WITH WARS, SO MUCH THE BETTER. I CAN IMAGINE MORE PROFITABLE USES FOR THE TWELVE BILLION NOW PAID ANNUALLY FOR THE ARMED PEACE WE HAVE IN EUROPE; THERE ARE OTHER MEANS OF WINNING RESPECT FOR PHYSIOLOGY THAN FIELD HOSPITALS.‚ÄÎGOOD; VERY GOOD EVEN: SINCE THE OLD GOD IS ABOLISHED, I AM PREPARED TO RULE THE WORLD‚ÄÎ

NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS WORKS ARE GENERALLY CITED BY SECTION NUMBERS, AS THESE ARE THE SAME IN ALL EDITIONS.

THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA, TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS, AND NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER ARE NOT COMPOSED OF CONSECUTIVELY NUMBERED SECTIONS; BUT THEY ARE AVAILABLE IN A SINGLE VOLUME, ALONG WITH THE ANTICHRIST AND SELECTIONS FROM NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS OTHER BOOKS, FROM HIS NOTES, AND FROM HIS LETTERS: THE PORTABLE NIETZSCHE, SELECTED AND TRANSLATED, WITH AN INTRODUCTION, PREFACES, AND NOTES, BY WALTER KAUFMANN, THE VIKING PRESS, NEW YORK, 1954. PAGE NUMBERS REFER TO THIS VOLUME.

WALTER KAUFMANN, NIETZSCHE: PHILOSOPHER, PSYCHOLOGIST, ANTICHRIST WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED BY THE PRINCETON UNIVERSITY PRESS IN 1950. THE PAGINATION OF THE REVISED PAPERBACK EDITION, PUBLISHED BY MERIDIAN BOOKS, NEW YORK, 1956, WAS DIFFERENT, AND THAT OF THE THIRD, REVISED AND GREATLY ENLARGED EDITION (PRINCETON UNIVERSITY PRESS AND RANDOM HOUSE, VINTAGE BOOKS, 1968) IS DIFFERENT AGAIN. THE BOOK IS THEREFORE CITED NOT BY PAGES BUT BY CHAPTERS AND SECTIONS. THE THIRD EDITION CONTAINS A COMPREHENSIVE BIBLIOGRAPHY THAT INCLUDES NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS BOOKS, COLLECTED EDITIONS, MATERIAL NOT INCLUDED IN THESE, HIS CORRESPONDENCE IN GERMAN, ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS, AND WORKS ABOUT NIETZSCHE BY OVER A HUNDRED AUTHORS.

[THE] WORD NIHILISM CAME INTO VOGUE THROUGH TURGENIEV AS A NAME FOR THE NOTION THAT ONLY WHAT IS PERCEPTIBLE TO OUR SENSES, THAT IS, ONLY BEINGS THAT ONE EXPERIENCES ONESELF, ONLY THESE AND NOTHING ELSE ARE REAL AND HAVE BEING. THEREFORE, ANYTHING GROUNDED ON TRADITION, AUTHORITY, OR ANY OTHER DEFINITIVE VALUE IS NEGATED. USUALLY, HOWEVER, THE NAME POSITIVISM IS USED TO DESIGNATE THIS POINT OF VIEW.

FOR NIETZSCHE, THOUGH, THE WORD NIHILISM MEANS SOMETHING SUBSTANTIALLY ‚ÄÚMORE.‚ÄÙ NIETZSCHE SPEAKS ABOUT ‚ÄÚEUROPEAN NIHILISM.‚ÄÙ HE DOES NOT MEAN THE POSITIVISM THAT AROSE IN THE MID-NINETEENTH CENTURY AND SPREAD THROUGHOUT EUROPE. ‚ÄÚEUROPEAN‚ÄÙ HAS A HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE HERE, AND MEANS AS MUCH AS ‚ÄÚWESTERN‚ÄÙ IN THE SENSE OF WESTERN HISTORY. NIETZSCHE USES NIHILISM AS THE NAME FOR THE HISTORICAL MOVEMENT THAT HE WAS THE FIRST TO RECOGNIZE AND THAT ALREADY GOVERNED THE PREVIOUS CENTURY WHILE DEFINING THE CENTURY TO COME, THE MOVEMENT WHOSE ESSENTIAL INTERPRETATION HE CONCENTRATES IN THE TERSE SENTENCE: ‚ÄÚGOD IS DEAD.‚ÄÙ THAT IS TO SAY, THE ‚ÄÚCHRISTIAN GOD‚ÄÙ HAS LOST HIS POWER OVER BEINGS AND OVER THE DETERMINATION OF MAN. ‚ÄÚCHRISTIAN GOD‚ÄÙ ALSO STANDS FOR THE ‚ÄÚTRANSCENDENT‚ÄÙ IN GENERAL IN ITS VARIOUS MEANINGS‚ÄÎFOR ‚ÄÚIDEALS‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚNORMS,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚPRINCIPLES‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚRULES,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚENDS‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚVALUES,‚ÄÙ WHICH ARE SET ‚ÄÚABOVE‚ÄÙ THE BEING, IN ORDER TO GIVE BEING AS A WHOLE A PURPOSE, AN ORDER, AND‚ÄÎAS IT IS SUCCINTLY EXPRESSED‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚMEANING.‚ÄÙ NIHILISM IS THAT HISTORICAL PROCESS WHEREBY THE DOMINANCE OF THE ‚ÄÚTRANSCENDENT‚ÄÙ BECOMES NULL AND VOID, SO THAT ALL BEING LOSES ITS WORTH AND MEANING. NIHILISM IS THE HISTORY OF THE BEING ITSELF, THROUGH WHICH THE DEATH OF THE CHRISTIAN GOD COMES SLOWLY BUT INEXORABLY TO LIGHT. IT MAY BE THAT THIS GOD WILL CONTINUE TO BE BELIEVED IN, AND THAT HIS WORLD WILL BE TAKEN AS ‚ÄÚREAL,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚEFFECTUAL,‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚDETERMINATIVE.‚ÄÙ THIS HISTORY RESEMBLES THE PROCESS IN WHICH THE LIGHT OF A STAR THAT HAS BEEN EXTINGUISHED FOR MILLENNIA STILL GLEAMS, BUT IN ITS GLEAMING NONETHELESS REMAINS A MERE ‚ÄÚAPPEARANCE.‚ÄÙ FOR NIETZSCHE, THEREFORE, NIHILISM IS IN NO WAY SOME KIND OF VIEWPOINT ‚ÄÚPUT FORWARD‚ÄÙ BY SOMEBODY, NOR IS IT AN ARBITRARY HISTORICAL ‚ÄÚGIVEN,‚ÄÙ AMONG MANY OTHERS, THAT CAN BE HISTORICALLY DOCUMENTED. NIHILISM IS, RATHER, THAT EVENT OF LONG DURATION IN WHICH THE TRUTH OF BEING AS A WHOLE IS ESSENTIALLY TRANSFORMED AND DRIVEN TOWARD AN END THAT SUCH TRUTH HAS DETERMINED.

THE TRUTH OF BEING AS A WHOLE HAS LONG BEEN CALLED METAPHYSICS. EVERY ERA, EVERY HUMAN EPOCH, IS SUSTAINED BY SOME METAPHYSICS AND IS PLACED THEREBY IN A DEFINITE RELATION TO BEING AS A WHOLE AND ALSO TO ITSELF. THE END OF METAPHYSICS DISCLOSES ITSELF AS THE COLLAPSE OF THE REIGN OF THE TRANSCENDENT AND THE ‚ÄÚIDEAL‚ÄÙ THAT SPRANG FROM IT. BUT THE END OF METAPHYSICS DOES NOT MEAN THE CESSATION OF HISTORY. IT IS THE BEGINNING OF A SERIOUS CONCERN WITH THAT ‚ÄÚEVENT‚ÄÙ: ‚ÄÚGOD IS DEAD.‚ÄÙ THAT BEGINNING IS ALREADY UNDER WAY. NIETZSCHE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD HIS PHILOSOPHY AS AN INTRODUCTION TO THE BEGINNING OF A NEW AGE. HE ENVISIONED THE COMING CENTURY‚ÄÎTHAT IS, THE CURRENT, TWENTIETH CENTURY‚ÄÎAS THE START OF AN ERA WHOSE UPHEAVALS COULD NOT BE COMPARED TO ANYTHING PREVIOUSLY KNOWN. ALTHOUGH THE SCENERY OF THE WORLD THEATER MIGHT REMAIN THE SAME FOR A TIME, THE PLAY IN PERFORMANCE WOULD ALREADY BE A DIFFERENT ONE. THE FACT THAT EARLIER AIMS NOW DISAPPEAR AND FORMER VALUES ARE DEVALUED IS NO LONGER EXPERIENCED AS SHEER ANNIHILATION AND DEPLORED AS WASTEFUL AND WRONG, BUT IS RATHER GREETED AS A LIBERATION, TOUTED AS AN IRREVOCABLE GAIN, AND PERCEIVED AS A FULFILLMENT.

‚ÄÚNIHILISM‚ÄÙ IS THE INCREASINGLY DOMINANT TRUTH THAT ALL PRIOR AIMS OF BEING HAVE BECOME SUPERFLUOUS. BUT WITH THIS TRANSFORMATION OF THE ERSTWHILE RELATION TO RULING VALUES, NIHILISM HAS ALSO PERFECTED ITSELF FOR THE FREE AND GENUINE TASK OF A NEW VALUATION. SUCH NIHILISM, WHICH IS IN ITSELF PERFECTED AND IS DECISIVE FOR THE FUTURE, MAY BE CHARACTERIZED AS ‚ÄÚCLASSICAL NIHILISM.‚ÄÙ NIETZSCHE DESCRIBES HIS OWN ‚ÄÚMETAPHYSICS‚ÄÙ WITH THIS NAME AND CONCEIVES IT TO BE THE COUNTERSTROKE TO ALL PRECEDING METAPHYSICS. THE NAME NIHILISM THUS LOSES THE PURELY NIHILISTIC SENSE IN WHICH IT MEANS A DESTRUCTION AND ANNIHILATION OF PREVIOUS VALUES, THE MERE NEGATION OF BEINGS AND THE FUTILITY OF HUMAN HISTORY.

‚ÄÚNIHILISM,‚ÄÙ THOUGHT NOW IN ITS CLASSIC SENSE, CALLS FOR FREEDOM FROM VALUES AS FREEDOM FOR A REVALUATION OF ALL (SUCH) VALUES. NIETZSCHE USES THE EXPRESSION ‚ÄÚREVALUATION OF ALL VALUES HITHERTO‚ÄÙ ALONGSIDE THE KEY WORD NIHILISM AS ANOTHER MAJOR RUBRIC BY WHICH HE ASSIGNS HIS OWN FUNDAMENTAL METAPHYSICAL POSITION ITS DEFINITE PLACE WITHIN THE HISTORY OF WESTERN METAPHYSICS.

FROM THE RUBRIC ‚ÄÚREVALUATION OF VALUES,‚ÄÙ WE EXPECT THAT ALTERED VALUES WILL BE POSITED IN PLACE OF EARLIER ONES. BUT FOR NIETZSCHE ‚ÄÚREVALUATION‚ÄÙ MEANS THAT THE VERY ‚ÄÚPLACE‚ÄÙ FOR PREVIOUS VALUES DISAPPEARS, NOT MERELY THAT THE VALUES THEMSELVES FALL AWAY. THIS IMPLIES THAT THE NATURE AND DIRECTION OF VALUATION, AND THE DEFINITION OF THE ESSENCE OF VALUE ARE TRANSFORMED. THE REVALUATION THINKS BEING FOR THE FIRST TIME AS VALUE. WITH IT, METAPHYSICS BEGINS TO BE VALUE THINKING. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS TRANSFORMATION, PRIOR VALUES DO NOT MERELY SUCCUMB TO DEVALUATION BUT, ABOVE ALL, THE NEED FOR VALUES IN THEIR FORMER SHAPE AND IN THEIR PREVIOUS PLACE‚ÄÎTHAT IS TO SAY, THEIR PLACE IN THE TRANSCENDENT‚ÄÎIS UPROOTED. THE UPROOTING OF PAST NEEDS MOST ASSUREDLY TAKES PLACE BY CULTIVATING THE GROWING IGNORANCE OF PAST VALUES AND BY OBLITERATING HISTORY THROUGH A REVISION OF ITS BASIC TRAITS. ‚ÄÚREVALUATION OF PRIOR VALUES‚ÄÙ IS PRIMARILY THE METAMORPHOSIS OF ALL VALUATION HERETOFORE AND THE ‚ÄÚBREEDING‚ÄÙ OF A NEW NEED FOR VALUES.

IF SUCH REVALUATION OF ALL PRIOR VALUES IS NOT ONLY TO BE CARRIED OUT BUT IS ALSO TO BE GROUNDED, THEN IT HAS NEED OF A ‚ÄÚNEW PRINCIPLE;‚ÄÙ THAT IS, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A BASIS FOR DEFINING BEINGS AS A WHOLE IN A NEW, AUTHORITATIVE WAY. BUT IF THE INTERPRETATION OF BEINGS AS A WHOLE CANNOT ISSUE FROM A TRANSCENDENT THAT IS POSITED ‚ÄÚOVER‚ÄÙ THEM FROM THE OUTSET, THEN THE NEW VALUES AND THEIR STANDARD OF MEASURE CAN ONLY BE DRAWN FROM THE REALM OF BEINGS THEMSELVES. THUS BEINGS THEMSELVES REQUIRE A NEW INTERPRETATION THROUGH WHICH THEIR BASIC CHARACTER MAY BE DEFINED IN A WAY THAT WILL MAKE IT FIT TO SERVE AS A ‚ÄÚPRINCIPLE‚ÄÙ FOR THE INSCRIPTION OF A NEW TABLE OF VALUES AND AS A STANDARD OF MEASURE FOR SUITABLY RANKING SUCH VALUES.

IF THE ESSENCE OF METAPHYSICS CONSISTS IN GROUNDING THE TRUTH OF BEING AS A WHOLE, THEN THE REVALUATION OF ALL VALUES, AS A GROUNDING OF THE PRINCIPLE FOR A NEW VALUATION, IS ITSELF METAPHYSICS. WHAT NIETZSCHE PERCEIVES AND POSITS AS THE BASIC CHARACTER OF BEING AS A WHOLE IS WHAT HE CALLS THE ‚ÄÚWILL TO POWER.‚ÄÙ THAT CONCEPT DOES NOT MERELY DELIMIT WHAT A BEING IN ITS BEING IS: NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS PHRASE, ‚ÄÚWILL TO POWER,‚ÄÙ WHICH HAS IN MANY WAYS BECOME FAMILIAR, CONTAINS HIS INTERPRETATION OF THE ESSENCE OF POWER. EVERY POWER IS A POWER ONLY AS LONG AS IT IS MORE POWER; THAT IS TO SAY, AN INCREASE IN POWER. POWER CAN MAINTAIN ITSELF IN ITSELF, THAT IS, IN ITS ESSENCE, ONLY IF IT OVERTAKES AND OVERCOMES THE POWER LEVEL IT HAS ALREADY ATTAINED‚ÄÎOVERPOWERING IS THE EXPRESSION WE USE. AS SOON AS POWER STALLS AT A CERTAIN POWER LEVEL, IT IMMEDIATELY BECOMES POWERLESS. ‚ÄÚWILL TO POWER‚ÄÙ DOES NOT MEAN SIMPLY THE ‚ÄÚROMANTIC‚ÄÙ YEARNING AND QUEST FOR POWER BY THOSE WHO HAVE NO POWER; RATHER, ‚ÄÚWILL TO POWER‚ÄÙ MEANS THE ACCRUING OF POWER BY POWER FOR ITS OWN OVERPOWERING.

‚ÄÚWILL TO POWER‚ÄÙ IS A SINGLE NAME FOR THE BASIC CHARACTER OF BEINGS AND FOR THE ESSENCE OF POWER. NIETZSCHE OFTEN SUBSTITUTES ‚ÄÚFORCE‚ÄÙ FOR ‚ÄÚWILL TO POWER‚ÄÙ IN A WAY THAT IS EASILY MISUNDERSTOOD. HIS CONCEPTION OF THE BASIC CHARACTER OF BEINGS AS WILL TO POWER IS NOT THE CONTRIVANCE OR WHIM OF A FANTAST WHO HAS STRAYED OFF OF CHASE CHIMERAS. IT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL EXPERIENCE OF A THINKER; THAT IS, OF ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO FIND WORDS FOR WHAT A BEING IS IN THE HISTORY OF ITS BEING. EVERY BEING, INSOFAR AS IT IS, AND IS AS IT IS, IS ‚ÄÚWILL TO POWER.‚ÄÙ THE PHRASE NAMES THAT FROM WHICH ALL VALUATION PROCEEDS AND TO WHICH IT RETURNS. HOWEVER, AS WE HAVE SAID, THE NEW VALUATION IS NOT A ‚ÄÚREVALUATION OF ALL PRIOR VALUES‚ÄÙ MERELY IN THAT IT SUPPLANTS ALL EARLIER VALUES WITH POWER, THE UPPERMOST VALUE, BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST BECAUSE POWER AND ONLY POWER POSITS VALUES, VALIDATES THEM, AND MAKES DECISIONS ABOUT THE POSSIBLE JUSTIFICATIONS OF A VALUATION. IF ALL BEING IS WILL TO POWER, THEN ONLY WHAT IS FULFILLED IN ITS ESSENCE BY POWER ‚ÄÚHAS‚ÄÙ VALUE OR ‚ÄÚIS‚ÄÙ A VALUE. BUT POWER IS POWER ONLY AS ENHANCEMENT OF POWER. TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS TRULY POWER, ALONE DETERMINING ALL BEINGS, POWER DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE WORTH OR VALUE OF ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF ITSELF. THAT IS WHY WILL TO POWER AS A PRINCIPLE FOR THE NEW VALUATION TOLERATES NO END OUTSIDE OF BEING AS A WHOLE. NOW, BECAUSE ALL BEINGS AS WILL TO POWER‚ÄÎTHAT IS, AS INCESSANT SELF-OVERPOWERING‚ÄÎMUST BE A CONTINUAL ‚ÄÚBECOMING,‚ÄÙ AND BECAUSE SUCH ‚ÄÚBECOMING‚ÄÙ CANNOT MOVE ‚ÄÚTOWARD AN END‚ÄÙ OUTSIDE ITS OWN ‚ÄÚFARTHER AND FARTHER,‚ÄÙ BUT IS CEASELESSLY CAUGHT UP IN THE CYCLICAL INCREASE OF POWER TO WHICH IT REVERTS, THEN BEING AS A WHOLE TOO, AS THIS POWER-CONFORMING BECOMING, MUST ITSELF ALWAYS RECUR AGAIN AND BRING BACK THE SAME.

HENCE, THE BASIC CHARACTER OF BEINGS AS WILL TO POWER IS ALSO DEFINED AS ‚ÄÚTHE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF THE SAME.‚ÄÙ THE LATTER CONSTITUTES YET ANOTHER MAJOR RUBRIC IN NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS METAPHYSICS AND, MOREOVER, IMPLIES SOMETHING ESSENTIAL: ONLY THROUGH THE ADEQUATELY CONCEIVED ESSENCE OF WILL TO POWER CAN IT BECOME CLEAR WHY THE BEING OF BEINGS AS A WHOLE MUST BE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF THE SAME. THE REVERSE HOLDS AS WELL: ONLY THROUGH THE ESSENCE OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF THE SAME CAN THE INNERMOST CORE OF WILL TO POWER AND ITS NECESSITY BE GRASPED. THE PHRASE ‚ÄÚWILL TO POWER‚ÄÙ TELLS WHAT BEINGS ARE IN THEIR ‚ÄÚESSENCE‚ÄÙ (IN THEIR CONSTITUTION). THE PHRASE ‚ÄÚETERNAL RECURRENCE OF THE SAME‚ÄÙ TELLS HOW BEINGS OF SUCH AN ESSENCE MUST AS A WHOLE BE.

IT REMAINS FOR US TO OBSERVE WHAT IS DECISIVE HERE; NAMELY, THAT NIETZSCHE HAD TO THINK THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF THE SAME BEFORE THE WILL TO POWER. THE MOST ESSENTIAL THOUGHT IS THOUGHT FIRST.

WHEN NIETZSCHE HIMSELF INSISTS THAT BEING, AS ‚ÄÚLIFE,‚ÄÙ IS IN ESSENCE ‚ÄÚBECOMING‚ÄÙ HE DOES NOT INTEND THE ROUGHLY DEFINED CONCEPT OF ‚ÄÚBECOMING‚ÄÙ TO MEAN EITHER AN ENDLESS, CONTINUAL PROGRESSION TO SOME UNKNOWN GOAL, NOR IS HE THINKING ABOUT THE CONFUSED TURMOIL AND TUMULT OF UNRESTRAINED DRIVES. THE VAGUE AND HACKNEYED TERM BECOMING SIGNIFIES THE OVERPOWERING OF POWER, AS THE ESSENCE OF POWER, WHICH POWERFULLY AND CONTINUALLY RETURNS TO ITSELF IN ITS OWN WAY.

AT THE SAME TIME, THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF THE SAME OFFERS THE KEENEST INTERPRETATION OF ‚ÄÚCLASSICAL NIHILISM,‚ÄÙ WHICH ABSOLUTELY OBLITERATES ANY END ABOVE AND BEYOND BEINGS. FOR SUCH NIHILISM, THE WORDS ‚ÄÚGOD IS DEAD‚ÄÙ SUGGEST THE IMPOTENCE NOT ONLY OF THE CHRISTIAN GOD BUT OF EVERY TRANSCENDENT ELEMENT UNDER WHICH MEN MIGHT WANT TO SHELTER THEMSELVES. AND THAT IMPOTENCE SIGNIFIES THE COLLAPSE OF THE OLD ORDER.

WITH THE REVALUATION OF ALL PAST VALUES, AN UNRESTRICTED CHALLENGE HAS BEEN ISSUED TO MEN: THAT UNCONDITIONALLY FROM, THROUGH, AND OVER THEMSELVES, THEY RAISE ‚ÄÚNEW STANDARDS‚ÄÙ UNDER WHICH THE ACCOMMODATION OF BEING AS A WHOLE TO A NEW ORDER MUST BE EFFECTED. BECAUSE THE ‚ÄÚTRANSCENDENT,‚ÄÙ THE ‚ÄÚBEYOND,‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚHEAVEN‚ÄÙ HAVE BEEN ABOLISHED, ONLY THE ‚ÄÚEARTH‚ÄÙ REMAINS. THE NEW ORDER MUST THEREFORE BE THE ABSOLUTE DOMINANCE OF PURE POWER OVER THE EARTH THROUGH MAN‚ÄÎNOT THROUGH ANY ARBITRARY KIND OF MAN, AND CERTAINLY NOT THROUGH THE HUMANITY THAT HAS HERETOFORE LIVED UNDER THE OLD VALUES. THROUGH WHAT KIND OF MAN, THEN?

WITH NIHILISM‚ÄÎTHAT IS TO SAY, WITH THE REVALUATION OF ALL PRIOR VALUES AMONG BEINGS AS WILL TO POWER AND IN LIGHT OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF THE SAME‚ÄÎIT BECOMES NECESSARY TO POSIT A NEW ESSENCE FOR MAN. BUT, BECAUSE ‚ÄÚGOD IS DEAD,‚ÄÙ ONLY MAN HIMSELF CAN GRANT MAN HIS MEASURE AND CENTER, THE ‚ÄÚTYPE‚ÄÙ THE ‚ÄÚMODEL‚ÄÙ OF A CERTAIN KIND OF MAN WHO HAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF A REVALUATION OF ALL VALUES TO THE INDIVIDUAL POWER OF HIS WILL TO POWER AND WHO IS PREPARED TO EMBARK ON THE ABSOLUTE DOMINATION OF THE GLOBE. CLASSICAL NIHILISM, WHICH AS THE REVALUATION OF ALL VALUES HITHERTO UNDERSTANDS BEINGS AS WILL TO POWER AND CAN ADMIT ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF THE SAME AS THE SOLE ‚ÄÚEND,‚ÄÙ MUST TAKE MAN HIMSELF‚ÄÎTHAT IS, MAN AS HE HAS BEEN UNTIL NOW‚ÄÎOUT OF AND ‚ÄÚOVER‚ÄÙ HIMSELF AND MUST FASHION AS HIS MEASURE THE FIGURE OF THE ‚ÄÚOVERMAN.‚ÄÙ

FROM NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS POINT OF VIEW, THE OVERMAN IS NOT MEANT TO BE A MERE AMPLIFICATION OF PRIOR MAN, BUT THE MOST UNEQUIVOCALLY SINGULAR FORM OF HUMAN EXISTENCE THAT, AS ABSOLUTE WILL TO POWER, IS BROUGHT TO POWER IN EVERY MAN TO SOME DEGREE AND THAT THEREBY GRANTS HIM HIS MEMBERSHIP IN BEING AS A WHOLE‚ÄÎTHAT IS, IN WILL TO POWER‚ÄÎAND THAT SHOWS HIM TO BE A TRUE ‚ÄÚBEING,‚ÄÙ CLOSE TO REALITY AND ‚ÄÚLIFE.‚ÄÙ THE OVERMAN SIMPLY LEAVES THE MAN OF TRADITIONAL VALUES BEHIND, OVERTAKES HIM, AND TRANSFERS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR ALL LAWS AND THE POSITING OF ALL VALUES TO THE EMPOWERING OF POWER. AN ACT OR ACCOMPLISHMENT IS VALID AS SUCH ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT IT SERVES TO EQUIP, NURTURE, AND ENHANCE WILL TO POWER.

THE FIVE MAIN RUBRICS WE HAVE MENTIONED‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚNIHILISM,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚREVALUATION OF ALL VALUES HITHERTO,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚWILL TO POWER,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚETERNAL RECURRENCE OF THE SAME,‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚOVERMAN‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎEACH PORTRAYS NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS METAPHYSICS FROM JUST ONE PERSPECTIVE, ALTHOUGH IN EACH CASE IT IS A PERSPECTIVE THAT DEFINES THE WHOLE. THUS NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS METAPHYSICS IS GRASPED ONLY WHEN WHAT IS NAMED IN THESE FIVE HEADINGS CAN BE THOUGHT‚ÄÎTHAT IS, ESSENTIALLY EXPERIENCED‚ÄÎIN ITS PRIMORDIAL AND HERETOFORE MERELY INTIMATED CONJUNCTION. WE CAN LEARN WHAT ‚ÄÚNIHILISM‚ÄÙ IN NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS SENSE IS ONLY IF WE ALSO COMPREHEND, IN THEIR CONTEXTS, ‚ÄÚREVALUATION OF ALL VALUES HITHERTO,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚWILL TO POWER,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚETERNAL RECURRENCE OF THE SAME,‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚOVERMAN.‚ÄÙ BY STARTING FROM AN ADEQUATE COMPREHENSION OF NIHILISM AND WORKING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, WE CAN ALSO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE ESSENCE OF REVALUATION, THE ESSENCE OF WILL TO POWER, THE ESSENCE OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF THE SAME, AND THE ESSENCE OF THE OVERMAN. BUT TO HAVE SUCH KNOWLEDGE IS TO STAND WITHIN THE MOMENT THAT THE HISTORY OF BEING HAS OPENED UP FOR OUR AGE.

THE NECESSITY OF HAVING TO THINK THE ESSENCE OF ‚ÄÚNIHILISM‚ÄÙ IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ‚ÄÚREVALUATION OF ALL VALUES,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚWILL TO POWER,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚETERNAL RECURRENCE OF THE SAME,‚ÄÙ AND THE ‚ÄÚOVERMAN‚ÄÙ LETS US READILY SURMISE THAT THE ESSENCE OF NIHILISM IS IN ITSELF MANIFOLD, MULTILEVELED, AND MULTIFARIOUS. THE WORD NIHILISM THEREFORE PERMITS MANY APPLICATIONS. IT CAN BE MISUSED AS AN EMPTY SLOGAN OR EPITHET THAT BOTH REPELS AND DISCREDITS AND THAT CONCEALS THE USER‚ÄÔS OWN THOUGHTLESSNESS FROM HIM. BUT WE CAN ALSO EXPERIENCE THE FULL BURDEN OF WHAT THE NAME SAYS WHEN UTTERED IN NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS SENSE. HERE IT MEANS TO THINK THE HISTORY OF WESTERN METAPHYSICS AS THE GROUND OF OUR OWN HISTORY; THAT IS, OF FUTURE DECISIONS. FINALLY, WE CAN PONDER MORE ESSENTIALLY WHAT NIETZSCHE WAS THINKING IN USING THIS WORD IF WE GRASP HIS ‚ÄÚCLASSICAL NIHILISM‚ÄÙ AS THAT NIHILISM WHOSE ‚ÄÚCLASSICISM‚ÄÙ CONSISTS IN THE FACT THAT IT MUST UNWITTINGLY PUT ITSELF ON EXTREME GUARD AGAINST KNOWLEDGE OF ITS INNERMOST ESSENCE. CLASSICAL NIHILISM, THEN, DISCLOSES ITSELF AS THE FULFILLMENT OF NIHILISM, WHEREBY IT CONSIDERS ITSELF EXEMPT FROM THE NECESSITY OF THINKING ABOUT THE VERY THING THAT CONSTITUTES ITS ESSENCE: THE NIHIL, THE NOTHING‚ÄÎAS THE VEIL THAT CONCEALS THE TRUTH OF THE BEING OF BEINGS.

WITH NIETZSCHE, NIHILISM SEEMS TO BECOME PROPHETIC. BUT WE CAN DRAW NO CONCLUSIONS FROM NIETZSCHE, EXCEPT THE BASE AND MEDIOCRE CRUELTY THAT HE HATED WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH, UNLESS WE GIVE FIRST PLACE IN HIS WORK‚ÄÎWELL AHEAD OF THE PROPHET‚ÄÎTO THE DIAGNOSTICIAN. THE PROVISIONAL, METHODICAL, STRATEGIC CHARACTER OF HIS THOUGHT CANNOT BE DOUBTED FOR A MOMENT. WITH HIM, NIHILISM BECOMES CONSCIOUS FOR THE FIRST TIME. DIAGNOSTICIANS HAVE THIS IN COMMON WITH PROPHETS‚ÄÎTHEY THINK AND OPERATE IN TERMS OF THE FUTURE. NIETZSCHE NEVER THOUGHT EXCEPT IN TERMS OF AN APOCALYPSE TO COME, NOT IN ORDER TO EXTOL IT, FOR HE GUESSED THE SORDID AND CALCULATING ASPECT THAT THIS APOCALYPSE WOULD FINALLY ASSUME, BUT IN ORDER TO AVOID IT AND TO TRANSFORM IT INTO A RENAISSANCE. HE RECOGNIZED NIHILISM FOR WHAT IT WAS AND EXAMINED IT LIKE A CLINICAL FACT.

HE SAID OF HIMSELF THAT HE WAS THE FIRST COMPLETE NIHILIST OF EUROPE. NOT BY CHOICE, BUT BY CONDITION, AND BECAUSE HE WAS TOO GREAT TO REFUSE THE HERITAGE OF HIS TIME. HE DIAGNOSED IN HIMSELF, AND IN OTHERS, THE INABILITY TO BELIEVE AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE PRIMITIVE FOUNDATION OF ALL FAITH‚ÄÎNAMELY THE BELIEF IN LIFE. THE ‚ÄÚCAN ONE LIVE AS A REBEL?‚ÄÙ BECAME WITH HIM ‚ÄÚCAN ONE LIVE, BELIEVING IN NOTHING?‚ÄÙ HIS REPLY IS IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. YES, IF ONE CREATES A SYSTEM OUT OF ABSENCE OF FAITH, IF ONE ACCEPTS THE FINAL CONSEQUENCES OF NIHILISM, AND IF, ON EMERGING INTO THE DESERT AND PUTTING ONE‚ÄÔS CONFIDENCE IN WHAT IS GOING TO COME, ONE FEELS, WITH THE SAME PRIMITIVE INSTINCT, BOTH PAIN AND JOY.

[‚Ä¶]

NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS PHILOSOPHY, UNDOUBTEDLY, REVOLVES AROUND THE PROBLEM OF REBELLION. MORE PRECISELY, IT BEGINS BY BEING A REBELLION. BUT WE SENSE THE CHANGE OF POSITION THAT NIETZSCHE MAKES. WITH HIM, REBELLION BEGINS AT ‚ÄÚGOD IS DEAD‚ÄÙ WHICH IS ASSUMED AS AN ESTABLISHED FACT; THEN REBELLION HINGES ON EVERYTHING THAT AIMS AT FALSELY REPLACING THE VANISHED DEITY AND REFLECTS DISHONOUR ON A WORLD WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY HAS NO DIRECTION BUT WHICH REMAINS THE ONLY PROVING-GROUND OF THE GODS.

CONTRARY TO THE OPINION OF CERTAIN OF HIS CHRISTIAN CRITICS, NIETZSCHE DID NOT FORM A PROJECT TO KILL GOD. HE FOUND HIM DEAD IN THE SOUL OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES. HE WAS THE FIRST TO UNDERSTAND THE IMMENSE IMPORTANCE OF THE EVENT AND TO DECIDE THAT THIS REBELLION AMONG MEN COULD NOT LEAD TO A RENAISSANCE UNLESS IT WERE CONTROLLED AND DIRECTED. ANY OTHER ATTITUDE TOWARDS IT, WHETHER IT WERE REGRET OR COMPLACENCY, MUST LEAD TO THE APOCALYPSE. THUS NIETZSCHE DID NOT FORMULATE A PHILOSOPHY OF REBELLION, BUT CONSTRUCTED A PHILOSOPHY ON REBELLION.

[‚Ä¶]

IN NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS MIND, THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS TO SEE THAT THE HUMAN SPIRIT BOWED PROUDLY TO THE INEVITABLE. WE KNOW, HOWEVER, HIS POSTERITY AND THE KIND OF POLITICS THAT WERE TO BE AUTHORIZED BY THE MAN WHO CLAIMED TO BE THE LAST ANTI-POLITICAL GERMAN. HE DREAMED OF TYRANTS WHO WERE ARTISTS. BUT TYRANNY COMES MORE NATURALLY THAN ART TO MEDIOCRE MEN. ‚ÄÚRATHER CESARE BORGIA THAN PARSIFAL,‚ÄÙ HE EXLAIMED. HE BEGAT BOTH CAESAR AND BORGIA, BUT DEVOID OF THE DISTINCTION OF FEELING WHICH HE ATTRIBUTED TO THE GREAT MEN OF THE RENAISSANCE. AS A RESULT OF HIS INSISTENCE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BOW BEFORE THE ETERNITY OF THE SPECIES AND SHOULD SUBMERGE HIMSELF IN THE GREAT CYCLE OF TIME, RACE HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A SPECIAL ASPECT OF THE SPECIES AND THE INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN MADE TO BOW BEFORE THIS SORDID GOD. THE LIFE OF WHICH HE SPOKE WITH SUCH FEAR AND TREMBLING HAS BEEN DEGRADED TO A SORT OF BIOLOGY FOR DOMESTIC USE. FINALLY A RACE OF VULGAR OVERLORDS, WITH A BLUNDERING DESIRE FOR POWER, ADOPTED, IN HIS NAME, THE ‚ÄÚANTI-SEMITIC DEFORMITY‚ÄÙ ON WHICH HE NEVER CEASED TO POUR SCORN.

IN THE HISTORY OF INTELLIGENCE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MARX, NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS ADVENTURE HAS NO EQUIVALENT: WE SHALL NEVER FINISH MAKING REPARATION FOR THE INJUSTICE DONE TO HIM. OF COURSE HISTORY RECORDS OTHER PHILOSOPHIES THAT HAVE BEEN MISCONSTRUED AND BETRAYED. BUT UP TO THE TIME OF NIETZSCHE AND NATIONAL SOCIALISM, IT WAS QUITE WITHOUT PARALLEL THAT A PROCESS OF THOUGHT‚ÄÎBRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED BY THE NOBILITY AND BY THE SUFFERINGS OF AN EXCEPTIONAL MIND‚ÄÎSHOULD HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO THE EYES OF THE WORLD BY A PARADE OF LIES AND BY THE HIDEOUS ACCUMULATION OF CORPSES FROM CONCENTRATION CAMPS. THE DOCTRINE OF THE SUPERMAN LED TO THE METHODICAL CREATION OF SUBMEN‚ÄÎA FACT THAT DOUBTLESS SHOULD BE DENOUNCED BUT WHICH ALSO DEMANDS INTERPRETATION. IF THE FINAL RESULT OF THE GREAT MOVEMENT OF REBELLION IN THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURIES WAS TO BE THIS RUTHLESS BONDAGE THEN SURELY REBELLION SHOULD BE REJECTED AND NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS DESPERATE CRY TO HIS CONTEMPORARIES TAKEN UP: ‚ÄÚMY CONSCIENCE AND YOURS ARE NO LONGER THE SAME CONSCIENCE.‚ÄÙ

THE ETERNAL RETURN IS AS BADLY MISUNDERSTOOD AS THE WILL TO POWER. EVERY TIME WE UNDERSTAND THE ETERNAL RETURN AS THE RETURN OF A PARTICULAR ARRANGEMENT OF THINGS AFTER ALL THE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN REALISED, EVERY TIME WE INTERPRET THE ETERNAL RETURN AS THE RETURN OF THE IDENTICAL OR THE SAME, WE REPLACE NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS THOUGHT WITH CHILDISH HYPOTHESES. NO ONE EXTENDED THE CRITIQUE OF ALL FORMS OF IDENTITY FURTHER THAN NIETZSCHE. ON TWO OCCASIONS IN ZARATHUSTRA NIETZSCHE EXPLICITLY DENIES THAT THE ETERNAL RETURN IS A CIRCLE WHICH MAKES THE SAME RETURN. THE ETERNAL RETURN IS THE STRICT OPPOSITE OF THIS SINCE IT CANNOT BE SEPARATED FROM A SELECTION, FROM A DOUBLE SELECTION. FIRSTLY, THERE IS THE SELECTION OF WILLING OR OF THOUGHT WHICH CONSTITUTES NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS ETHICS: ONLY WILL THAT OF WHICH ONE ALSO WILLS THE ETERNAL RETURN (TO ELIMINATE ALL HALF-WILLING, EVERYTHING WHICH CAN ONLY BE WILLED WITH THE PROVISO ‚ÄÚONCE, ONLY ONCE‚ÄÙ). SECONDLY, THERE IS THE SELECTION OF BEING WHICH CONSTITUTES NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS ONTOLOGY: ONLY THAT WHICH BECOMES IN THE FULLEST SENSE OF THE WORD CAN RETURN, IS FIT TO RETURN. ONLY ACTION AND AFFIRMATION RETURN: BECOMING HAS BEING AND ONLY BECOMING HAS BEING. THAT WHICH IS OPPOSED TO BECOMING, THE SAME OR THE IDENTICAL, STRICTLY SPEAKING, IS NOT. THE NEGATIVE AS THE LOWEST DEGREE OF POWER, THE REACTIVE AS THE LOWEST DEGREE OF FORCE, DO NOT RETURN BECAUSE THEY ARE THE OPPOSITE OF BECOMING AND ONLY BECOMING HAS BEING. WE CAN THUS SEE HOW THE ETERNAL RETURN IS LINKED, NOT TO A REPETITION OF THE SAME, BUT ON THE CONTRARY, TO A TRANSMUTATION. IT IS THE MOMENT OR THE ETERNITY OF BECOMING WHICH ELIMINATES ALL THAT RESISTS IT. IT RELEASES, INDEED IT CREATES, THE PURELY ACTIVE AND PURE AFFIRMATION. AND THIS IS THE SOLE CONTENT OF THE OVERMAN; HE IS THE JOINT PRODUCT OF THE WILL TO POWER AND THE ETERNAL RETURN, DIONYSUS AND ARIADNE. THIS IS WHY NIETZSCHE SAYS THAT THE WILL TO POWER IS NOT WANTING, COVETING OR SEEKING POWER, BUT ONLY ‚ÄÚGIVING‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚCREATING.‚ÄÙ

BUT THE DIFFICULTY OF NIETZSCHE DEPENDS LESS ON CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS THAN ON PRACTICAL EVALUATIONS WHICH EVOKE A WHOLE ATMOSPHERE, ALL KINDS OF EMOTIONAL DISPOSITIONS IN THE READER. LIKE SPINOZA, NIETZSCHE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THAT THERE IS THE DEEPEST RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONCEPT AND AFFECT. CONCEPTUAL ANALYSES ARE INDISPENSABLE AND NIETZSCHE TAKES THEM FURTHER THAN ANYONE ELSE. BUT THEY WILL ALWAYS BE INEFFECTIVE IF THE READER GRASPS THEM IN AN ATMOSPHERE WHICH IS NOT THAT OF NIETZSCHE. AS LONG AS THE READER PERSISTS IN: 1) SEEING THE NIETZSCHEAN ‚ÄÚSLAVE‚ÄÙ AS SOMEONE WHO FINDS HIMSELF DOMINATED BY A MASTER, AND DESERVES TO BE; 2) UNDERSTANDING THE WILL TO POWER AS A WILL WHICH WANTS AND SEEKS POWER; 3) CONCEIVING THE ETERNAL RETURN AS THE TEDIOUS RETURN OF THE SAME; 4) IMAGINING THE OVERMAN AS A GIVEN MASTER RACE‚ÄÎNO POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NIETZSCHE AND HIS READER WILL BE POSSIBLE. NIETZSCHE WILL APPEAR A NIHILIST, OR WORSE, A FASCIST AND AT BEST AS AN OBSCURE AND TERRIFYING PROPHET. NIETZSCHE KNEW THIS, HE KNEW THE FATE THAT LAY IN STORE FOR HIM, HE WHO GAVE ZARATHUSTRA AN ‚ÄÚAPE‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚBUFFOON‚ÄÙ AS A DOUBLE, FORETELLING THAT ZARATHUSTRA WOULD BE CONFUSED WITH HIS APE (A PROPHET, A FASCIST OR A MADMAN‚Ä¶). THIS IS WHY A BOOK ABOUT NIETZSCHE MUST TRY HARD TO CORRECT THE PRACTICAL OR EMOTIONAL MISUNDERSTANDING AS WELL AS RE-ESTABLISHING THE CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS.

AND IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT NIETZSCHE DIAGNOSED NIHILISM AS THE MOVEMENT WHICH CARRIES HISTORY FORWARD. NO ONE HAS ANALYSED THE CONCEPT OF NIHILISM BETTER THAN HE DID, HE INVENTED THE CONCEPT. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO SEE THAT HE DEFINED IT IN TERMS OF THE TRIUMPH OF REACTIVE FORCES OR THE NEGATIVE IN THE WILL TO POWER. TO NIHILISM HE OPPOSED TRANSMUTATION, THAT IS THE BECOMING WHICH IS SIMULTANEOUSLY THE ONLY ACTION OF FORCE AND THE ONLY AFFIRMATION OF POWER, THE TRANSHISTORIC ELEMENT OF MAN, THE OVERMAN (AND NOT THE SUPERMAN). THE OVERMAN IS THE FOCAL POINT, WHERE THE REACTIVE (RESSENTIMENT AND BAD CONSCIENCE) IS CONQUERED, AND WHERE THE NEGATIVE GIVES WAY TO AFFIRMATION. NIETZSCHE REMAINS INSEPARABLE, AT EVERY MOMENT, FROM THE FORCES OF THE FUTURE, FROM THE FORCES YET TO COME THAT HIS PRAYERS INVOKE, THAT HIS THOUGHT OUTLINES, THAT HIS ART PREFIGURES. HE NOT ONLY DIAGNOSES, AS KAFKA PUT IT, THE DIABOLICAL FORCES ALREADY KNOCKING AT THE DOOR, BUT HE EXORCISES THEM BY RAISING THE LAST POWER CAPABLE OF STRUGGLING WITH THEM, AGAINST THEM, AND OF OUSTING THEM BOTH WITHIN US AND OUTSIDE US. A NIETZSCHEAN ‚ÄÚAPHORISM‚ÄÙ IS NOT A MERE FRAGMENT, A MORSEL OF THOUGHT: IT IS A PROPOSITION WHICH ONLY MAKES SENSE IN RELATION TO THE STATE OF FORCES THAT IT EXPRESSES, AND WHICH CHANGES SENSE, WHICH MUST CHANGE SENSE, ACCORDING TO THE NEW FORCES WHICH IT IS ‚ÄÚCAPABLE‚ÄÙ (HAS THE POWER) OF ATTRACTING.

AND WITHOUT DOUBT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT OF NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS PHILOSOPHY: THE RADICAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE IMAGE OF THOUGHT THAT WE CREATE FOR OURSELVES. NIETZSCHE SNATCHES THOUGHT FROM THE ELEMENT OF TRUTH AND FALSITY. HE TURNS IT INTO AN INTERPRETATION AND AN EVALUATION, INTERPRETATION OF FORCES, EVALUATION OF POWER.‚ÄÎIT IS A THOUGHT-MOVEMENT, NOT MERELY IN THE SENSE THAT NIETZSCHE WANTS TO RECONCILE THOUGHT AND CONCRETE MOVEMENT, BUT IN THE SENSE THAT THOUGHT ITSELF MUST PRODUCE MOVEMENTS, BURSTS OF EXTRAORDINARY SPEED AND SLOWNESS (HERE AGAIN WE CAN SEE THE ROLE OF THE APHORISM, WITH ITS VARIABLE SPEEDS AND ITS ‚ÄÚPROJECTILE-LIKE‚ÄÙ MOVEMENT). AS A RESULT PHILOSOPHY HAS A NEW RELATIONSHIP TO THE ARTS OF MOVEMENT: THEATRE, DANCE AND MUSIC. NIETZSCHE WAS NEVER SATISFIED WITH THE DISCOURSE OR THE DISSERTATION (LOGOS) AS AN EXPRESSION OF PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT, ALTHOUGH HE WROTE THE FINEST DISSERTATIONS‚ÄÎNOTABLY THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS, TO WHICH ALL MODERN ETHNOLOGY OWES AN INEXHAUSTIBLE ‚ÄÚDEBT.‚ÄÙ BUT A BOOK LIKE ZARATHUSTRA CAN ONLY BE READ AS A MODERN OPERA AND SEEN AND HEARD AS SUCH. IT IS NOT THAT NIETZSCHE PRODUCES A PHILOSOPHICAL OPERA OR A PIECE OF ALLEGORICAL THEATRE, BUT HE CREATES A PIECE OF THEATRE OR AN OPERA WHICH DIRECTLY EXPRESSES THOUGHT AS EXPERIENCE AND MOVEMENT. AND WHEN NIETZSCHE SAYS THAT THE OVERMAN RESEMBLES A BORGIA RATHER THAN A PARSIFAL, OR THAT HE IS A MEMBER OF BOTH THE ORDER OF JESUITS AND THE PRUSSIAN OFFICER CORPS, IT WOULD BE WRONG TO SEE THESE AS PROTOFASCIST STATEMENTS, SINCE THEY ARE THE REMARKS OF A DIRECTOR INDICATING HOW THE OVERMAN SHOULD BE ‚ÄÚPLAYED‚ÄÙ (RATHER LIKE KIERKEGAARD SAYING THAT THE KNIGHT OF THE FAITH IS LIKE A BOURGEOIS IN HIS SUNDAY BEST).‚ÄÎTO THINK IS TO CREATE: THIS IS NIETZSCHE‚ÄÔS GREATEST LESSON. TO THINK, TO CAST THE DICE ‚Ä¶: THIS WAS ALREADY THE SENSE OF THE ETERNAL RETURN.

PART I





CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTORY

SOME DETAILS OF THE BIOGRAPHY OF THAT HIGHLY RESPECTED GENTLEMAN STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH VERHOVENSKY.

I

IN UNDERTAKING TO DESCRIBE THE RECENT AND STRANGE INCIDENTS IN OUR TOWN, TILL LATELY WRAPPED IN UNEVENTFUL OBSCURITY, I FIND MYSELF FORCED IN ABSENCE OF LITERARY SKILL TO BEGIN MY STORY RATHER FAR BACK, THAT IS TO SAY, WITH CERTAIN BIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS CONCERNING THAT TALENTED AND HIGHLY-ESTEEMED GENTLEMAN, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH VERHOVENSKY. I TRUST THAT THESE DETAILS MAY AT LEAST SERVE AS AN INTRODUCTION, WHILE MY PROJECTED STORY ITSELF WILL COME LATER.

I WILL SAY AT ONCE THAT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HAD ALWAYS FILLED A PARTICULAR R√¥LE AMONG US, THAT OF THE PROGRESSIVE PATRIOT, SO TO SAY, AND HE WAS PASSIONATELY FOND OF PLAYING THE PART‚ÄÎSO MUCH SO THAT I REALLY BELIEVE HE COULD NOT HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT IT. NOT THAT I WOULD PUT HIM ON A LEVEL WITH AN ACTOR AT A THEATRE, GOD FORBID, FOR I REALLY HAVE A RESPECT FOR HIM. THIS MAY ALL HAVE BEEN THE EFFECT OF HABIT, OR RATHER, MORE EXACTLY OF A GENEROUS PROPENSITY HE HAD FROM HIS EARLIEST YEARS FOR INDULGING IN AN AGREEABLE DAY-DREAM IN WHICH HE FIGURED AS A PICTURESQUE PUBLIC CHARACTER. HE FONDLY LOVED, FOR INSTANCE, HIS POSITION AS A ‚ÄÚPERSECUTED‚ÄÙ MAN AND, SO TO SPEAK, AN ‚ÄÚEXILE.‚ÄÙ THERE IS A SORT OF TRADITIONAL GLAMOUR ABOUT THOSE TWO LITTLE WORDS THAT FASCINATED HIM ONCE FOR ALL AND, EXALTING HIM GRADUALLY IN HIS OWN OPINION, RAISED HIM IN THE COURSE OF YEARS TO A LOFTY PEDESTAL VERY GRATIFYING TO VANITY. IN AN ENGLISH SATIRE OF THE LAST CENTURY, GULLIVER, RETURNING FROM THE LAND OF THE LILLIPUTIANS WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE ONLY THREE OR FOUR INCHES HIGH, HAD GROWN SO ACCUSTOMED TO CONSIDER HIMSELF A GIANT AMONG THEM, THAT AS HE WALKED ALONG THE STREETS OF LONDON HE COULD NOT HELP CRYING OUT TO CARRIAGES AND PASSERS-BY TO BE CAREFUL AND GET OUT OF HIS WAY FOR FEAR HE SHOULD CRUSH THEM, IMAGINING THAT THEY WERE LITTLE AND HE WAS STILL A GIANT. HE WAS LAUGHED AT AND ABUSED FOR IT, AND ROUGH COACHMEN EVEN LASHED AT THE GIANT WITH THEIR WHIPS. BUT WAS THAT JUST? WHAT MAY NOT BE DONE BY HABIT? HABIT HAD BROUGHT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH ALMOST TO THE SAME POSITION, BUT IN A MORE INNOCENT AND INOFFENSIVE FORM, IF ONE MAY USE SUCH EXPRESSIONS, FOR HE WAS A MOST EXCELLENT MAN.

I AM EVEN INCLINED TO SUPPOSE THAT TOWARDS THE END HE HAD BEEN ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN EVERYWHERE; BUT STILL IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT HIS NAME HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN. IT IS BEYOND QUESTION THAT HE HAD AT ONE TIME BELONGED TO A CERTAIN DISTINGUISHED CONSTELLATION OF CELEBRATED LEADERS OF THE LAST GENERATION, AND AT ONE TIME‚ÄÎTHOUGH ONLY FOR THE BRIEFEST MOMENT‚ÄÎHIS NAME WAS PRONOUNCED BY MANY HASTY PERSONS OF THAT DAY ALMOST AS THOUGH IT WERE ON A LEVEL WITH THE NAMES OF TCHAADAEV, OF BYELINSKY, OF GRANOVSKY, AND OF HERZEN, WHO HAD ONLY JUST BEGUN TO WRITE ABROAD. BUT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS ACTIVITY CEASED ALMOST AT THE MOMENT IT BEGAN, OWING, SO TO SAY, TO A ‚ÄÚVORTEX OF COMBINED CIRCUMSTANCES.‚ÄÙ AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT? IT TURNED OUT AFTERWARDS THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO ‚ÄÚVORTEX‚ÄÙ AND EVEN NO ‚ÄÚCIRCUMSTANCES,‚ÄÙ AT LEAST IN THAT CONNECTION. I ONLY LEARNED THE OTHER DAY TO MY INTENSE AMAZEMENT, THOUGH ON THE MOST UNIMPEACHABLE AUTHORITY, THAT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HAD LIVED AMONG US IN OUR PROVINCE NOT AS AN ‚ÄÚEXILE‚ÄÙ AS WE WERE ACCUSTOMED TO BELIEVE, AND HAD NEVER EVEN BEEN UNDER POLICE SUPERVISION AT ALL. SUCH IS THE FORCE OF IMAGINATION! ALL HIS LIFE HE SINCERELY BELIEVED THAT IN CERTAIN SPHERES HE WAS A CONSTANT CAUSE OF APPREHENSION, THAT EVERY STEP HE TOOK WAS WATCHED AND NOTED, AND THAT EACH ONE OF THE THREE GOVERNORS WHO SUCCEEDED ONE ANOTHER DURING TWENTY YEARS IN OUR PROVINCE CAME WITH SPECIAL AND UNEASY IDEAS CONCERNING HIM, WHICH HAD, BY HIGHER POWERS, BEEN IMPRESSED UPON EACH BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE, ON RECEIVING THE APPOINTMENT. HAD ANYONE ASSURED THE HONEST MAN ON THE MOST IRREFUTABLE GROUNDS THAT HE HAD NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF, HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN OFFENDED. YET STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS A MOST INTELLIGENT AND GIFTED MAN, EVEN, SO TO SAY, A MAN OF SCIENCE, THOUGH INDEED, IN SCIENCE ‚Ä¶ WELL, IN FACT HE HAD NOT DONE SUCH GREAT THINGS IN SCIENCE. I BELIEVE INDEED HE HAD DONE NOTHING AT ALL. BUT THAT‚ÄÔS VERY OFTEN THE CASE, OF COURSE, WITH MEN OF SCIENCE AMONG US IN RUSSIA.

HE CAME BACK FROM ABROAD AND WAS BRILLIANT IN THE CAPACITY OF LECTURER AT THE UNIVERSITY, TOWARDS THE END OF THE FORTIES. HE ONLY HAD TIME TO DELIVER A FEW LECTURES, I BELIEVE THEY WERE ABOUT THE ARABS; HE MAINTAINED, TOO, A BRILLIANT THESIS ON THE POLITICAL AND HANSEATIC IMPORTANCE OF THE GERMAN TOWN HANAU, OF WHICH THERE WAS PROMISE IN THE EPOCH BETWEEN 1413 AND 1428, AND ON THE SPECIAL AND OBSCURE REASONS WHY THAT PROMISE WAS NEVER FULFILLED. THIS DISSERTATION WAS A CRUEL AND SKILFUL THRUST AT THE SLAVOPHILS OF THE DAY, AND AT ONCE MADE HIM NUMEROUS AND IRRECONCILABLE ENEMIES AMONG THEM. LATER ON‚ÄÎAFTER HE HAD LOST HIS POST AS LECTURER, HOWEVER‚ÄÎHE PUBLISHED (BY WAY OF REVENGE, SO TO SAY, AND TO SHOW THEM WHAT A MAN THEY HAD LOST) IN A PROGRESSIVE MONTHLY REVIEW, WHICH TRANSLATED DICKENS AND ADVOCATED THE VIEWS OF GEORGE SAND, THE BEGINNING OF A VERY PROFOUND INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES, I BELIEVE, OF THE EXTRAORDINARY MORAL NOBILITY OF CERTAIN KNIGHTS AT A CERTAIN EPOCH OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE.

SOME LOFTY AND EXCEPTIONALLY NOBLE IDEA WAS MAINTAINED IN IT, ANYWAY. IT WAS SAID AFTERWARDS THAT THE CONTINUATION WAS HURRIEDLY FORBIDDEN AND EVEN THAT THE PROGRESSIVE REVIEW HAD TO SUFFER FOR HAVING PRINTED THE FIRST PART. THAT MAY VERY WELL HAVE BEEN SO, FOR WHAT WAS NOT POSSIBLE IN THOSE DAYS? THOUGH, IN THIS CASE, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT THERE WAS NOTHING OF THE KIND, AND THAT THE AUTHOR HIMSELF WAS TOO LAZY TO CONCLUDE HIS ESSAY. HE CUT SHORT HIS LECTURES ON THE ARABS BECAUSE, SOMEHOW AND BY SOMEONE (PROBABLY ONE OF HIS REACTIONARY ENEMIES) A LETTER HAD BEEN SEIZED GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH SOMEONE HAD DEMANDED AN EXPLANATION FROM HIM. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHETHER THE STORY IS TRUE, BUT IT WAS ASSERTED THAT AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS DISCOVERED IN PETERSBURG A VAST, UNNATURAL, AND ILLEGAL CONSPIRACY OF THIRTY PEOPLE WHICH ALMOST SHOOK SOCIETY TO ITS FOUNDATIONS. IT WAS SAID THAT THEY WERE POSITIVELY ON THE POINT OF TRANSLATING FOURIER. AS THOUGH OF DESIGN A POEM OF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS WAS SEIZED IN MOSCOW AT THAT VERY TIME, THOUGH IT HAD BEEN WRITTEN SIX YEARS BEFORE IN BERLIN IN HIS EARLIEST YOUTH, AND MANUSCRIPT COPIES HAD BEEN PASSED ROUND A CIRCLE CONSISTING OF TWO POETICAL AMATEURS AND ONE STUDENT. THIS POEM IS LYING NOW ON MY TABLE. NO LONGER AGO THAN LAST YEAR I RECEIVED A RECENT COPY IN HIS OWN HANDWRITING FROM STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HIMSELF, SIGNED BY HIM, AND BOUND IN A SPLENDID RED LEATHER BINDING. IT IS NOT WITHOUT POETIC MERIT, HOWEVER, AND EVEN A CERTAIN TALENT. IT‚ÄÔS STRANGE, BUT IN THOSE DAYS (OR TO BE MORE EXACT, IN THE THIRTIES) PEOPLE WERE CONSTANTLY COMPOSING IN THAT STYLE. I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE THE SUBJECT, FOR I REALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT. IT IS SOME SORT OF AN ALLEGORY IN LYRICAL-DRAMATIC FORM, RECALLING THE SECOND PART OF FAUST. THE SCENE OPENS WITH A CHORUS OF WOMEN, FOLLOWED BY A CHORUS OF MEN, THEN A CHORUS OF INCORPOREAL POWERS OF SOME SORT, AND AT THE END OF ALL A CHORUS OF SPIRITS NOT YET LIVING BUT VERY EAGER TO COME TO LIFE. ALL THESE CHORUSES SING ABOUT SOMETHING VERY INDEFINITE, FOR THE MOST PART ABOUT SOMEBODY‚ÄÔS CURSE, BUT WITH A TINGE OF THE HIGHER HUMOUR. BUT THE SCENE IS SUDDENLY CHANGED. THERE BEGINS A SORT OF ‚ÄÚFESTIVAL OF LIFE‚ÄÙ AT WHICH EVEN INSECTS SING, A TORTOISE COMES ON THE SCENE WITH CERTAIN SACRAMENTAL LATIN WORDS, AND EVEN, IF I REMEMBER ARIGHT, A MINERAL SINGS ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS A QUITE INANIMATE OBJECT. IN FACT, THEY ALL SING CONTINUALLY, OR IF THEY CONVERSE, IT IS SIMPLY TO ABUSE ONE ANOTHER VAGUELY, BUT AGAIN WITH A TINGE OF HIGHER MEANING. AT LAST THE SCENE IS CHANGED AGAIN; A WILDERNESS APPEARS, AND AMONG THE ROCKS THERE WANDERS A CIVILIZED YOUNG MAN WHO PICKS AND SUCKS CERTAIN HERBS. ASKED BY A FAIRY WHY HE SUCKS THESE HERBS, HE ANSWERS THAT, CONSCIOUS OF A SUPERFLUITY OF LIFE IN HIMSELF, HE SEEKS FORGETFULNESS, AND FINDS IT IN THE JUICE OF THESE HERBS, BUT THAT HIS GREAT DESIRE IS TO LOSE HIS REASON AT ONCE (A DESIRE POSSIBLY SUPERFLUOUS). THEN A YOUTH OF INDESCRIBABLE BEAUTY RIDES IN ON A BLACK STEED, AND AN IMMENSE MULTITUDE OF ALL NATIONS FOLLOW HIM. THE YOUTH REPRESENTS DEATH, FOR WHOM ALL THE PEOPLES ARE YEARNING. AND FINALLY, IN THE LAST SCENE WE ARE SUDDENLY SHOWN THE TOWER OF BABEL, AND CERTAIN ATHLETES AT LAST FINISH BUILDING IT WITH A SONG OF NEW HOPE, AND WHEN AT LENGTH THEY COMPLETE THE TOPMOST PINNACLE, THE LORD (OF OLYMPIA, LET US SAY) TAKES FLIGHT IN A COMIC FASHION, AND MAN, GRASPING THE SITUATION AND SEIZING HIS PLACE, AT ONCE BEGINS A NEW LIFE WITH NEW INSIGHT INTO THINGS. WELL, THIS POEM WAS THOUGHT AT THAT TIME TO BE DANGEROUS. LAST YEAR I PROPOSED TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH TO PUBLISH IT, ON THE GROUND OF ITS PERFECT HARMLESSNESS NOWADAYS, BUT HE DECLINED THE SUGGESTION WITH EVIDENT DISSATISFACTION. MY VIEW OF ITS COMPLETE HARMLESSNESS EVIDENTLY DISPLEASED HIM, AND I EVEN ASCRIBE TO IT A CERTAIN COLDNESS ON HIS PART, WHICH LASTED TWO WHOLE MONTHS.

AND WHAT DO YOU THINK? SUDDENLY, ALMOST AT THE TIME I PROPOSED PRINTING IT HERE, OUR POEM WAS PUBLISHED ABROAD IN A COLLECTION OF REVOLUTIONARY VERSE, WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. HE WAS AT FIRST ALARMED, RUSHED TO THE GOVERNOR, AND WROTE A NOBLE LETTER IN SELF-DEFENCE TO PETERSBURG. HE READ IT TO ME TWICE, BUT DID NOT SEND IT, NOT KNOWING TO WHOM TO ADDRESS IT. IN FACT HE WAS IN A STATE OF AGITATION FOR A WHOLE MONTH, BUT I AM CONVINCED THAT IN THE SECRET RECESSES OF HIS HEART HE WAS ENORMOUSLY FLATTERED. HE ALMOST TOOK THE COPY OF THE COLLECTION TO BED WITH HIM, AND KEPT IT HIDDEN UNDER HIS MATTRESS IN THE DAYTIME; HE POSITIVELY WOULD NOT ALLOW THE WOMEN TO TURN HIS BED, AND ALTHOUGH HE EXPECTED EVERY DAY A TELEGRAM, HE HELD HIS HEAD HIGH. NO TELEGRAM CAME. THEN HE MADE FRIENDS WITH ME AGAIN, WHICH IS A PROOF OF THE EXTREME KINDNESS OF HIS GENTLE AND UNRESENTFUL HEART.

II

OF COURSE I DON‚ÄÔT ASSERT THAT HE HAD NEVER SUFFERED FOR HIS CONVICTIONS AT ALL, BUT I AM FULLY CONVINCED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE GONE ON LECTURING ON HIS ARABS AS LONG AS HE LIKED, IF HE HAD ONLY GIVEN THE NECESSARY EXPLANATIONS. BUT HE WAS TOO LOFTY, AND HE PROCEEDED WITH PECULIAR HASTE TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HIS CAREER WAS RUINED FOREVER ‚ÄÚBY THE VORTEX OF CIRCUMSTANCE.‚ÄÙ AND IF THE WHOLE TRUTH IS TO BE TOLD THE REAL CAUSE OF THE CHANGE IN HIS CAREER WAS THE VERY DELICATE PROPOSITION WHICH HAD BEEN MADE BEFORE AND WAS THEN RENEWED BY VARVARA PETROVNA STAVROGIN, A LADY OF GREAT WEALTH, THE WIFE OF A LIEUTENANT-GENERAL, THAT HE SHOULD UNDERTAKE THE EDUCATION AND THE WHOLE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT OF HER ONLY SON IN THE CAPACITY OF A SUPERIOR SORT OF TEACHER AND FRIEND, TO SAY NOTHING OF A MAGNIFICENT SALARY. THIS PROPOSAL HAD BEEN MADE TO HIM THE FIRST TIME IN BERLIN, AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE WAS FIRST LEFT A WIDOWER. HIS FIRST WIFE WAS A FRIVOLOUS GIRL FROM OUR PROVINCE, WHOM HE MARRIED IN HIS EARLY AND UNTHINKING YOUTH, AND APPARENTLY HE HAD HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE WITH THIS YOUNG PERSON, CHARMING AS SHE WAS, OWING TO THE LACK OF MEANS FOR HER SUPPORT; AND ALSO FROM OTHER, MORE DELICATE, REASONS. SHE DIED IN PARIS AFTER THREE YEARS‚ÄÔ SEPARATION FROM HIM, LEAVING HIM A SON OF FIVE YEARS OLD; ‚ÄÚTHE FRUIT OF OUR FIRST, JOYOUS, AND UNCLOUDED LOVE,‚ÄÙ WERE THE WORDS THE SORROWING FATHER ONCE LET FALL IN MY PRESENCE.

THE CHILD HAD, FROM THE FIRST, BEEN SENT BACK TO RUSSIA, WHERE HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE CHARGE OF DISTANT COUSINS IN SOME REMOTE REGION. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HAD DECLINED VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS PROPOSAL ON THAT OCCASION AND HAD QUICKLY MARRIED AGAIN, BEFORE THE YEAR WAS OVER, A TACITURN BERLIN GIRL, AND, WHAT MAKES IT MORE STRANGE, THERE WAS NO PARTICULAR NECESSITY FOR HIM TO DO SO. BUT APART FROM HIS MARRIAGE THERE WERE, IT APPEARS, OTHER REASONS FOR HIS DECLINING THE SITUATION. HE WAS TEMPTED BY THE RESOUNDING FAME OF A PROFESSOR, CELEBRATED AT THAT TIME, AND HE, IN HIS TURN, HASTENED TO THE LECTURER‚ÄÔS CHAIR FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN PREPARING HIMSELF, TO TRY HIS EAGLE WINGS IN FLIGHT. BUT NOW WITH SINGED WINGS HE NATURALLY REMEMBERED THE PROPOSITION WHICH EVEN THEN HAD MADE HIM HESITATE. THE SUDDEN DEATH OF HIS SECOND WIFE, WHO DID NOT LIVE A YEAR WITH HIM, SETTLED THE MATTER DECISIVELY. TO PUT IT PLAINLY IT WAS ALL BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE PASSIONATE SYMPATHY AND PRICELESS, SO TO SPEAK, CLASSIC FRIENDSHIP OF VARVARA PETROVNA, IF ONE MAY USE SUCH AN EXPRESSION OF FRIENDSHIP. HE FLUNG HIMSELF INTO THE ARMS OF THIS FRIENDSHIP, AND HIS POSITION WAS SETTLED FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS. I USE THE EXPRESSION ‚ÄÚFLUNG HIMSELF INTO THE ARMS OF,‚ÄÙ BUT GOD FORBID THAT ANYONE SHOULD FLY TO IDLE AND SUPERFLUOUS CONCLUSIONS. THESE EMBRACES MUST BE UNDERSTOOD ONLY IN THE MOST LOFTILY MORAL SENSE. THE MOST REFINED AND DELICATE TIE UNITED THESE TWO BEINGS, BOTH SO REMARKABLE, FOREVER.

THE POST OF TUTOR WAS THE MORE READILY ACCEPTED TOO, AS THE PROPERTY‚ÄÎA VERY SMALL ONE‚ÄÎLEFT TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH BY HIS FIRST WIFE WAS CLOSE TO SKVORESHNIKI, THE STAVROGINS‚ÄÔ MAGNIFICENT ESTATE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF OUR PROVINCIAL TOWN. BESIDES, IN THE STILLNESS OF HIS STUDY, FAR FROM THE IMMENSE BURDEN OF UNIVERSITY WORK, IT WAS ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO THE SERVICE OF SCIENCE, AND TO ENRICH THE LITERATURE OF HIS COUNTRY WITH ERUDITE STUDIES. THESE WORKS DID NOT APPEAR. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT DID APPEAR POSSIBLE TO SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE, MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS, ‚ÄÚA REPROACH INCARNATE,‚ÄÙ SO TO SPEAK, TO HIS NATIVE COUNTRY, IN THE WORDS OF A POPULAR POET:

REPROACH INCARNATE THOU DIDST STAND ERECT BEFORE THY FATHERLAND, O LIBERAL IDEALIST!

BUT THE PERSON TO WHOM THE POPULAR POET REFERRED MAY PERHAPS HAVE HAD THE RIGHT TO ADOPT THAT POSE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE IF HE HAD WISHED TO DO SO, THOUGH IT MUST HAVE BEEN TEDIOUS. OUR STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS, TO TELL THE TRUTH, ONLY AN IMITATOR COMPARED WITH SUCH PEOPLE; MOREOVER, HE HAD GROWN WEARY OF STANDING ERECT AND OFTEN LAY DOWN FOR A WHILE. BUT, TO DO HIM JUSTICE, THE ‚ÄÚINCARNATION OF REPROACH‚ÄÙ WAS PRESERVED EVEN IN THE RECUMBENT ATTITUDE, THE MORE SO AS THAT WAS QUITE SUFFICIENT FOR THE PROVINCE. YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIM AT OUR CLUB WHEN HE SAT DOWN TO CARDS. HIS WHOLE FIGURE SEEMED TO EXCLAIM ‚ÄÚCARDS! ME SIT DOWN TO WHIST WITH YOU! IS IT CONSISTENT? WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT? WHO HAS SHATTERED MY ENERGIES AND TURNED THEM TO WHIST? AH, PERISH, RUSSIA!‚ÄÙ AND HE WOULD MAJESTICALLY TRUMP WITH A HEART.

AND TO TELL THE TRUTH HE DEARLY LOVED A GAME OF CARDS, WHICH LED HIM, ESPECIALLY IN LATER YEARS, INTO FREQUENT AND UNPLEASANT SKIRMISHES WITH VARVARA PETROVNA, PARTICULARLY AS HE WAS ALWAYS LOSING. BUT OF THAT LATER. I WILL ONLY OBSERVE THAT HE WAS A MAN OF TENDER CONSCIENCE (THAT IS, SOMETIMES) AND SO WAS OFTEN DEPRESSED. IN THE COURSE OF HIS TWENTY YEARS‚ÄÔ FRIENDSHIP WITH VARVARA PETROVNA HE USED REGULARLY, THREE OR FOUR TIMES A YEAR, TO SINK INTO A STATE OF ‚ÄÚPATRIOTIC GRIEF,‚ÄÙ AS IT WAS CALLED AMONG US, OR RATHER REALLY INTO AN ATTACK OF SPLEEN, BUT OUR ESTIMABLE VARVARA PETROVNA PREFERRED THE FORMER PHRASE. OF LATE YEARS HIS GRIEF HAD BEGUN TO BE NOT ONLY PATRIOTIC, BUT AT TIMES ALCOHOLIC TOO; BUT VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS ALERTNESS SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING HIM ALL HIS LIFE FROM TRIVIAL INCLINATIONS. AND HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO LOOK AFTER HIM INDEED, FOR HE SOMETIMES BEHAVED VERY ODDLY: IN THE MIDST OF HIS EXALTED SORROW HE WOULD BEGIN LAUGHING LIKE ANY SIMPLE PEASANT. THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN HE BEGAN TO TAKE A HUMOROUS TONE EVEN ABOUT HIMSELF. BUT THERE WAS NOTHING VARVARA PETROVNA DREADED SO MUCH AS A HUMOROUS TONE. SHE WAS A WOMAN OF THE CLASSIC TYPE, A FEMALE M√¶CENAS, INVARIABLY GUIDED ONLY BY THE HIGHEST CONSIDERATIONS. THE INFLUENCE OF THIS EXALTED LADY OVER HER POOR FRIEND FOR TWENTY YEARS IS A FACT OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE. I SHALL NEED TO SPEAK OF HER MORE PARTICULARLY, WHICH I NOW PROCEED TO DO.

III

THERE ARE STRANGE FRIENDSHIPS. THE TWO FRIENDS ARE ALWAYS READY TO FLY AT ONE ANOTHER, AND GO ON LIKE THAT ALL THEIR LIVES, AND YET THEY CANNOT SEPARATE. PARTING, IN FACT, IS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE. THE ONE WHO HAS BEGUN THE QUARREL AND SEPARATED WILL BE THE FIRST TO FALL ILL AND EVEN DIE, PERHAPS, IF THE SEPARATION COMES OFF. I KNOW FOR A POSITIVE FACT THAT SEVERAL TIMES STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HAS JUMPED UP FROM THE SOFA AND BEATEN THE WALL WITH HIS FISTS AFTER THE MOST INTIMATE AND EMOTIONAL T√™TE-√†-T√™TE WITH VARVARA PETROVNA.

THIS PROCEEDING WAS BY NO MEANS AN EMPTY SYMBOL; INDEED, ON ONE OCCASION, HE BROKE SOME PLASTER OFF THE WALL. IT MAY BE ASKED HOW I COME TO KNOW SUCH DELICATE DETAILS. WHAT IF I WERE MYSELF A WITNESS OF IT? WHAT IF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HIMSELF HAS, ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION, SOBBED ON MY SHOULDER WHILE HE DESCRIBED TO ME IN LURID COLOURS ALL HIS MOST SECRET FEELINGS. (AND WHAT WAS THERE HE DID NOT SAY AT SUCH TIMES!) BUT WHAT ALMOST ALWAYS HAPPENED AFTER THESE TEARFUL OUTBREAKS WAS THAT NEXT DAY HE WAS READY TO CRUCIFY HIMSELF FOR HIS INGRATITUDE. HE WOULD SEND FOR ME IN A HURRY OR RUN OVER TO SEE ME SIMPLY TO ASSURE ME THAT VARVARA PETROVNA WAS ‚ÄÚAN ANGEL OF HONOUR AND DELICACY, WHILE HE WAS VERY MUCH THE OPPOSITE.‚ÄÙ HE DID NOT ONLY RUN TO CONFIDE IN ME, BUT, ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION, DESCRIBED IT ALL TO HER IN THE MOST ELOQUENT LETTER, AND WROTE A FULL SIGNED CONFESSION THAT NO LONGER AGO THAN THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD TOLD AN OUTSIDER THAT SHE KEPT HIM OUT OF VANITY, THAT SHE WAS ENVIOUS OF HIS TALENTS AND ERUDITION, THAT SHE HATED HIM AND WAS ONLY AFRAID TO EXPRESS HER HATRED OPENLY, DREADING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE HER AND SO DAMAGE HER LITERARY REPUTATION, THAT THIS DROVE HIM TO SELF-CONTEMPT, AND HE WAS RESOLVED TO DIE A VIOLENT DEATH, AND THAT HE WAS WAITING FOR THE FINAL WORD FROM HER WHICH WOULD DECIDE EVERYTHING, AND SO ON AND SO ON IN THE SAME STYLE. YOU CAN FANCY AFTER THIS WHAT AN HYSTERICAL PITCH THE NERVOUS OUTBREAKS OF THIS MOST INNOCENT OF ALL FIFTY-YEAR-OLD INFANTS SOMETIMES REACHED! I ONCE READ ONE OF THESE LETTERS AFTER SOME QUARREL BETWEEN THEM, ARISING FROM A TRIVIAL MATTER, BUT GROWING VENOMOUS AS IT WENT ON. I WAS HORRIFIED AND BESOUGHT HIM NOT TO SEND IT.

‚ÄÚI MUST ‚Ä¶ MORE HONOURABLE ‚Ä¶ DUTY ‚Ä¶ I SHALL DIE IF I DON‚ÄÔT CONFESS EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING!‚ÄÙ HE ANSWERED ALMOST IN DELIRIUM, AND HE DID SEND THE LETTER.

THAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM, THAT VARVARA PETROVNA NEVER WOULD HAVE SENT SUCH A LETTER. IT IS TRUE THAT HE WAS PASSIONATELY FOND OF WRITING, HE WROTE TO HER THOUGH HE LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE, AND DURING HYSTERICAL INTERLUDES HE WOULD WRITE TWO LETTERS A DAY. I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT SHE ALWAYS READ THESE LETTERS WITH THE GREATEST ATTENTION, EVEN WHEN SHE RECEIVED TWO A DAY, AND AFTER READING THEM SHE PUT THEM AWAY IN A SPECIAL DRAWER, SORTED AND ANNOTATED; MOREOVER, SHE PONDERED THEM IN HER HEART. BUT SHE KEPT HER FRIEND ALL DAY WITHOUT AN ANSWER, MET HIM AS THOUGH THERE WERE NOTHING THE MATTER, EXACTLY AS THOUGH NOTHING SPECIAL HAD HAPPENED THE DAY BEFORE. BY DEGREES SHE BROKE HIM IN SO COMPLETELY THAT AT LAST HE DID NOT HIMSELF DARE TO ALLUDE TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED THE DAY BEFORE, AND ONLY GLANCED INTO HER EYES AT TIMES. BUT SHE NEVER FORGOT ANYTHING, WHILE HE SOMETIMES FORGOT TOO QUICKLY, AND ENCOURAGED BY HER COMPOSURE HE WOULD NOT INFREQUENTLY, IF FRIENDS CAME IN, LAUGH AND MAKE JOKES OVER THE CHAMPAGNE THE VERY SAME DAY. WITH WHAT MALIGNANCY SHE MUST HAVE LOOKED AT HIM AT SUCH MOMENTS, WHILE HE NOTICED NOTHING! PERHAPS IN A WEEK‚ÄÔS TIME, A MONTH‚ÄÔS TIME, OR EVEN SIX MONTHS LATER, CHANCING TO RECALL SOME PHRASE IN SUCH A LETTER, AND THEN THE WHOLE LETTER WITH ALL ITS ATTENDANT CIRCUMSTANCES, HE WOULD SUDDENLY GROW HOT WITH SHAME, AND BE SO UPSET THAT HE FELL ILL WITH ONE OF HIS ATTACKS OF ‚ÄÚSUMMER CHOLERA.‚ÄÙ THESE ATTACKS OF A SORT OF ‚ÄÚSUMMER CHOLERA‚ÄÙ WERE, IN SOME CASES, THE REGULAR CONSEQUENCE OF HIS NERVOUS AGITATIONS AND WERE AN INTERESTING PECULIARITY OF HIS PHYSICAL CONSTITUTION.

NO DOUBT VARVARA PETROVNA DID VERY OFTEN HATE HIM. BUT THERE WAS ONE THING HE HAD NOT DISCERNED UP TO THE END: THAT WAS THAT HE HAD BECOME FOR HER A SON, HER CREATION, EVEN, ONE MAY SAY, HER INVENTION; HE HAD BECOME FLESH OF HER FLESH, AND SHE KEPT AND SUPPORTED HIM NOT SIMPLY FROM ‚ÄÚENVY OF HIS TALENTS.‚ÄÙ AND HOW WOUNDED SHE MUST HAVE BEEN BY SUCH SUPPOSITIONS! AN INEXHAUSTIBLE LOVE FOR HIM LAY CONCEALED IN HER HEART IN THE MIDST OF CONTINUAL HATRED, JEALOUSY, AND CONTEMPT. SHE WOULD NOT LET A SPECK OF DUST FALL UPON HIM, CODDLED HIM UP FOR TWENTY-TWO YEARS, WOULD NOT HAVE SLEPT FOR NIGHTS TOGETHER IF THERE WERE THE FAINTEST BREATH AGAINST HIS REPUTATION AS A POET, A LEARNED MAN, AND A PUBLIC CHARACTER. SHE HAD INVENTED HIM, AND HAD BEEN THE FIRST TO BELIEVE IN HER OWN INVENTION. HE WAS, AFTER A FASHION, HER DAY-DREAM.‚Ä¶ BUT IN RETURN SHE EXACTED A GREAT DEAL FROM HIM, SOMETIMES EVEN SLAVISHNESS. IT WAS INCREDIBLE HOW LONG SHE HARBOURED RESENTMENT. I HAVE TWO ANECDOTES TO TELL ABOUT THAT.

IV

ON ONE OCCASION, JUST AT THE TIME WHEN THE FIRST RUMOURS OF THE EMANCIPATION OF THE SERFS WERE IN THE AIR, WHEN ALL RUSSIA WAS EXULTING AND MAKING READY FOR A COMPLETE REGENERATION, VARVARA PETROVNA WAS VISITED BY A BARON FROM PETERSBURG, A MAN OF THE HIGHEST CONNECTIONS, AND VERY CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW REFORM. VARVARA PETROVNA PRIZED SUCH VISITS HIGHLY, AS HER CONNECTIONS IN HIGHER CIRCLES HAD GROWN WEAKER AND WEAKER SINCE THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND, AND HAD AT LAST CEASED ALTOGETHER. THE BARON SPENT AN HOUR DRINKING TEA WITH HER. THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE PRESENT BUT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, WHOM VARVARA PETROVNA INVITED AND EXHIBITED. THE BARON HAD HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT HIM BEFORE OR AFFECTED TO HAVE DONE SO, BUT PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO HIM AT TEA. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH OF COURSE WAS INCAPABLE OF MAKING A SOCIAL BLUNDER, AND HIS MANNERS WERE MOST ELEGANT. THOUGH I BELIEVE HE WAS BY NO MEANS OF EXALTED ORIGIN, YET IT HAPPENED THAT HE HAD FROM EARLIEST CHILDHOOD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN A MOSCOW HOUSEHOLD‚ÄÎOF HIGH RANK, AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS WELL BRED. HE SPOKE FRENCH LIKE A PARISIAN. THUS THE BARON WAS TO HAVE SEEN FROM THE FIRST GLANCE THE SORT OF PEOPLE WITH WHOM VARVARA PETROVNA SURROUNDED HERSELF, EVEN IN PROVINCIAL SECLUSION. BUT THINGS DID NOT FALL OUT LIKE THIS. WHEN THE BARON POSITIVELY ASSERTED THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH OF THE RUMOURS OF THE GREAT REFORM, WHICH WERE THEN ONLY JUST BEGINNING TO BE HEARD, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH COULD NOT CONTAIN HIMSELF, AND SUDDENLY SHOUTED ‚ÄÚHURRAH!‚ÄÙ AND EVEN MADE SOME GESTICULATION INDICATIVE OF DELIGHT. HIS EJACULATION WAS NOT OVER-LOUD AND QUITE POLITE, HIS DELIGHT WAS EVEN PERHAPS PREMEDITATED, AND HIS GESTURE PURPOSELY STUDIED BEFORE THE LOOKING-GLASS HALF AN HOUR BEFORE TEA. BUT SOMETHING MUST HAVE BEEN AMISS WITH IT, FOR THE BARON PERMITTED HIMSELF A FAINT SMILE, THOUGH HE, AT ONCE, WITH EXTRAORDINARY COURTESY, PUT IN A PHRASE CONCERNING THE UNIVERSAL AND BEFITTING EMOTION OF ALL RUSSIAN HEARTS IN VIEW OF THE GREAT EVENT. SHORTLY AFTERWARDS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE AND AT PARTING DID NOT FORGET TO HOLD OUT TWO FINGERS TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. ON RETURNING TO THE DRAWING-ROOM VARVARA PETROVNA WAS AT FIRST SILENT FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES, AND SEEMED TO BE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ON THE TABLE. THEN SHE TURNED TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, AND WITH PALE FACE AND FLASHING EYES SHE HISSED IN A WHISPER:

‚ÄÚI SHALL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR THAT!‚ÄÙ

NEXT DAY SHE MET HER FRIEND AS THOUGH NOTHING HAD HAPPENED, SHE NEVER REFERRED TO THE INCIDENT, BUT THIRTEEN YEARS AFTERWARDS, AT A TRAGIC MOMENT, SHE RECALLED IT AND REPROACHED HIM WITH IT, AND SHE TURNED PALE, JUST AS SHE HAD DONE THIRTEEN YEARS BEFORE. ONLY TWICE IN THE COURSE OF HER LIFE DID SHE SAY TO HIM:

‚ÄÚI SHALL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR THAT!‚ÄÙ

THE INCIDENT WITH THE BARON WAS THE SECOND TIME, BUT THE FIRST INCIDENT WAS SO CHARACTERISTIC AND HAD SO MUCH INFLUENCE ON THE FATE OF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH THAT I VENTURE TO REFER TO THAT TOO.

IT WAS IN 1855, IN SPRING-TIME, IN MAY, JUST AFTER THE NEWS HAD REACHED SKVORESHNIKI OF THE DEATH OF LIEUTENANT-GENERAL STAVROGIN, A FRIVOLOUS OLD GENTLEMAN WHO DIED OF A STOMACH AILMENT ON THE WAY TO THE CRIMEA, WHERE HE WAS HASTENING TO JOIN THE ARMY ON ACTIVE SERVICE. VARVARA PETROVNA WAS LEFT A WIDOW AND PUT ON DEEP MOURNING. SHE COULD NOT, IT IS TRUE, DEPLORE HIS DEATH VERY DEEPLY, SINCE, FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS, SHE HAD BEEN COMPLETELY SEPARATED FROM HIM OWING TO INCOMPATIBILITY OF TEMPER, AND WAS GIVING HIM AN ALLOWANCE. (THE LIEUTENANT-GENERAL HIMSELF HAD NOTHING BUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SERFS AND HIS PAY, BESIDES HIS POSITION AND HIS CONNECTIONS. ALL THE MONEY AND SKVORESHNIKI BELONGED TO VARVARA PETROVNA, THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF A VERY RICH CONTRACTOR.) YET SHE WAS SHOCKED BY THE SUDDENNESS OF THE NEWS, AND RETIRED INTO COMPLETE SOLITUDE. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, OF COURSE, WAS ALWAYS AT HER SIDE.

MAY WAS IN ITS FULL BEAUTY. THE EVENINGS WERE EXQUISITE. THE WILD CHERRY WAS IN FLOWER. THE TWO FRIENDS WALKED EVERY EVENING IN THE GARDEN AND USED TO SIT TILL NIGHTFALL IN THE ARBOUR, AND POUR OUT THEIR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS TO ONE ANOTHER. THEY HAD POETIC MOMENTS. UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE CHANGE IN HER POSITION VARVARA PETROVNA TALKED MORE THAN USUAL. SHE, AS IT WERE, CLUNG TO THE HEART OF HER FRIEND, AND THIS CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL EVENINGS. A STRANGE IDEA SUDDENLY CAME OVER STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH: ‚ÄÚWAS NOT THE INCONSOLABLE WIDOW RECKONING UPON HIM, AND EXPECTING FROM HIM, WHEN HER MOURNING WAS OVER, THE OFFER OF HIS HAND?‚ÄÙ A CYNICAL IDEA, BUT THE VERY LOFTINESS OF A MAN‚ÄÔS NATURE SOMETIMES INCREASES A DISPOSITION TO CYNICAL IDEAS IF ONLY FROM THE MANY-SIDEDNESS OF HIS CULTURE. HE BEGAN TO LOOK MORE DEEPLY INTO IT, AND THOUGHT IT SEEMED LIKE IT. HE PONDERED: ‚ÄÚHER FORTUNE IS IMMENSE, OF COURSE, BUT ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA CERTAINLY COULD NOT BE CALLED A BEAUTY. SHE WAS A TALL, YELLOW, BONY WOMAN WITH AN EXTREMELY LONG FACE, SUGGESTIVE OF A HORSE. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HESITATED MORE AND MORE, HE WAS TORTURED BY DOUBTS, HE POSITIVELY SHED TEARS OF INDECISION ONCE OR TWICE (HE WEPT NOT INFREQUENTLY). IN THE EVENINGS, THAT IS TO SAY IN THE ARBOUR, HIS COUNTENANCE INVOLUNTARILY BEGAN TO EXPRESS SOMETHING CAPRICIOUS AND IRONICAL, SOMETHING COQUETTISH AND AT THE SAME TIME CONDESCENDING. THIS IS APT TO HAPPEN AS IT WERE BY ACCIDENT, AND THE MORE GENTLEMANLY THE MAN THE MORE NOTICEABLE IT IS. GOODNESS ONLY KNOWS WHAT ONE IS TO THINK ABOUT IT, BUT IT‚ÄÔS MOST LIKELY THAT NOTHING HAD BEGUN WORKING IN HER HEART THAT COULD HAVE FULLY JUSTIFIED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS SUSPICIONS. MOREOVER, SHE WOULD NOT HAVE CHANGED HER NAME, STAVROGIN, FOR HIS NAME, FAMOUS AS IT WAS. PERHAPS THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT BUT THE PLAY OF FEMININITY ON HER SIDE; THE MANIFESTATION OF AN UNCONSCIOUS FEMININE YEARNING SO NATURAL IN SOME EXTREMELY FEMININE TYPES. HOWEVER, I WON‚ÄÔT ANSWER FOR IT; THE DEPTHS OF THE FEMALE HEART HAVE NOT BEEN EXPLORED TO THIS DAY. BUT I MUST CONTINUE.

IT IS TO BE SUPPOSED THAT SHE SOON INWARDLY GUESSED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HER FRIEND‚ÄÔS STRANGE EXPRESSION; SHE WAS QUICK AND OBSERVANT, AND HE WAS SOMETIMES EXTREMELY GUILELESS. BUT THE EVENINGS WENT ON AS BEFORE, AND THEIR CONVERSATIONS WERE JUST AS POETIC AND INTERESTING. AND BEHOLD ON ONE OCCASION AT NIGHTFALL, AFTER THE MOST LIVELY AND POETICAL CONVERSATION, THEY PARTED AFFECTIONATELY, WARMLY PRESSING EACH OTHER‚ÄÔS HANDS AT THE STEPS OF THE LODGE WHERE STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SLEPT. EVERY SUMMER HE USED TO MOVE INTO THIS LITTLE LODGE WHICH STOOD ADJOINING THE HUGE SEIGNORIAL HOUSE OF SKVORESHNIKI, ALMOST IN THE GARDEN. HE HAD ONLY JUST GONE IN, AND IN RESTLESS HESITATION TAKEN A CIGAR, AND NOT HAVING YET LIGHTED IT, WAS STANDING WEARY AND MOTIONLESS BEFORE THE OPEN WINDOW, GAZING AT THE LIGHT FEATHERY WHITE CLOUDS GLIDING AROUND THE BRIGHT MOON, WHEN SUDDENLY A FAINT RUSTLE MADE HIM START AND TURN ROUND. VARVARA PETROVNA, WHOM HE HAD LEFT ONLY FOUR MINUTES EARLIER, WAS STANDING BEFORE HIM AGAIN. HER YELLOW FACE WAS ALMOST BLUE. HER LIPS WERE PRESSED TIGHTLY TOGETHER AND TWITCHING AT THE CORNERS. FOR TEN FULL SECONDS SHE LOOKED HIM IN THE EYES IN SILENCE WITH A FIRM RELENTLESS GAZE, AND SUDDENLY WHISPERED RAPIDLY:

‚ÄÚI SHALL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS!‚ÄÙ

WHEN, TEN YEARS LATER, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, AFTER CLOSING THE DOORS, TOLD ME THIS MELANCHOLY TALE IN A WHISPER, HE VOWED THAT HE HAD BEEN SO PETRIFIED ON THE SPOT THAT HE HAD NOT SEEN OR HEARD HOW VARVARA PETROVNA HAD DISAPPEARED. AS SHE NEVER ONCE AFTERWARDS ALLUDED TO THE INCIDENT AND EVERYTHING WENT ON AS THOUGH NOTHING HAD HAPPENED, HE WAS ALL HIS LIFE INCLINED TO THE IDEA THAT IT WAS ALL AN HALLUCINATION, A SYMPTOM OF ILLNESS, THE MORE SO AS HE WAS ACTUALLY TAKEN ILL THAT VERY NIGHT AND WAS INDISPOSED FOR A FORTNIGHT, WHICH, BY THE WAY, CUT SHORT THE INTERVIEWS IN THE ARBOUR.

BUT IN SPITE OF HIS VAGUE THEORY OF HALLUCINATION HE SEEMED EVERY DAY, ALL HIS LIFE, TO BE EXPECTING THE CONTINUATION, AND, SO TO SAY, THE D√©NOUEMENT OF THIS AFFAIR. HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS THE END OF IT! AND IF SO HE MUST HAVE LOOKED STRANGELY SOMETIMES AT HIS FRIEND.

V

SHE HAD HERSELF DESIGNED THE COSTUME FOR HIM WHICH HE WORE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. IT WAS ELEGANT AND CHARACTERISTIC; A LONG BLACK FROCK-COAT, BUTTONED ALMOST TO THE TOP, BUT STYLISHLY CUT; A SOFT HAT (IN SUMMER A STRAW HAT) WITH A WIDE BRIM, A WHITE BATISTE CRAVAT WITH A FULL BOW AND HANGING ENDS, A CANE WITH A SILVER KNOB; HIS HAIR FLOWED ON TO HIS SHOULDERS. IT WAS DARK BROWN, AND ONLY LATELY HAD BEGUN TO GET A LITTLE GREY. HE WAS CLEAN-SHAVEN. HE WAS SAID TO HAVE BEEN VERY HANDSOME IN HIS YOUTH. AND, TO MY MIND, HE WAS STILL AN EXCEPTIONALLY IMPRESSIVE FIGURE EVEN IN OLD AGE. BESIDES, WHO CAN TALK OF OLD AGE AT FIFTY-THREE? FROM HIS SPECIAL POSE AS A PATRIOT, HOWEVER, HE DID NOT TRY TO APPEAR YOUNGER, BUT SEEMED RATHER TO PRIDE HIMSELF ON THE SOLIDITY OF HIS AGE, AND, DRESSED AS DESCRIBED, TALL AND THIN WITH FLOWING HAIR, HE LOOKED ALMOST LIKE A PATRIARCH, OR EVEN MORE LIKE THE PORTRAIT OF THE POET KUKOLNIK, ENGRAVED IN THE EDITION OF HIS WORKS PUBLISHED IN 1830 OR THEREABOUTS. THIS RESEMBLANCE WAS ESPECIALLY STRIKING WHEN HE SAT IN THE GARDEN IN SUMMERTIME, ON A SEAT UNDER A BUSH OF FLOWERING LILAC, WITH BOTH HANDS PROPPED ON HIS CANE AND AN OPEN BOOK BESIDE HIM, MUSING POETICALLY OVER THE SETTING SUN. IN REGARD TO BOOKS I MAY REMARK THAT HE CAME IN LATER YEARS RATHER TO AVOID READING. BUT THAT WAS ONLY QUITE TOWARDS THE END. THE PAPERS AND MAGAZINES ORDERED IN GREAT PROFUSION BY VARVARA PETROVNA HE WAS CONTINUALLY READING. HE NEVER LOST INTEREST IN THE SUCCESSES OF RUSSIAN LITERATURE EITHER, THOUGH HE ALWAYS MAINTAINED A DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE WITH REGARD TO THEM. HE WAS AT ONE TIME ENGROSSED IN THE STUDY OF OUR HOME AND FOREIGN POLITICS, BUT HE SOON GAVE UP THE UNDERTAKING WITH A GESTURE OF DESPAIR. IT SOMETIMES HAPPENED THAT HE WOULD TAKE DE TOCQUEVILLE WITH HIM INTO THE GARDEN WHILE HE HAD A PAUL DE KOCK IN HIS POCKET. BUT THESE ARE TRIVIAL MATTERS.

I MUST OBSERVE IN PARENTHESIS ABOUT THE PORTRAIT OF KUKOLNIK; THE ENGRAVING HAD FIRST COME INTO THE HANDS OF VARVARA PETROVNA WHEN SHE WAS A GIRL IN A HIGH-CLASS BOARDING-SCHOOL IN MOSCOW. SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE PORTRAIT AT ONCE, AFTER THE HABIT OF ALL GIRLS AT SCHOOL WHO FALL IN LOVE WITH ANYTHING THEY COME ACROSS, AS WELL AS WITH THEIR TEACHERS, ESPECIALLY THE DRAWING AND WRITING MASTERS. WHAT IS INTERESTING IN THIS, THOUGH, IS NOT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF GIRLS BUT THE FACT THAT EVEN AT FIFTY VARVARA PETROVNA KEPT THE ENGRAVING AMONG HER MOST INTIMATE AND TREASURED POSSESSIONS, SO THAT PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY ON THIS ACCOUNT THAT SHE HAD DESIGNED FOR STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH A COSTUME SOMEWHAT LIKE THE POET‚ÄÔS IN THE ENGRAVING. BUT THAT, OF COURSE, IS A TRIFLING MATTER TOO.

FOR THE FIRST YEARS OR, MORE ACCURATELY, FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE TIME HE SPENT WITH VARVARA PETROVNA, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS STILL PLANNING A BOOK AND EVERY DAY SERIOUSLY PREPARED TO WRITE IT. BUT DURING THE LATER PERIOD HE MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN EVEN WHAT HE HAD DONE. MORE AND MORE FREQUENTLY HE USED TO SAY TO US:

‚ÄÚI SEEM TO BE READY FOR WORK, MY MATERIALS ARE COLLECTED, YET THE WORK DOESN‚ÄÔT GET DONE! NOTHING IS DONE!‚ÄÙ

AND HE WOULD BOW HIS HEAD DEJECTEDLY. NO DOUBT THIS WAS CALCULATED TO INCREASE HIS PRESTIGE IN OUR EYES AS A MARTYR TO SCIENCE, BUT HE HIMSELF WAS LONGING FOR SOMETHING ELSE. ‚ÄÚTHEY HAVE FORGOTTEN ME! I‚ÄÔM NO USE TO ANYONE!‚ÄÙ BROKE FROM HIM MORE THAN ONCE. THIS INTENSIFIED DEPRESSION TOOK SPECIAL HOLD OF HIM TOWARDS THE END OF THE FIFTIES. VARVARA PETROVNA REALISED AT LAST THAT IT WAS A SERIOUS MATTER. BESIDES, SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THE IDEA THAT HER FRIEND WAS FORGOTTEN AND USELESS. TO DISTRACT HIM AND AT THE SAME TIME TO RENEW HIS FAME SHE CARRIED HIM OFF TO MOSCOW, WHERE SHE HAD FASHIONABLE ACQUAINTANCES IN THE LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC WORLD; BUT IT APPEARED THAT MOSCOW TOO WAS UNSATISFACTORY.

IT WAS A PECULIAR TIME; SOMETHING NEW WAS BEGINNING, QUITE UNLIKE THE STAGNATION OF THE PAST, SOMETHING VERY STRANGE TOO, THOUGH IT WAS FELT EVERYWHERE, EVEN AT SKVORESHNIKI. RUMOURS OF ALL SORTS REACHED US. THE FACTS WERE GENERALLY MORE OR LESS WELL KNOWN, BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT IN ADDITION TO THE FACTS THERE WERE CERTAIN IDEAS ACCOMPANYING THEM, AND WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, A GREAT NUMBER OF THEM. AND THIS WAS PERPLEXING. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE AND FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT WAS THE DRIFT OF THESE IDEAS. VARVARA PETROVNA WAS PROMPTED BY THE FEMININE COMPOSITION OF HER CHARACTER TO A COMPELLING DESIRE TO PENETRATE THE SECRET OF THEM. SHE TOOK TO READING NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES, PROHIBITED PUBLICATIONS PRINTED ABROAD AND EVEN THE REVOLUTIONARY MANIFESTOES WHICH WERE JUST BEGINNING TO APPEAR AT THE TIME (SHE WAS ABLE TO PROCURE THEM ALL); BUT THIS ONLY SET HER HEAD IN A WHIRL. SHE FELL TO WRITING LETTERS; SHE GOT FEW ANSWERS, AND THEY GREW MORE INCOMPREHENSIBLE AS TIME WENT ON. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS SOLEMNLY CALLED UPON TO EXPLAIN ‚ÄÚTHESE IDEAS‚ÄÙ TO HER ONCE FOR ALL, BUT SHE REMAINED DISTINCTLY DISSATISFIED WITH HIS EXPLANATIONS.

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS VIEW OF THE GENERAL MOVEMENT WAS SUPERCILIOUS IN THE EXTREME. IN HIS EYES ALL IT AMOUNTED TO WAS THAT HE WAS FORGOTTEN AND OF NO USE. AT LAST HIS NAME WAS MENTIONED, AT FIRST IN PERIODICALS PUBLISHED ABROAD AS THAT OF AN EXILED MARTYR, AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS IN PETERSBURG AS THAT OF A FORMER STAR IN A CELEBRATED CONSTELLATION. HE WAS EVEN FOR SOME REASON COMPARED WITH RADISHTCHEV. THEN SOMEONE PRINTED THE STATEMENT THAT HE WAS DEAD AND PROMISED AN OBITUARY NOTICE OF HIM. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH INSTANTLY PERKED UP AND ASSUMED AN AIR OF IMMENSE DIGNITY. ALL HIS DISDAIN FOR HIS CONTEMPORARIES EVAPORATED AND HE BEGAN TO CHERISH THE DREAM OF JOINING THE MOVEMENT AND SHOWING HIS POWERS. VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS FAITH IN EVERYTHING INSTANTLY REVIVED AND SHE WAS THROWN INTO A VIOLENT FERMENT. IT WAS DECIDED TO GO TO PETERSBURG WITHOUT A MOMENT‚ÄÔS DELAY, TO FIND OUT EVERYTHING ON THE SPOT, TO GO INTO EVERYTHING PERSONALLY, AND, IF POSSIBLE, TO THROW THEMSELVES HEART AND SOUL INTO THE NEW MOVEMENT. AMONG OTHER THINGS SHE ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WAS PREPARED TO FOUND A MAGAZINE OF HER OWN, AND HENCEFORWARD TO DEVOTE HER WHOLE LIFE TO IT. SEEING WHAT IT HAD COME TO, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH BECAME MORE CONDESCENDING THAN EVER, AND ON THE JOURNEY BEGAN TO BEHAVE ALMOST PATRONISINGLY TO VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÎWHICH SHE AT ONCE LAID UP IN HER HEART AGAINST HIM. SHE HAD, HOWEVER, ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT REASON FOR THE TRIP, WHICH WAS TO RENEW HER CONNECTIONS IN HIGHER SPHERES. IT WAS NECESSARY, AS FAR AS SHE COULD, TO REMIND THE WORLD OF HER EXISTENCE, OR AT ANY RATE TO MAKE AN ATTEMPT TO DO SO. THE OSTENSIBLE OBJECT OF THE JOURNEY WAS TO SEE HER ONLY SON, WHO WAS JUST FINISHING HIS STUDIES AT A PETERSBURG LYCEUM.

VI

THEY SPENT ALMOST THE WHOLE WINTER SEASON IN PETERSBURG. BUT BY LENT EVERYTHING BURST LIKE A RAINBOW-COLOURED SOAP-BUBBLE.

THEIR DREAMS WERE DISSIPATED, AND THE MUDDLE, FAR FROM BEING CLEARED UP, HAD BECOME EVEN MORE REVOLTINGLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE. TO BEGIN WITH, CONNECTIONS WITH THE HIGHER SPHERES WERE NOT ESTABLISHED, OR ONLY ON A MICROSCOPIC SCALE, AND BY HUMILIATING EXERTIONS. IN HER MORTIFICATION VARVARA PETROVNA THREW HERSELF HEART AND SOUL INTO THE ‚ÄÚNEW IDEAS,‚ÄÙ AND BEGAN GIVING EVENING RECEPTIONS. SHE INVITED LITERARY PEOPLE, AND THEY WERE BROUGHT TO HER AT ONCE IN MULTITUDES. AFTERWARDS THEY CAME OF THEMSELVES WITHOUT INVITATION, ONE BROUGHT ANOTHER. NEVER HAD SHE SEEN SUCH LITERARY MEN. THEY WERE INCREDIBLY VAIN, BUT QUITE OPEN IN THEIR VANITY, AS THOUGH THEY WERE PERFORMING A DUTY BY THE DISPLAY OF IT. SOME (BUT BY NO MEANS ALL) OF THEM EVEN TURNED UP INTOXICATED, SEEMING, HOWEVER, TO DETECT IN THIS A PECULIAR, ONLY RECENTLY DISCOVERED, MERIT. THEY WERE ALL STRANGELY PROUD OF SOMETHING. ON EVERY FACE WAS WRITTEN THAT THEY HAD ONLY JUST DISCOVERED SOME EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SECRET. THEY ABUSED ONE ANOTHER, AND TOOK CREDIT TO THEMSELVES FOR IT. IT WAS RATHER DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY HAD WRITTEN EXACTLY, BUT AMONG THEM THERE WERE CRITICS, NOVELISTS, DRAMATISTS, SATIRISTS, AND EXPOSERS OF ABUSES. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH PENETRATED INTO THEIR VERY HIGHEST CIRCLE FROM WHICH THE MOVEMENT WAS DIRECTED. INCREDIBLE HEIGHTS HAD TO BE SCALED TO REACH THIS GROUP; BUT THEY GAVE HIM A CORDIAL WELCOME, THOUGH, OF COURSE, NO ONE OF THEM HAD EVER HEARD OF HIM OR KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM EXCEPT THAT HE ‚ÄÚREPRESENTED AN IDEA.‚ÄÙ HIS MAN≈ÌUVRES AMONG THEM WERE SO SUCCESSFUL THAT HE GOT THEM TWICE TO VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS SALON IN SPITE OF THEIR OLYMPIAN GRANDEUR. THESE PEOPLE WERE VERY SERIOUS AND VERY POLITE; THEY BEHAVED NICELY; THE OTHERS WERE EVIDENTLY AFRAID OF THEM; BUT IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THEY HAD NO TIME TO SPARE. TWO OR THREE FORMER LITERARY CELEBRITIES WHO HAPPENED TO BE IN PETERSBURG, AND WITH WHOM VARVARA PETROVNA HAD LONG MAINTAINED A MOST REFINED CORRESPONDENCE, CAME ALSO. BUT TO HER SURPRISE THESE GENUINE AND QUITE INDUBITABLE CELEBRITIES WERE STILLER THAN WATER, HUMBLER THAN THE GRASS, AND SOME OF THEM SIMPLY HUNG ON TO THIS NEW RABBLE, AND WERE SHAMEFULLY CRINGING BEFORE THEM. AT FIRST STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS A SUCCESS. PEOPLE CAUGHT AT HIM AND BEGAN TO EXHIBIT HIM AT PUBLIC LITERARY GATHERINGS. THE FIRST TIME HE CAME ON TO THE PLATFORM AT SOME PUBLIC READING IN WHICH HE WAS TO TAKE PART, HE WAS RECEIVED WITH ENTHUSIASTIC CLAPPING WHICH LASTED FOR FIVE MINUTES. HE RECALLED THIS WITH TEARS NINE YEARS AFTERWARDS, THOUGH RATHER FROM HIS NATURAL ARTISTIC SENSIBILITY THAN FROM GRATITUDE. ‚ÄÚI SWEAR, AND I‚ÄÔM READY TO BET,‚ÄÙ HE DECLARED (BUT ONLY TO ME, AND IN SECRET), ‚ÄÚTHAT NOT ONE OF THAT AUDIENCE KNEW ANYTHING WHATEVER ABOUT ME.‚ÄÙ A NOTEWORTHY ADMISSION. HE MUST HAVE HAD A KEEN INTELLIGENCE SINCE HE WAS CAPABLE OF GRASPING HIS POSITION SO CLEARLY EVEN ON THE PLATFORM, EVEN IN SUCH A STATE OF EXALTATION; IT ALSO FOLLOWS THAT HE HAD NOT A KEEN INTELLIGENCE IF, NINE YEARS AFTERWARDS, HE COULD NOT RECALL IT WITHOUT MORTIFICATION. HE WAS MADE TO SIGN TWO OR THREE COLLECTIVE PROTESTS (AGAINST WHAT HE DID NOT KNOW); HE SIGNED THEM. VARVARA PETROVNA TOO WAS MADE TO PROTEST AGAINST SOME ‚ÄÚDISGRACEFUL ACTION‚ÄÙ AND SHE SIGNED TOO. THE MAJORITY OF THESE NEW PEOPLE, HOWEVER, THOUGH THEY VISITED VARVARA PETROVNA, FELT THEMSELVES FOR SOME REASON CALLED UPON TO REGARD HER WITH CONTEMPT, AND WITH UNDISGUISED IRONY. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HINTED TO ME AT BITTER MOMENTS AFTERWARDS THAT IT WAS FROM THAT TIME SHE HAD BEEN ENVIOUS OF HIM. SHE SAW, OF COURSE, THAT SHE COULD NOT GET ON WITH THESE PEOPLE, YET SHE RECEIVED THEM EAGERLY, WITH ALL THE HYSTERICAL IMPATIENCE OF HER SEX, AND, WHAT IS MORE, SHE EXPECTED SOMETHING. AT HER PARTIES SHE TALKED LITTLE, ALTHOUGH SHE COULD TALK, BUT SHE LISTENED THE MORE. THEY TALKED OF THE ABOLITION OF THE CENSORSHIP, AND OF PHONETIC SPELLING, OF THE SUBSTITUTION OF THE LATIN CHARACTERS FOR THE RUSSIAN ALPHABET, OF SOMEONE‚ÄÔS HAVING BEEN SENT INTO EXILE THE DAY BEFORE, OF SOME SCANDAL, OF THE ADVANTAGE OF SPLITTING RUSSIA INTO NATIONALITIES UNITED IN A FREE FEDERATION, OF THE ABOLITION OF THE ARMY AND THE NAVY, OF THE RESTORATION OF POLAND AS FAR AS THE DNIEPER, OF THE PEASANT REFORMS, AND OF THE MANIFESTOES, OF THE ABOLITION OF THE HEREDITARY PRINCIPLE, OF THE FAMILY, OF CHILDREN, AND OF PRIESTS, OF WOMEN‚ÄÔS RIGHTS, OF KRAEVSKY‚ÄÔS HOUSE, FOR WHICH NO ONE EVER SEEMED ABLE TO FORGIVE MR. KRAEVSKY, AND SO ON, AND SO ON. IT WAS EVIDENT THAT IN THIS MOB OF NEW PEOPLE THERE WERE MANY IMPOSTORS, BUT UNDOUBTEDLY THERE WERE ALSO MANY HONEST AND VERY ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE, IN SPITE OF SOME SURPRISING CHARACTERISTICS IN THEM. THE HONEST ONES WERE FAR MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THAN THE COARSE AND DISHONEST, BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHICH WAS BEING MADE A TOOL OF BY THE OTHER. WHEN VARVARA PETROVNA ANNOUNCED HER IDEA OF FOUNDING A MAGAZINE, PEOPLE FLOCKED TO HER IN EVEN LARGER NUMBERS, BUT CHARGES OF BEING A CAPITALIST AND AN EXPLOITER OF LABOUR WERE SHOWERED UPON HER TO HER FACE. THE RUDENESS OF THESE ACCUSATIONS WAS ONLY EQUALLED BY THEIR UNEXPECTEDNESS. THE AGED GENERAL IVAN IVANOVITCH DROZDOV, AN OLD FRIEND AND COMRADE OF THE LATE GENERAL STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS, KNOWN TO US ALL HERE AS AN EXTREMELY STUBBORN AND IRRITABLE, THOUGH VERY ESTIMABLE, MAN (IN HIS OWN WAY, OF COURSE), WHO ATE A GREAT DEAL, AND WAS DREADFULLY AFRAID OF ATHEISM, QUARRELLED AT ONE OF VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS PARTIES WITH A DISTINGUISHED YOUNG MAN. THE LATTER AT THE FIRST WORD EXCLAIMED, ‚ÄÚYOU MUST BE A GENERAL IF YOU TALK LIKE THAT,‚ÄÙ MEANING THAT HE COULD FIND NO WORD OF ABUSE WORSE THAN ‚ÄÚGENERAL.‚ÄÙ

IVAN IVANOVITCH FLEW INTO A TERRIBLE PASSION: ‚ÄÚYES, SIR, I AM A GENERAL, AND A LIEUTENANT-GENERAL, AND I HAVE SERVED MY TSAR, AND YOU, SIR, ARE A PUPPY AND AN INFIDEL!‚ÄÙ

AN OUTRAGEOUS SCENE FOLLOWED. NEXT DAY THE INCIDENT WAS EXPOSED IN PRINT, AND THEY BEGAN GETTING UP A COLLECTIVE PROTEST AGAINST VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS DISGRACEFUL CONDUCT IN NOT HAVING IMMEDIATELY TURNED THE GENERAL OUT. IN AN ILLUSTRATED PAPER THERE APPEARED A MALIGNANT CARICATURE IN WHICH VARVARA PETROVNA, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, AND GENERAL DROZDOV WERE DEPICTED AS THREE REACTIONARY FRIENDS. THERE WERE VERSES ATTACHED TO THIS CARICATURE WRITTEN BY A POPULAR POET ESPECIALLY FOR THE OCCASION. I MAY OBSERVE, FOR MY OWN PART, THAT MANY PERSONS OF GENERAL‚ÄÔS RANK CERTAINLY HAVE AN ABSURD HABIT OF SAYING, ‚ÄÚI HAVE SERVED MY TSAR‚ÄÙ ‚Ä¶ JUST AS THOUGH THEY HAD NOT THE SAME TSAR AS ALL THE REST OF US, THEIR SIMPLE FELLOW-SUBJECTS, BUT HAD A SPECIAL TSAR OF THEIR OWN.

IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE, OF COURSE, TO REMAIN ANY LONGER IN PETERSBURG, ALL THE MORE SO AS STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS OVERTAKEN BY A COMPLETE FIASCO. HE COULD NOT RESIST TALKING OF THE CLAIMS OF ART, AND THEY LAUGHED AT HIM MORE LOUDLY AS TIME WENT ON. AT HIS LAST LECTURE HE THOUGHT TO IMPRESS THEM WITH PATRIOTIC ELOQUENCE, HOPING TO TOUCH THEIR HEARTS, AND RECKONING ON THE RESPECT INSPIRED BY HIS ‚ÄÚPERSECUTION.‚ÄÙ HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO DISPUTE THE USELESSNESS AND ABSURDITY OF THE WORD ‚ÄÚFATHERLAND,‚ÄÙ ACKNOWLEDGED THE PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE OF RELIGION, BUT FIRMLY AND LOUDLY DECLARED THAT BOOTS WERE OF LESS CONSEQUENCE THAN PUSHKIN; OF MUCH LESS, INDEED. HE WAS HISSED SO MERCILESSLY THAT HE BURST INTO TEARS, THERE AND THEN, ON THE PLATFORM. VARVARA PETROVNA TOOK HIM HOME MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE. ‚ÄÚON M‚ÄÔA TRAIT√© COMME UN VIEUX BONNET DE COTON,‚ÄÙ HE BABBLED SENSELESSLY. SHE WAS LOOKING AFTER HIM ALL NIGHT, GIVING HIM LAUREL-DROPS AND REPEATING TO HIM TILL DAYBREAK, ‚ÄÚYOU WILL STILL BE OF USE; YOU WILL STILL MAKE YOUR MARK; YOU WILL BE APPRECIATED ‚Ä¶ IN ANOTHER PLACE.‚ÄÙ

EARLY NEXT MORNING FIVE LITERARY MEN CALLED ON VARVARA PETROVNA, THREE OF THEM COMPLETE STRANGERS, WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SET EYES ON BEFORE. WITH A STERN AIR THEY INFORMED HER THAT THEY HAD LOOKED INTO THE QUESTION OF HER MAGAZINE, AND HAD BROUGHT HER THEIR DECISION ON THE SUBJECT. VARVARA PETROVNA HAD NEVER AUTHORISED ANYONE TO LOOK INTO OR DECIDE ANYTHING CONCERNING HER MAGAZINE. THEIR DECISION WAS THAT, HAVING FOUNDED THE MAGAZINE, SHE SHOULD AT ONCE HAND IT OVER TO THEM WITH THE CAPITAL TO RUN IT, ON THE BASIS OF A CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY. SHE HERSELF WAS TO GO BACK TO SKVORESHNIKI, NOT FORGETTING TO TAKE WITH HER STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, WHO WAS ‚ÄÚOUT OF DATE.‚ÄÙ FROM DELICACY THEY AGREED TO RECOGNISE THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN HER CASE, AND TO SEND HER EVERY YEAR A SIXTH PART OF THE NET PROFITS. WHAT WAS MOST TOUCHING ABOUT IT WAS THAT OF THESE FIVE MEN, FOUR CERTAINLY WERE NOT ACTUATED BY ANY MERCENARY MOTIVE, AND WERE SIMPLY ACTING IN THE INTERESTS OF THE ‚ÄÚCAUSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWE CAME AWAY UTTERLY AT A LOSS,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH USED TO SAY AFTERWARDS. ‚ÄÚI COULDN‚ÄÔT MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF IT, AND KEPT MUTTERING, I REMEMBER, TO THE RUMBLE OF THE TRAIN:

     ‚ÄÒVYEK, AND VYEK, AND LYOV KAMBEK,
     LYOV KAMBEK AND VYEK, AND VYEK.‚ÄÔ
AND GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT, ALL THE WAY TO MOSCOW. IT WAS ONLY IN MOSCOW THAT I CAME TO MYSELF‚ÄÎAS THOUGH WE REALLY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING DIFFERENT THERE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, MY FRIENDS!‚ÄÙ HE WOULD EXCLAIM TO US SOMETIMES WITH FERVOUR, ‚ÄÚYOU CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT WRATH AND SADNESS OVERCOME YOUR WHOLE SOUL WHEN A GREAT IDEA, WHICH YOU HAVE LONG CHERISHED AS HOLY, IS CAUGHT UP BY THE IGNORANT AND DRAGGED FORTH BEFORE FOOLS LIKE THEMSELVES INTO THE STREET, AND YOU SUDDENLY MEET IT IN THE MARKET UNRECOGNISABLE, IN THE MUD, ABSURDLY SET UP, WITHOUT PROPORTION, WITHOUT HARMONY, THE PLAYTHING OF FOOLISH LOUTS! NO! IN OUR DAY IT WAS NOT SO, AND IT WAS NOT THIS FOR WHICH WE STROVE. NO, NO, NOT THIS AT ALL. I DON‚ÄÔT RECOGNISE IT.‚Ä¶ OUR DAY WILL COME AGAIN AND WILL TURN ALL THE TOTTERING FABRIC OF TO-DAY INTO A TRUE PATH. IF NOT, WHAT WILL HAPPEN?‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

VII

IMMEDIATELY ON THEIR RETURN FROM PETERSBURG VARVARA PETROVNA SENT HER FRIEND ABROAD TO ‚ÄÚRECRUIT‚ÄÙ; AND, INDEED, IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THEM TO PART FOR A TIME, SHE FELT THAT. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS DELIGHTED TO GO.

‚ÄÚTHERE I SHALL REVIVE!‚ÄÙ HE EXCLAIMED. ‚ÄÚTHERE, AT LAST, I SHALL SET TO WORK!‚ÄÙ BUT IN THE FIRST OF HIS LETTERS FROM BERLIN HE STRUCK HIS USUAL NOTE:

‚ÄÚMY HEART IS BROKEN!‚ÄÙ HE WROTE TO VARVARA PETROVNA. ‚ÄÚI CAN FORGET NOTHING! HERE, IN BERLIN, EVERYTHING BRINGS BACK TO ME MY OLD PAST, MY FIRST RAPTURES AND MY FIRST AGONIES. WHERE IS SHE? WHERE ARE THEY BOTH? WHERE ARE YOU TWO ANGELS OF WHOM I WAS NEVER WORTHY? WHERE IS MY SON, MY BELOVED SON? AND LAST OF ALL, WHERE AM I, WHERE IS MY OLD SELF, STRONG AS STEEL, FIRM AS A ROCK, WHEN NOW SOME ANDREEV, OUR ORTHODOX CLOWN WITH A BEARD, PEUT BRISER MON EXISTENCE EN DEUX‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND SO ON.

AS FOR STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS SON, HE HAD ONLY SEEN HIM TWICE IN HIS LIFE, THE FIRST TIME WHEN HE WAS BORN AND THE SECOND TIME LATELY IN PETERSBURG, WHERE THE YOUNG MAN WAS PREPARING TO ENTER THE UNIVERSITY. THE BOY HAD BEEN ALL HIS LIFE, AS WE HAVE SAID ALREADY, BROUGHT UP BY HIS AUNTS (AT VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS EXPENSE) IN A REMOTE PROVINCE, NEARLY SIX HUNDRED MILES FROM SKVORESHNIKI. AS FOR ANDREEV, HE WAS NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN OUR LOCAL SHOPKEEPER, A VERY ECCENTRIC FELLOW, A SELF-TAUGHT ARCH√¶OLOGIST WHO HAD A PASSION FOR COLLECTING RUSSIAN ANTIQUITIES AND SOMETIMES TRIED TO OUTSHINE STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH IN ERUDITION AND IN THE PROGRESSIVENESS OF HIS OPINIONS. THIS WORTHY SHOPKEEPER, WITH A GREY BEARD AND SILVER-RIMMED SPECTACLES, STILL OWED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH FOUR HUNDRED ROUBLES FOR SOME ACRES OF TIMBER HE HAD BOUGHT ON THE LATTER‚ÄÔS LITTLE ESTATE (NEAR SKVORESHNIKI). THOUGH VARVARA PETROVNA HAD LIBERALLY PROVIDED HER FRIEND WITH FUNDS WHEN SHE SENT HIM TO BERLIN, YET STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HAD, BEFORE STARTING, PARTICULARLY RECKONED ON GETTING THAT FOUR HUNDRED ROUBLES, PROBABLY FOR HIS SECRET EXPENDITURE, AND WAS READY TO CRY WHEN ANDREEV ASKED LEAVE TO DEFER PAYMENT FOR A MONTH, WHICH HE HAD A RIGHT TO DO, SINCE HE HAD BROUGHT THE FIRST INSTALLMENTS OF THE MONEY ALMOST SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE TO MEET STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS SPECIAL NEED AT THE TIME.

VARVARA PETROVNA READ THIS FIRST LETTER GREEDILY, AND UNDERLINING IN PENCIL THE EXCLAMATION: ‚ÄÚWHERE ARE THEY BOTH?‚ÄÙ NUMBERED IT AND PUT IT AWAY IN A DRAWER. HE HAD, OF COURSE, REFERRED TO HIS TWO DECEASED WIVES. THE SECOND LETTER SHE RECEIVED FROM BERLIN WAS IN A DIFFERENT STRAIN:

‚ÄÚI AM WORKING TWELVE HOURS OUT OF THE TWENTY-FOUR.‚ÄÙ (‚ÄÚELEVEN WOULD BE ENOUGH,‚ÄÙ MUTTERED VARVARA PETROVNA.) ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM RUMMAGING IN THE LIBRARIES, COLLATING, COPYING, RUSHING ABOUT. I‚ÄÔVE VISITED THE PROFESSORS. I HAVE RENEWED MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE DELIGHTFUL DUNDASOV FAMILY. WHAT A CHARMING CREATURE LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA IS EVEN NOW! SHE SENDS YOU HER GREETINGS. HER YOUNG HUSBAND AND THREE NEPHEWS ARE ALL IN BERLIN. I SIT UP TALKING TILL DAYBREAK WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND WE HAVE ALMOST ATHENIAN EVENINGS, ATHENIAN, I MEAN, ONLY IN THEIR INTELLECTUAL SUBTLETY AND REFINEMENT. EVERYTHING IS IN NOBLE STYLE; A GREAT DEAL OF MUSIC, SPANISH AIRS, DREAMS OF THE REGENERATION OF ALL HUMANITY, IDEAS OF ETERNAL BEAUTY, OF THE SISTINE MADONNA, LIGHT INTERSPERSED WITH DARKNESS, BUT THERE ARE SPOTS EVEN ON THE SUN! OH, MY FRIEND, MY NOBLE, FAITHFUL FRIEND! IN HEART I AM WITH YOU AND AM YOURS; WITH YOU ALONE, ALWAYS, EN TOUT PAYS, EVEN IN LE PAYS DE MAKAR ET DE SES VEAUX, OF WHICH WE OFTEN USED TO TALK IN AGITATION IN PETERSBURG, DO YOU REMEMBER, BEFORE WE CAME AWAY. I THINK OF IT WITH A SMILE. CROSSING THE FRONTIER I FELT MYSELF IN SAFETY, A SENSATION, STRANGE AND NEW, FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER SO MANY YEARS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND SO ON AND SO ON.

‚ÄÚCOME, IT‚ÄÔS ALL NONSENSE!‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA COMMENTED, FOLDING UP THAT LETTER TOO. ‚ÄÚIF HE‚ÄÔS UP TILL DAYBREAK WITH HIS ATHENIAN NIGHTS, HE ISN‚ÄÔT AT HIS BOOKS FOR TWELVE HOURS A DAY. WAS HE DRUNK WHEN HE WROTE IT? THAT DUNDASOV WOMAN DARES TO SEND ME GREETINGS! BUT THERE, LET HIM AMUSE HIMSELF!‚ÄÙ

THE PHRASE ‚ÄÚDANS LE PAYS DE MAKAR ET DE SES VEAUX‚ÄÙ MEANT: ‚ÄÚWHEREVER MAKAR MAY DRIVE HIS CALVES.‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SOMETIMES PURPOSELY TRANSLATED RUSSIAN PROVERBS AND TRADITIONAL SAYINGS INTO FRENCH IN THE MOST STUPID WAY, THOUGH NO DOUBT HE WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND TRANSLATE THEM BETTER. BUT HE DID IT FROM A FEELING THAT IT WAS CHIC, AND THOUGHT IT WITTY.

BUT HE DID NOT AMUSE HIMSELF FOR LONG. HE COULD NOT HOLD OUT FOR FOUR MONTHS, AND WAS SOON FLYING BACK TO SKVORESHNIKI. HIS LAST LETTERS CONSISTED OF NOTHING BUT OUTPOURINGS OF THE MOST SENTIMENTAL LOVE FOR HIS ABSENT FRIEND, AND WERE LITERALLY WET WITH TEARS. THERE ARE NATURES EXTREMELY ATTACHED TO HOME LIKE LAP-DOGS. THE MEETING OF THE FRIENDS WAS ENTHUSIASTIC. WITHIN TWO DAYS EVERYTHING WAS AS BEFORE AND EVEN DULLER THAN BEFORE. ‚ÄÚMY FRIEND,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SAID TO ME A FORTNIGHT AFTER, IN DEAD SECRET, ‚ÄÚI HAVE DISCOVERED SOMETHING AWFUL FOR ME ‚Ä¶ SOMETHING NEW: JE SUIS UN SIMPLE DEPENDENT, ET RIEN DE PLUS! MAIS R-R-RIEN DE PLUS.‚ÄÙ

VIII

AFTER THIS WE HAD A PERIOD OF STAGNATION WHICH LASTED NINE YEARS. THE HYSTERICAL OUTBREAKS AND SOBBINGS ON MY SHOULDER THAT RECURRED AT REGULAR INTERVALS DID NOT IN THE LEAST MAR OUR PROSPERITY. I WONDER THAT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH DID NOT GROW STOUT DURING THIS PERIOD. HIS NOSE WAS A LITTLE REDDER, AND HIS MANNER HAD GAINED IN URBANITY, THAT WAS ALL. BY DEGREES A CIRCLE OF FRIENDS HAD FORMED AROUND HIM, ALTHOUGH IT WAS NEVER A VERY LARGE ONE. THOUGH VARVARA PETROVNA HAD LITTLE TO DO WITH THE CIRCLE, YET WE ALL RECOGNISED HER AS OUR PATRONESS. AFTER THE LESSON SHE HAD RECEIVED IN PETERSBURG, SHE SETTLED DOWN IN OUR TOWN FOR GOOD. IN WINTER SHE LIVED IN HER TOWN HOUSE AND SPENT THE SUMMER ON HER ESTATE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD. SHE HAD NEVER ENJOYED SO MUCH CONSEQUENCE AND PRESTIGE IN OUR PROVINCIAL SOCIETY AS DURING THE LAST SEVEN YEARS OF THIS PERIOD, THAT IS UP TO THE TIME OF THE APPOINTMENT OF OUR PRESENT GOVERNOR. OUR FORMER GOVERNOR, THE MILD IVAN OSSIPOVITCH, WHO WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN AMONG US, WAS A NEAR RELATION OF VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS, AND HAD AT ONE TIME BEEN UNDER OBLIGATIONS TO HER. HIS WIFE TREMBLED AT THE VERY THOUGHT OF DISPLEASING HER, WHILE THE HOMAGE PAID HER BY PROVINCIAL SOCIETY WAS CARRIED ALMOST TO A PITCH THAT SUGGESTED IDOLATRY. SO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, TOO, HAD A GOOD TIME. HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE CLUB, LOST AT CARDS MAJESTICALLY, AND WAS EVERYWHERE TREATED WITH RESPECT, THOUGH MANY PEOPLE REGARDED HIM ONLY AS A ‚ÄÚLEARNED MAN.‚ÄÙ LATER ON, WHEN VARVARA PETROVNA ALLOWED HIM TO LIVE IN A SEPARATE HOUSE, WE ENJOYED GREATER FREEDOM THAN BEFORE. TWICE A WEEK WE USED TO MEET AT HIS HOUSE. WE WERE A MERRY PARTY, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE WAS NOT SPARING OF THE CHAMPAGNE. THE WINE CAME FROM THE SHOP OF THE SAME ANDREEV. THE BILL WAS PAID TWICE A YEAR BY VARVARA PETROVNA, AND ON THE DAY IT WAS PAID STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH ALMOST INVARIABLY SUFFERED FROM AN ATTACK OF HIS ‚ÄÚSUMMER CHOLERA.‚ÄÙ

ONE OF THE FIRST MEMBERS OF OUR CIRCLE WAS LIPUTIN, AN ELDERLY PROVINCIAL OFFICIAL, AND A GREAT LIBERAL, WHO WAS REPUTED IN THE TOWN TO BE AN ATHEIST. HE HAD MARRIED FOR THE SECOND TIME A YOUNG AND PRETTY WIFE WITH A DOWRY, AND HAD, BESIDES, THREE GROWN-UP DAUGHTERS. HE BROUGHT UP HIS FAMILY IN THE FEAR OF GOD, AND KEPT A TIGHT HAND OVER THEM. HE WAS EXTREMELY STINGY, AND OUT OF HIS SALARY HAD BOUGHT HIMSELF A HOUSE AND AMASSED A FORTUNE. HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE SORT OF MAN, AND HAD NOT BEEN IN THE SERVICE. HE WAS NOT MUCH RESPECTED IN THE TOWN, AND WAS NOT RECEIVED IN THE BEST CIRCLES. MOREOVER, HE WAS A SCANDAL-MONGER, AND HAD MORE THAN ONCE HAD TO SMART FOR HIS BACK-BITING, FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN BADLY PUNISHED BY AN OFFICER, AND AGAIN BY A COUNTRY GENTLEMAN, THE RESPECTABLE HEAD OF A FAMILY. BUT WE LIKED HIS WIT, HIS INQUIRING MIND, HIS PECULIAR, MALICIOUS LIVELINESS. VARVARA PETROVNA DISLIKED HIM, BUT HE ALWAYS KNEW HOW TO MAKE UP TO HER.

NOR DID SHE CARE FOR SHATOV, WHO BECAME ONE OF OUR CIRCLE DURING THE LAST YEARS OF THIS PERIOD. SHATOV HAD BEEN A STUDENT AND HAD BEEN EXPELLED FROM THE UNIVERSITY AFTER SOME DISTURBANCE. IN HIS CHILDHOOD HE HAD BEEN A STUDENT OF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS AND WAS BY BIRTH A SERF OF VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS, THE SON OF A FORMER VALET OF HERS, PAVEL FYODORITCH, AND WAS GREATLY INDEBTED TO HER BOUNTY. SHE DISLIKED HIM FOR HIS PRIDE AND INGRATITUDE AND COULD NEVER FORGIVE HIM FOR NOT HAVING COME STRAIGHT TO HER ON HIS EXPULSION FROM THE UNIVERSITY. ON THE CONTRARY HE HAD NOT EVEN ANSWERED THE LETTER SHE HAD EXPRESSLY SENT HIM AT THE TIME, AND PREFERRED TO BE A DRUDGE IN THE FAMILY OF A MERCHANT OF THE NEW STYLE, WITH WHOM HE WENT ABROAD, LOOKING AFTER HIS CHILDREN MORE IN THE POSITION OF A NURSE THAN OF A TUTOR. HE WAS VERY EAGER TO TRAVEL AT THE TIME. THE CHILDREN HAD A GOVERNESS TOO, A LIVELY YOUNG RUSSIAN LADY, WHO ALSO BECAME ONE OF THE HOUSEHOLD ON THE EVE OF THEIR DEPARTURE, AND HAD BEEN ENGAGED CHIEFLY BECAUSE SHE WAS SO CHEAP. TWO MONTHS LATER THE MERCHANT TURNED HER OUT OF THE HOUSE FOR ‚ÄÚFREE THINKING.‚ÄÙ SHATOV TOOK HIMSELF OFF AFTER HER AND SOON AFTERWARDS MARRIED HER IN GENEVA. THEY LIVED TOGETHER ABOUT THREE WEEKS, AND THEN PARTED AS FREE PEOPLE RECOGNISING NO BONDS, THOUGH, NO DOUBT, ALSO THROUGH POVERTY. HE WANDERED ABOUT EUROPE ALONE FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARDS, LIVING GOD KNOWS HOW; HE IS SAID TO HAVE BLACKED BOOTS IN THE STREET, AND TO HAVE BEEN A PORTER IN SOME DOCKYARD. AT LAST, A YEAR BEFORE, HE HAD RETURNED TO HIS NATIVE PLACE AMONG US AND SETTLED WITH AN OLD AUNT, WHOM HE BURIED A MONTH LATER. HIS SISTER DASHA, WHO HAD ALSO BEEN BROUGHT UP BY VARVARA PETROVNA, WAS A FAVOURITE OF HERS, AND TREATED WITH RESPECT AND CONSIDERATION IN HER HOUSE. HE SAW HIS SISTER RARELY AND WAS NOT ON INTIMATE TERMS WITH HER. IN OUR CIRCLE HE WAS ALWAYS SULLEN, AND NEVER TALKATIVE; BUT FROM TIME TO TIME, WHEN HIS CONVICTIONS WERE TOUCHED UPON, HE BECAME MORBIDLY IRRITABLE AND VERY UNRESTRAINED IN HIS LANGUAGE.

‚ÄÚONE HAS TO TIE SHATOV UP AND THEN ARGUE WITH HIM,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WOULD SOMETIMES SAY IN JOKE, BUT HE LIKED HIM.

SHATOV HAD RADICALLY CHANGED SOME OF HIS FORMER SOCIALISTIC CONVICTIONS ABROAD AND HAD RUSHED TO THE OPPOSITE EXTREME. HE WAS ONE OF THOSE IDEALISTIC BEINGS COMMON IN RUSSIA, WHO ARE SUDDENLY STRUCK BY SOME OVERMASTERING IDEA WHICH SEEMS, AS IT WERE, TO CRUSH THEM AT ONCE, AND SOMETIMES FOREVER. THEY ARE NEVER EQUAL TO COPING WITH IT, BUT PUT PASSIONATE FAITH IN IT, AND THEIR WHOLE LIFE PASSES AFTERWARDS, AS IT WERE, IN THE LAST AGONIES UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE STONE THAT HAS FALLEN UPON THEM AND HALF CRUSHED THEM. IN APPEARANCE SHATOV WAS IN COMPLETE HARMONY WITH HIS CONVICTIONS: HE WAS SHORT, AWKWARD, HAD A SHOCK OF FLAXEN HAIR, BROAD SHOULDERS, THICK LIPS, VERY THICK OVERHANGING WHITE EYEBROWS, A WRINKLED FOREHEAD, AND A HOSTILE, OBSTINATELY DOWNCAST, AS IT WERE SHAMEFACED, EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES. HIS HAIR WAS ALWAYS IN A WILD TANGLE AND STOOD UP IN A SHOCK WHICH NOTHING COULD SMOOTH. HE WAS SEVEN- OR EIGHT-AND-TWENTY.

‚ÄÚI NO LONGER WONDER THAT HIS WIFE RAN AWAY FROM HIM,‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA ENUNCIATED ON ONE OCCASION AFTER GAZING INTENTLY AT HIM. HE TRIED TO BE NEAT IN HIS DRESS, IN SPITE OF HIS EXTREME POVERTY. HE REFRAINED AGAIN FROM APPEALING TO VARVARA PETROVNA, AND STRUGGLED ALONG AS BEST HE COULD, DOING VARIOUS JOBS FOR TRADESPEOPLE. AT ONE TIME HE SERVED IN A SHOP, AT ANOTHER HE WAS ON THE POINT OF GOING AS AN ASSISTANT CLERK ON A FREIGHT STEAMER, BUT HE FELL ILL JUST AT THE TIME OF SAILING. IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT POVERTY HE WAS CAPABLE OF ENDURING WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT AT ALL. AFTER HIS ILLNESS VARVARA PETROVNA SENT HIM A HUNDRED ROUBLES, ANONYMOUSLY AND IN SECRET. HE FOUND OUT THE SECRET, HOWEVER, AND AFTER SOME REFLECTION TOOK THE MONEY AND WENT TO VARVARA PETROVNA TO THANK HER. SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH WARMTH, BUT ON THIS OCCASION, TOO, HE SHAMEFULLY DISAPPOINTED HER. HE ONLY STAYED FIVE MINUTES, STARING BLANKLY AT THE GROUND AND SMILING STUPIDLY IN PROFOUND SILENCE, AND SUDDENLY, AT THE MOST INTERESTING POINT, WITHOUT LISTENING TO WHAT SHE WAS SAYING, HE GOT UP, MADE AN UNCOUTH SIDEWAYS BOW, HELPLESS WITH CONFUSION, CAUGHT AGAINST THE LADY‚ÄÔS EXPENSIVE INLAID WORK-TABLE, UPSETTING IT ON THE FLOOR AND SMASHING IT TO ATOMS, AND WALKED OUT NEARLY DEAD WITH SHAME. LIPUTIN BLAMED HIM SEVERELY AFTERWARDS FOR HAVING ACCEPTED THE HUNDRED ROUBLES AND HAVING EVEN GONE TO THANK VARVARA PETROVNA FOR THEM, INSTEAD OF HAVING RETURNED THE MONEY WITH CONTEMPT, BECAUSE IT HAD COME FROM HIS FORMER DESPOTIC MISTRESS. HE LIVED IN SOLITUDE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE TOWN, AND DID NOT LIKE ANY OF US TO GO AND SEE HIM. HE USED TO TURN UP INVARIABLY AT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS EVENINGS, AND BORROWED NEWSPAPERS AND BOOKS FROM HIM.

THERE WAS ANOTHER YOUNG MAN WHO ALWAYS CAME, ONE VIRGINSKY, A CLERK IN THE SERVICE HERE, WHO HAD SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH SHATOV, THOUGH ON THE SURFACE HE SEEMED HIS COMPLETE OPPOSITE IN EVERY RESPECT. HE WAS A ‚ÄÚFAMILY MAN‚ÄÙ TOO. HE WAS A PATHETIC AND VERY QUIET YOUNG MAN THOUGH HE WAS THIRTY; HE HAD CONSIDERABLE EDUCATION THOUGH HE WAS CHIEFLY SELF-TAUGHT. HE WAS POOR, MARRIED, AND IN THE SERVICE, AND SUPPORTED THE AUNT AND SISTER OF HIS WIFE. HIS WIFE AND ALL THE LADIES OF HIS FAMILY PROFESSED THE VERY LATEST CONVICTIONS, BUT IN RATHER A CRUDE FORM. IT WAS A CASE OF ‚ÄÚAN IDEA DRAGGED FORTH INTO THE STREET,‚ÄÙ AS STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HAD EXPRESSED IT UPON A FORMER OCCASION. THEY GOT IT ALL OUT OF BOOKS, AND AT THE FIRST HINT COMING FROM ANY OF OUR LITTLE PROGRESSIVE CORNERS IN PETERSBURG THEY WERE PREPARED TO THROW ANYTHING OVERBOARD, SO SOON AS THEY WERE ADVISED TO DO SO. MADAME VIRGINSKY PRACTISED AS A MIDWIFE IN THE TOWN. SHE HAD LIVED A LONG WHILE IN PETERSBURG AS A GIRL. VIRGINSKY HIMSELF WAS A MAN OF RARE SINGLE-HEARTEDNESS, AND I HAVE SELDOM MET MORE HONEST FERVOUR.

‚ÄÚI WILL NEVER, NEVER, ABANDON THESE BRIGHT HOPES,‚ÄÙ HE USED TO SAY TO ME WITH SHINING EYES. OF THESE ‚ÄÚBRIGHT HOPES‚ÄÙ HE ALWAYS SPOKE QUIETLY, IN A BLISSFUL HALF-WHISPER, AS IT WERE SECRETLY. HE WAS RATHER TALL, BUT EXTREMELY THIN AND NARROW-SHOULDERED, AND HAD EXTRAORDINARILY LANK HAIR OF A REDDISH HUE. ALL STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS CONDESCENDING GIBES AT SOME OF HIS OPINIONS HE ACCEPTED MILDLY, ANSWERED HIM SOMETIMES VERY SERIOUSLY, AND OFTEN NONPLUSSED HIM. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH TREATED HIM VERY KINDLY, AND INDEED HE BEHAVED LIKE A FATHER TO ALL OF US. ‚ÄÚYOU ARE ALL HALF-HEARTED CHICKENS,‚ÄÙ HE OBSERVED TO VIRGINSKY IN JOKE. ‚ÄÚALL WHO ARE LIKE YOU, THOUGH IN YOU, VIRGINSKY, I HAVE NOT OBSERVED THAT NARROW-MINDEDNESS I FOUND IN PETERSBURG, CHEZ CES S√©MINARISTES. BUT YOU‚ÄÔRE A HALF-HATCHED CHICKEN ALL THE SAME. SHATOV WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO HATCH OUT, BUT HE‚ÄÔS HALF-HATCHED TOO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND I?‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN INQUIRED.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE SIMPLY THE GOLDEN MEAN WHICH WILL GET ON ANYWHERE IN ITS OWN WAY.‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN WAS OFFENDED.

THE STORY WAS TOLD OF VIRGINSKY, AND IT WAS UNHAPPILY ONLY TOO TRUE, THAT BEFORE HIS WIFE HAD SPENT A YEAR IN LAWFUL WEDLOCK WITH HIM SHE ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS SUPERSEDED AND THAT SHE PREFERRED LEBYADKIN. THIS LEBYADKIN, A STRANGER TO THE TOWN, TURNED OUT AFTERWARDS TO BE A VERY DUBIOUS CHARACTER, AND NOT A RETIRED CAPTAIN AS HE REPRESENTED HIMSELF TO BE. HE COULD DO NOTHING BUT TWIST HIS MOUSTACHE, DRINK, AND CHATTER THE MOST INEPT NONSENSE THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE IMAGINED. THIS FELLOW, WHO WAS UTTERLY LACKING IN DELICACY, AT ONCE SETTLED IN HIS HOUSE, GLAD TO LIVE AT ANOTHER MAN‚ÄÔS EXPENSE, ATE AND SLEPT THERE AND CAME, IN THE END, TO TREATING THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WITH CONDESCENSION. IT WAS ASSERTED THAT WHEN VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS WIFE HAD ANNOUNCED TO HIM THAT HE WAS SUPERSEDED HE SAID TO HER:

‚ÄÚMY DEAR, HITHERTO I HAVE ONLY LOVED YOU, BUT NOW I RESPECT YOU,‚ÄÙ BUT I DOUBT WHETHER THIS RENUNCIATION, WORTHY OF ANCIENT ROME, WAS EVER REALLY UTTERED. ON THE CONTRARY THEY SAY THAT HE WEPT VIOLENTLY. A FORTNIGHT AFTER HE WAS SUPERSEDED, ALL OF THEM, IN A ‚ÄÚFAMILY PARTY,‚ÄÙ WENT ONE DAY FOR A PICNIC TO A WOOD OUTSIDE THE TOWN TO DRINK TEA WITH THEIR FRIENDS. VIRGINSKY WAS IN A FEVERISHLY LIVELY MOOD AND TOOK PART IN THE DANCES. BUT SUDDENLY, WITHOUT ANY PRELIMINARY QUARREL, HE SEIZED THE GIANT LEBYADKIN WITH BOTH HANDS, BY THE HAIR, JUST AS THE LATTER WAS DANCING A CAN-CAN SOLO, PUSHED HIM DOWN, AND BEGAN DRAGGING HIM ALONG WITH SHRIEKS, SHOUTS, AND TEARS. THE GIANT WAS SO PANIC-STRICKEN THAT HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO DEFEND HIMSELF, AND HARDLY UTTERED A SOUND ALL THE TIME HE WAS BEING DRAGGED ALONG. BUT AFTERWARDS HE RESENTED IT WITH ALL THE HEAT OF AN HONOURABLE MAN. VIRGINSKY SPENT A WHOLE NIGHT ON HIS KNEES BEGGING HIS WIFE‚ÄÔS FORGIVENESS. BUT THIS FORGIVENESS WAS NOT GRANTED, AS HE REFUSED TO APOLOGISE TO LEBYADKIN; MOREOVER, HE WAS UPBRAIDED FOR THE MEANNESS OF HIS IDEAS AND HIS FOOLISHNESS, THE LATTER CHARGE BASED ON THE FACT THAT HE KNELT DOWN IN THE INTERVIEW WITH HIS WIFE. THE CAPTAIN SOON DISAPPEARED AND DID NOT REAPPEAR IN OUR TOWN TILL QUITE LATELY, WHEN HE CAME WITH HIS SISTER, AND WITH ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AIMS; BUT OF HIM LATER. IT WAS NO WONDER THAT THE POOR YOUNG HUSBAND SOUGHT OUR SOCIETY AND FOUND COMFORT IN IT. BUT HE NEVER SPOKE OF HIS HOME-LIFE TO US. ON ONE OCCASION ONLY, RETURNING WITH ME FROM STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS, HE MADE A REMOTE ALLUSION TO HIS POSITION, BUT CLUTCHING MY HAND AT ONCE HE CRIED ARDENTLY:

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS OF NO CONSEQUENCE. IT‚ÄÔS ONLY A PERSONAL INCIDENT. IT‚ÄÔS NO HINDRANCE TO THE ‚ÄÒCAUSE,‚ÄÔ NOT THE SLIGHTEST!‚ÄÙ

STRAY GUESTS VISITED OUR CIRCLE TOO; A JEW, CALLED LYAMSHIN, AND A CAPTAIN KARTUSOV CAME. AN OLD GENTLEMAN OF INQUIRING MIND USED TO COME AT ONE TIME, BUT HE DIED. LIPUTIN BROUGHT AN EXILED POLISH PRIEST CALLED SLONTSEVSKY, AND FOR A TIME WE RECEIVED HIM ON PRINCIPLE, BUT AFTERWARDS WE DIDN‚ÄÔT KEEP IT UP.

IX

AT ONE TIME IT WAS REPORTED ABOUT THE TOWN THAT OUR LITTLE CIRCLE WAS A HOTBED OF NIHILISM, PROFLIGACY, AND GODLESSNESS, AND THE RUMOUR GAINED MORE AND MORE STRENGTH. AND YET WE DID NOTHING BUT INDULGE IN THE MOST HARMLESS, AGREEABLE, TYPICALLY RUSSIAN, LIGHT-HEARTED LIBERAL CHATTER. ‚ÄÚTHE HIGHER LIBERALISM‚ÄÙ AND THE ‚ÄÚHIGHER LIBERAL,‚ÄÙ THAT IS, A LIBERAL WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE AIM, IS ONLY POSSIBLE IN RUSSIA.

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, LIKE EVERY WITTY MAN, NEEDED A LISTENER, AND, BESIDES THAT, HE NEEDED THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE WAS FULFILLING THE LOFTY DUTY OF DISSEMINATING IDEAS. AND FINALLY HE HAD TO HAVE SOMEONE TO DRINK CHAMPAGNE WITH, AND OVER THE WINE TO EXCHANGE LIGHT-HEARTED VIEWS OF A CERTAIN SORT, ABOUT RUSSIA AND THE ‚ÄÚRUSSIAN SPIRIT,‚ÄÙ ABOUT GOD IN GENERAL, AND THE ‚ÄÚRUSSIAN GOD‚ÄÙ IN PARTICULAR, TO REPEAT FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME THE SAME RUSSIAN SCANDALOUS STORIES THAT EVERY ONE KNEW AND EVERY ONE REPEATED. WE HAD NO DISTASTE FOR THE GOSSIP OF THE TOWN WHICH OFTEN, INDEED, LED US TO THE MOST SEVERE AND LOFTILY MORAL VERDICTS. WE FELL INTO GENERALISING ABOUT HUMANITY, MADE STERN REFLECTIONS ON THE FUTURE OF EUROPE AND MANKIND IN GENERAL, AUTHORITATIVELY PREDICTED THAT AFTER C√¶SARISM FRANCE WOULD AT ONCE SINK INTO THE POSITION OF A SECOND-RATE POWER, AND WERE FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT THIS MIGHT TERRIBLY EASILY AND QUICKLY COME TO PASS. WE HAD LONG AGO PREDICTED THAT THE POPE WOULD PLAY THE PART OF A SIMPLE ARCHBISHOP IN A UNITED ITALY, AND WERE FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT THIS THOUSAND-YEAR-OLD QUESTION HAD, IN OUR AGE OF HUMANITARIANISM, INDUSTRY, AND RAILWAYS, BECOME A TRIFLING MATTER. BUT, OF COURSE, ‚ÄÚRUSSIAN HIGHER LIBERALISM‚ÄÙ COULD NOT LOOK AT THE QUESTION IN ANY OTHER WAY. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SOMETIMES TALKED OF ART, AND VERY WELL, THOUGH RATHER ABSTRACTLY. HE SOMETIMES SPOKE OF THE FRIENDS OF HIS YOUTH‚ÄÎALL NAMES NOTEWORTHY IN THE HISTORY OF RUSSIAN PROGRESS. HE TALKED OF THEM WITH EMOTION AND REVERENCE, THOUGH SOMETIMES WITH ENVY. IF WE WERE VERY MUCH BORED, THE JEW, LYAMSHIN (A LITTLE POST-OFFICE CLERK), A WONDERFUL PERFORMER ON THE PIANO, SAT DOWN TO PLAY, AND IN THE INTERVALS WOULD IMITATE A PIG, A THUNDERSTORM, A CONFINEMENT WITH THE FIRST CRY OF THE BABY, AND SO ON, AND SO ON; IT WAS ONLY FOR THIS THAT HE WAS INVITED, INDEED. IF WE HAD DRUNK A GREAT DEAL‚ÄÎAND THAT DID HAPPEN SOMETIMES, THOUGH NOT OFTEN‚ÄÎWE FLEW INTO RAPTURES, AND EVEN ON ONE OCCASION SANG THE ‚ÄÚMARSEILLAISE‚ÄÙ IN CHORUS TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF LYAMSHIN, THOUGH I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HOW IT WENT OFF. THE GREAT DAY, THE NINETEENTH OF FEBRUARY, WE WELCOMED ENTHUSIASTICALLY, AND FOR A LONG TIME BEFOREHAND DRANK TOASTS IN ITS HONOUR. BUT THAT WAS LONG AGO, BEFORE THE ADVENT OF SHATOV OR VIRGINSKY, WHEN STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS STILL LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH VARVARA PETROVNA. FOR SOME TIME BEFORE THE GREAT DAY STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH FELL INTO THE HABIT OF MUTTERING TO HIMSELF WELL-KNOWN, THOUGH RATHER FAR-FETCHED, LINES WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY SOME LIBERAL LANDOWNER OF THE PAST:

‚ÄÚTHE PEASANT WITH HIS AXE IS COMING, SOMETHING TERRIBLE WILL HAPPEN.‚ÄÙ

SOMETHING OF THAT SORT, I DON‚ÄÔT REMEMBER THE EXACT WORDS. VARVARA PETROVNA OVERHEARD HIM ON ONE OCCASION, AND CRYING, ‚ÄÚNONSENSE, NONSENSE!‚ÄÙ SHE WENT OUT OF THE ROOM IN A RAGE. LIPUTIN, WHO HAPPENED TO BE PRESENT, OBSERVED MALIGNANTLY TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH:

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔLL BE A PITY IF THEIR FORMER SERFS REALLY DO SOME MISCHIEF TO MESSIEURS LES LANDOWNERS TO CELEBRATE THE OCCASION,‚ÄÙ AND HE DREW HIS FOREFINGER ROUND HIS THROAT.

‚ÄÚCHER AMI,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH OBSERVED, ‚ÄÚBELIEVE ME THAT‚ÄÎTHIS (HE REPEATED THE GESTURE) WILL NEVER BE OF ANY USE TO OUR LANDOWNERS NOR TO ANY OF US IN GENERAL. WE SHALL NEVER BE CAPABLE OF ORGANISING ANYTHING EVEN WITHOUT OUR HEADS, THOUGH OUR HEADS HINDER OUR UNDERSTANDING MORE THAN ANYTHING.‚ÄÙ

I MAY OBSERVE THAT MANY PEOPLE AMONG US ANTICIPATED THAT SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY, SUCH AS LIPUTIN PREDICTED, WOULD TAKE PLACE ON THE DAY OF THE EMANCIPATION, AND THOSE WHO HELD THIS VIEW WERE THE SO-CALLED ‚ÄÚAUTHORITIES‚ÄÙ ON THE PEASANTRY AND THE GOVERNMENT. I BELIEVE STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SHARED THIS IDEA, SO MUCH SO THAT ALMOST ON THE EVE OF THE GREAT DAY HE BEGAN ASKING VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS LEAVE TO GO ABROAD; IN FACT HE BEGAN TO BE UNEASY. BUT THE GREAT DAY PASSED, AND SOME TIME PASSED AFTER IT, AND THE CONDESCENDING SMILE REAPPEARED ON STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS LIPS. IN OUR PRESENCE HE DELIVERED HIMSELF OF SOME NOTEWORTHY THOUGHTS ON THE CHARACTER OF THE RUSSIAN IN GENERAL, AND THE RUSSIAN PEASANT IN PARTICULAR.

‚ÄÚLIKE HASTY PEOPLE WE HAVE BEEN IN TOO GREAT A HURRY WITH OUR PEASANTS,‚ÄÙ HE SAID IN CONCLUSION OF A SERIES OF REMARKABLE UTTERANCES. ‚ÄÚWE HAVE MADE THEM THE FASHION, AND A WHOLE SECTION OF WRITERS HAVE FOR SEVERAL YEARS TREATED THEM AS THOUGH THEY WERE NEWLY DISCOVERED CURIOSITIES. WE HAVE PUT LAUREL-WREATHS ON LOUSY HEADS. THE RUSSIAN VILLAGE HAS GIVEN US ONLY ‚ÄÒKAMARINSKY‚ÄÔ IN A THOUSAND YEARS. A REMARKABLE RUSSIAN POET WHO WAS ALSO SOMETHING OF A WIT, SEEING THE GREAT RACHEL ON THE STAGE FOR THE FIRST TIME CRIED IN ECSTASY, ‚ÄÒI WOULDN‚ÄÔT EXCHANGE RACHEL FOR A PEASANT!‚ÄÔ I AM PREPARED TO GO FURTHER. I WOULD GIVE ALL THE PEASANTS IN RUSSIA FOR ONE RACHEL. IT‚ÄÔS HIGH TIME TO LOOK THINGS IN THE FACE MORE SOBERLY, AND NOT TO MIX UP OUR NATIONAL RUSTIC PITCH WITH BOUQUET DE L‚ÄÔIMP√©RATRICE.‚ÄÙ

LIPUTIN AGREED AT ONCE, BUT REMARKED THAT ONE HAD TO PERJURE ONESELF AND PRAISE THE PEASANT ALL THE SAME FOR THE SAKE OF BEING PROGRESSIVE, THAT EVEN LADIES IN GOOD SOCIETY SHED TEARS READING ‚ÄÚPOOR ANTON,‚ÄÙ AND THAT SOME OF THEM EVEN WROTE FROM PARIS TO THEIR BAILIFFS THAT THEY WERE, HENCEFORWARD, TO TREAT THE PEASANTS AS HUMANELY AS POSSIBLE.

IT HAPPENED, AND AS ILL-LUCK WOULD HAVE IT JUST AFTER THE RUMOURS OF THE ANTON PETROV AFFAIR HAD REACHED US, THAT THERE WAS SOME DISTURBANCE IN OUR PROVINCE TOO, ONLY ABOUT TEN MILES FROM SKVORESHNIKI, SO THAT A DETACHMENT OF SOLDIERS WAS SENT DOWN IN A HURRY.

THIS TIME STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS SO MUCH UPSET THAT HE EVEN FRIGHTENED US. HE CRIED OUT AT THE CLUB THAT MORE TROOPS WERE NEEDED, THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE TELEGRAPHED FOR FROM ANOTHER PROVINCE; HE RUSHED OFF TO THE GOVERNOR TO PROTEST THAT HE HAD NO HAND IN IT, BEGGED HIM NOT TO ALLOW HIS NAME ON ACCOUNT OF OLD ASSOCIATIONS TO BE BROUGHT INTO IT, AND OFFERED TO WRITE ABOUT HIS PROTEST TO THE PROPER QUARTER IN PETERSBURG. FORTUNATELY IT ALL PASSED OVER QUICKLY AND ENDED IN NOTHING, BUT I WAS SURPRISED AT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH AT THE TIME.

THREE YEARS LATER, AS EVERY ONE KNOWS, PEOPLE WERE BEGINNING TO TALK OF NATIONALISM, AND ‚ÄÚPUBLIC OPINION‚ÄÙ FIRST CAME UPON THE SCENE. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH LAUGHED A GREAT DEAL.

‚ÄÚMY FRIENDS,‚ÄÙ HE INSTRUCTED US, ‚ÄÚIF OUR NATIONALISM HAS ‚ÄÒDAWNED‚ÄÔ AS THEY KEEP REPEATING IN THE PAPERS‚ÄÎIT‚ÄÔS STILL AT SCHOOL, AT SOME GERMAN ‚ÄÒPETERSCHULE,‚ÄÔ SITTING OVER A GERMAN BOOK AND REPEATING ITS EVERLASTING GERMAN LESSON, AND ITS GERMAN TEACHER WILL MAKE IT GO DOWN ON ITS KNEES WHEN HE THINKS FIT. I THINK HIGHLY OF THE GERMAN TEACHER. BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED AND NOTHING OF THE KIND HAS DAWNED AND EVERYTHING IS GOING ON IN THE OLD WAY, THAT IS, AS ORDAINED BY GOD. TO MY THINKING THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR RUSSIA, POUR NOTRE SAINTE RUSSIE. BESIDES, ALL THIS SLAVISM AND NATIONALISM IS TOO OLD TO BE NEW. NATIONALISM, IF YOU LIKE, HAS NEVER EXISTED AMONG US EXCEPT AS A DISTRACTION FOR GENTLEMEN‚ÄÔS CLUBS, AND MOSCOW ONES AT THAT. I‚ÄÔM NOT TALKING OF THE DAYS OF IGOR, OF COURSE. AND BESIDES IT ALL COMES OF IDLENESS. EVERYTHING IN RUSSIA COMES OF IDLENESS, EVERYTHING GOOD AND FINE EVEN. IT ALL SPRINGS FROM THE CHARMING, CULTURED, WHIMSICAL IDLENESS OF OUR GENTRY! I‚ÄÔM READY TO REPEAT IT FOR THIRTY THOUSAND YEARS. WE DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HOW TO LIVE BY OUR OWN LABOUR. AND AS FOR THE FUSS THEY‚ÄÔRE MAKING NOW ABOUT THE ‚ÄÒDAWN‚ÄÔ OF SOME SORT OF PUBLIC OPINION, HAS IT SO SUDDENLY DROPPED FROM HEAVEN WITHOUT ANY WARNING? HOW IS IT THEY DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND THAT BEFORE WE CAN HAVE AN OPINION OF OUR OWN WE MUST HAVE WORK, OUR OWN WORK, OUR OWN INITIATIVE IN THINGS, OUR OWN EXPERIENCE. NOTHING IS TO BE GAINED FOR NOTHING. IF WE WORK WE SHALL HAVE AN OPINION OF OUR OWN. BUT AS WE NEVER SHALL WORK, OUR OPINIONS WILL BE FORMED FOR US BY THOSE WHO HAVE HITHERTO DONE THE WORK INSTEAD OF US, THAT IS, AS ALWAYS, EUROPE, THE EVERLASTING GERMANS‚ÄÎOUR TEACHERS FOR THE LAST TWO CENTURIES. MOREOVER, RUSSIA IS TOO BIG A TANGLE FOR US TO UNRAVEL ALONE WITHOUT THE GERMANS, AND WITHOUT HARD WORK. FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS I‚ÄÔVE BEEN SOUNDING THE ALARM, AND THE SUMMONS TO WORK. I‚ÄÔVE GIVEN UP MY LIFE TO THAT APPEAL, AND, IN MY FOLLY I PUT FAITH IN IT. NOW I HAVE LOST FAITH IN IT, BUT I SOUND THE ALARM STILL, AND SHALL SOUND IT TO THE TOMB. I WILL PULL AT THE BELL-ROPES UNTIL THEY TOLL FOR MY OWN REQUIEM!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚALAS! WE COULD DO NOTHING BUT ASSENT. WE APPLAUDED OUR TEACHER AND WITH WHAT WARMTH, INDEED! AND, AFTER ALL, MY FRIENDS, DON‚ÄÔT WE STILL HEAR TO-DAY, EVERY HOUR, AT EVERY STEP, THE SAME ‚ÄÚCHARMING,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚCLEVER,‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚLIBERAL,‚ÄÙ OLD RUSSIAN NONSENSE? OUR TEACHER BELIEVED IN GOD.

‚ÄÚI CAN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY MAKE ME OUT AN INFIDEL HERE,‚ÄÙ HE USED TO SAY SOMETIMES. ‚ÄÚI BELIEVE IN GOD, MAIS DISTINGUONS, I BELIEVE IN HIM AS A BEING WHO IS CONSCIOUS OF HIMSELF IN ME ONLY. I CANNOT BELIEVE AS MY NASTASYA (THE SERVANT) OR LIKE SOME COUNTRY GENTLEMAN WHO BELIEVES ‚ÄÒTO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE,‚ÄÔ OR LIKE OUR DEAR SHATOV‚ÄÎBUT NO, SHATOV DOESN‚ÄÔT COME INTO IT. SHATOV BELIEVES ‚ÄÒON PRINCIPLE,‚ÄÔ LIKE A MOSCOW SLAVOPHIL. AS FOR CHRISTIANITY, FOR ALL MY GENUINE RESPECT FOR IT, I‚ÄÔM NOT A CHRISTIAN. I AM MORE OF AN ANTIQUE PAGAN, LIKE THE GREAT GOETHE, OR LIKE AN ANCIENT GREEK. THE VERY FACT THAT CHRISTIANITY HAS FAILED TO UNDERSTAND WOMAN IS ENOUGH, AS GEORGE SAND HAS SO SPLENDIDLY SHOWN IN ONE OF HER GREAT NOVELS. AS FOR THE BOWINGS, FASTING AND ALL THE REST OF IT, I DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO WITH ME. HOWEVER BUSY THE INFORMERS MAY BE HERE, I DON‚ÄÔT CARE TO BECOME A JESUIT. IN THE YEAR 1847 BYELINSKY, WHO WAS ABROAD, SENT HIS FAMOUS LETTER TO GOGOL, AND WARMLY REPROACHED HIM FOR BELIEVING IN SOME SORT OF GOD. ENTRE NOUS SOIT DIT, I CAN IMAGINE NOTHING MORE COMIC THAN THE MOMENT WHEN GOGOL (THE GOGOL OF THAT PERIOD!) READ THAT PHRASE, AND ‚Ä¶ THE WHOLE LETTER! BUT DISMISSING THE HUMOROUS ASPECT, AND, AS I AM FUNDAMENTALLY IN AGREEMENT, I POINT TO THEM AND SAY‚ÄÎTHESE WERE MEN! THEY KNEW HOW TO LOVE THEIR PEOPLE, THEY KNEW HOW TO SUFFER FOR THEM, THEY KNEW HOW TO SACRIFICE EVERYTHING FOR THEM, YET THEY KNEW HOW TO DIFFER FROM THEM WHEN THEY OUGHT, AND DID NOT FILCH CERTAIN IDEAS FROM THEM. COULD BYELINSKY HAVE SOUGHT SALVATION IN LENTEN OIL, OR PEAS WITH RADISH!‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ BUT AT THIS POINT SHATOV INTERPOSED.

‚ÄÚTHOSE MEN OF YOURS NEVER LOVED THE PEOPLE, THEY DIDN‚ÄÔT SUFFER FOR THEM, AND DIDN‚ÄÔT SACRIFICE ANYTHING FOR THEM, THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE AMUSED THEMSELVES BY IMAGINING IT!‚ÄÙ HE GROWLED SULLENLY, LOOKING DOWN, AND MOVING IMPATIENTLY IN HIS CHAIR.

‚ÄÚTHEY DIDN‚ÄÔT LOVE THE PEOPLE!‚ÄÙ YELLED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. ‚ÄÚOH, HOW THEY LOVED RUSSIA!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNEITHER RUSSIA NOR THE PEOPLE!‚ÄÙ SHATOV YELLED TOO, WITH FLASHING EYES. ‚ÄÚYOU CAN‚ÄÔT LOVE WHAT YOU DON‚ÄÔT KNOW AND THEY HAD NO CONCEPTION OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE. ALL OF THEM PEERED AT THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE THROUGH THEIR FINGERS, AND YOU DO TOO; BYELINSKY ESPECIALLY: FROM THAT VERY LETTER TO GOGOL ONE CAN SEE IT. BYELINSKY, LIKE THE INQUISITIVE MAN IN KRYLOV‚ÄÔS FABLE, DID NOT NOTICE THE ELEPHANT IN THE MUSEUM OF CURIOSITIES, BUT CONCENTRATED HIS WHOLE ATTENTION ON THE FRENCH SOCIALIST BEETLES; HE DID NOT GET BEYOND THEM. AND YET PERHAPS HE WAS CLEVERER THAN ANY OF YOU. YOU‚ÄÔVE NOT ONLY OVERLOOKED THE PEOPLE, YOU‚ÄÔVE TAKEN UP AN ATTITUDE OF DISGUSTING CONTEMPT FOR THEM, IF ONLY BECAUSE YOU COULD NOT IMAGINE ANY BUT THE FRENCH PEOPLE, THE PARISIANS INDEED, AND WERE ASHAMED THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE NOT LIKE THEM. THAT‚ÄÔS THE NAKED TRUTH. AND HE WHO HAS NO PEOPLE HAS NO GOD. YOU MAY BE SURE THAT ALL WHO CEASE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN PEOPLE AND LOSE THEIR CONNECTION WITH THEM AT ONCE LOSE TO THE SAME EXTENT THE FAITH OF THEIR FATHERS, AND BECOME ATHEISTIC OR INDIFFERENT. I‚ÄÔM SPEAKING THE TRUTH! THIS IS A FACT WHICH WILL BE REALISED. THAT‚ÄÔS WHY ALL OF YOU AND ALL OF US NOW ARE EITHER BEASTLY ATHEISTS OR CARELESS, DISSOLUTE IMBECILES, AND NOTHING MORE. AND YOU TOO, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, I DON‚ÄÔT MAKE AN EXCEPTION OF YOU AT ALL! IN FACT, IT IS ON YOUR ACCOUNT I AM SPEAKING, LET ME TELL YOU THAT!‚ÄÙ

AS A RULE, AFTER UTTERING SUCH MONOLOGUES (WHICH HAPPENED TO HIM PRETTY FREQUENTLY) SHATOV SNATCHED UP HIS CAP AND RUSHED TO THE DOOR, IN THE FULL CONVICTION THAT EVERYTHING WAS NOW OVER, AND THAT HE HAD CUT SHORT ALL FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH FOREVER. BUT THE LATTER ALWAYS SUCCEEDED IN STOPPING HIM IN TIME.

‚ÄÚHADN‚ÄÔT WE BETTER MAKE IT UP, SHATOV, AFTER ALL THESE ENDEARMENTS,‚ÄÙ HE WOULD SAY, BENIGNLY HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO HIM FROM HIS ARM-CHAIR.

SHATOV, CLUMSY AND BASHFUL, DISLIKED SENTIMENTALITY. EXTERNALLY HE WAS ROUGH, BUT INWARDLY, I BELIEVE, HE HAD GREAT DELICACY. ALTHOUGH HE OFTEN WENT TOO FAR, HE WAS THE FIRST TO SUFFER FOR IT. MUTTERING SOMETHING BETWEEN HIS TEETH IN RESPONSE TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS APPEAL, AND SHUFFLING WITH HIS FEET LIKE A BEAR, HE GAVE A SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED SMILE, PUT DOWN HIS CAP, AND SAT DOWN IN THE SAME CHAIR AS BEFORE, WITH HIS EYES STUBBORNLY FIXED ON THE GROUND. WINE WAS, OF COURSE, BROUGHT IN, AND STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH PROPOSED SOME SUITABLE TOAST, FOR INSTANCE THE MEMORY OF SOME LEADING MAN OF THE PAST.





CHAPTER II. PRINCE HARRY. MATCHMAKING.

I

THERE WAS ANOTHER BEING IN THE WORLD TO WHOM VARVARA PETROVNA WAS AS MUCH ATTACHED AS SHE WAS TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, HER ONLY SON, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH STAVROGIN. IT WAS TO UNDERTAKE HIS EDUCATION THAT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HAD BEEN ENGAGED. THE BOY WAS AT THAT TIME EIGHT YEARS OLD, AND HIS FRIVOLOUS FATHER, GENERAL STAVROGIN, WAS ALREADY LIVING APART FROM VARVARA PETROVNA, SO THAT THE CHILD GREW UP ENTIRELY IN HIS MOTHER‚ÄÔS CARE. TO DO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH JUSTICE, HE KNEW HOW TO WIN HIS PUPIL‚ÄÔS HEART. THE WHOLE SECRET OF THIS LAY IN THE FACT THAT HE WAS A CHILD HIMSELF. I WAS NOT THERE IN THOSE DAYS, AND HE CONTINUALLY FELT THE WANT OF A REAL FRIEND. HE DID NOT HESITATE TO MAKE A FRIEND OF THIS LITTLE CREATURE AS SOON AS HE HAD GROWN A LITTLE OLDER. IT SOMEHOW CAME TO PASS QUITE NATURALLY THAT THERE SEEMED TO BE NO DISCREPANCY OF AGE BETWEEN THEM. MORE THAN ONCE HE AWAKED HIS TEN- OR ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD FRIEND AT NIGHT, SIMPLY TO POUR OUT HIS WOUNDED FEELINGS AND WEEP BEFORE HIM, OR TO TELL HIM SOME FAMILY SECRET, WITHOUT REALISING THAT THIS WAS AN OUTRAGEOUS PROCEEDING. THEY THREW THEMSELVES INTO EACH OTHER‚ÄÔS ARMS AND WEPT. THE BOY KNEW THAT HIS MOTHER LOVED HIM VERY MUCH, BUT I DOUBT WHETHER HE CARED MUCH FOR HER. SHE TALKED LITTLE TO HIM AND DID NOT OFTEN INTERFERE WITH HIM, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS MORBIDLY CONSCIOUS OF HER INTENT, SEARCHING EYES FIXED UPON HIM. YET THE MOTHER CONFIDED HIS WHOLE INSTRUCTION AND MORAL EDUCATION TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. AT THAT TIME HER FAITH IN HIM WAS UNSHAKEN. ONE CAN‚ÄÔT HELP BELIEVING THAT THE TUTOR HAD RATHER A BAD INFLUENCE ON HIS PUPIL‚ÄÔS NERVES. WHEN AT SIXTEEN HE WAS TAKEN TO A LYCEUM HE WAS FRAGILE-LOOKING AND PALE, STRANGELY QUIET AND DREAMY. (LATER ON HE WAS DISTINGUISHED BY GREAT PHYSICAL STRENGTH.) ONE MUST ASSUME TOO THAT THE FRIENDS WENT ON WEEPING AT NIGHT, THROWING THEMSELVES IN EACH OTHER‚ÄÔS ARMS, THOUGH THEIR TEARS WERE NOT ALWAYS DUE TO DOMESTIC DIFFICULTIES. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SUCCEEDED IN REACHING THE DEEPEST CHORDS IN HIS PUPIL‚ÄÔS HEART, AND HAD AROUSED IN HIM A VAGUE SENSATION OF THAT ETERNAL, SACRED YEARNING WHICH SOME ELECT SOULS CAN NEVER GIVE UP FOR CHEAP GRATIFICATION WHEN ONCE THEY HAVE TASTED AND KNOWN IT. (THERE ARE SOME CONNOISSEURS WHO PRIZE THIS YEARNING MORE THAN THE MOST COMPLETE SATISFACTION OF IT, IF SUCH WERE POSSIBLE.) BUT IN ANY CASE IT WAS JUST AS WELL THAT THE PUPIL AND THE PRECEPTOR WERE, THOUGH NONE TOO SOON, PARTED.

FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS THE LAD USED TO COME HOME FROM THE LYCEUM FOR THE HOLIDAYS. WHILE VARVARA PETROVNA AND STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WERE STAYING IN PETERSBURG HE WAS SOMETIMES PRESENT AT THE LITERARY EVENINGS AT HIS MOTHER‚ÄÔS, HE LISTENED AND LOOKED ON. HE SPOKE LITTLE, AND WAS QUIET AND SHY AS BEFORE. HIS MANNER TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS AS AFFECTIONATELY ATTENTIVE AS EVER, BUT THERE WAS A SHADE OF RESERVE IN IT. HE UNMISTAKABLY AVOIDED DISTRESSING, LOFTY SUBJECTS OR REMINISCENCES OF THE PAST. BY HIS MOTHER‚ÄÔS WISH HE ENTERED THE ARMY ON COMPLETING THE SCHOOL COURSE, AND SOON RECEIVED A COMMISSION IN ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT REGIMENTS OF THE HORSE GUARDS. HE DID NOT COME TO SHOW HIMSELF TO HIS MOTHER IN HIS UNIFORM, AND HIS LETTERS FROM PETERSBURG BEGAN TO BE INFREQUENT. VARVARA PETROVNA SENT HIM MONEY WITHOUT STINT, THOUGH AFTER THE EMANCIPATION THE REVENUE FROM HER ESTATE WAS SO DIMINISHED THAT AT FIRST HER INCOME WAS LESS THAN HALF WHAT IT HAD BEEN BEFORE. SHE HAD, HOWEVER, A CONSIDERABLE SUM LAID BY THROUGH YEARS OF ECONOMY. SHE TOOK GREAT INTEREST IN HER SON‚ÄÔS SUCCESS IN THE HIGHEST PETERSBURG SOCIETY. WHERE SHE HAD FAILED, THE WEALTHY YOUNG OFFICER WITH EXPECTATIONS SUCCEEDED. HE RENEWED ACQUAINTANCES WHICH SHE HAD HARDLY DARED TO DREAM OF, AND WAS WELCOMED EVERYWHERE WITH PLEASURE. BUT VERY SOON RATHER STRANGE RUMOURS REACHED VARVARA PETROVNA. THE YOUNG MAN HAD SUDDENLY TAKEN TO RIOTOUS LIVING WITH A SORT OF FRENZY. NOT THAT HE GAMBLED OR DRANK TOO MUCH; THERE WAS ONLY TALK OF SAVAGE RECKLESSNESS, OF RUNNING OVER PEOPLE IN THE STREET WITH HIS HORSES, OF BRUTAL CONDUCT TO A LADY OF GOOD SOCIETY WITH WHOM HE HAD A LIAISON AND WHOM HE AFTERWARDS PUBLICLY INSULTED. THERE WAS A CALLOUS NASTINESS ABOUT THIS AFFAIR. IT WAS ADDED, TOO, THAT HE HAD DEVELOPED INTO A REGULAR BULLY, INSULTING PEOPLE FOR THE MERE PLEASURE OF INSULTING THEM. VARVARA PETROVNA WAS GREATLY AGITATED AND DISTRESSED. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH ASSURED HER THAT THIS WAS ONLY THE FIRST RIOTOUS EFFERVESCENCE OF A TOO RICHLY ENDOWED NATURE, THAT THE STORM WOULD SUBSIDE AND THAT THIS WAS ONLY LIKE THE YOUTH OF PRINCE HARRY, WHO CAROUSED WITH FALSTAFF, POINS, AND MRS. QUICKLY, AS DESCRIBED BY SHAKESPEARE.

THIS TIME VARVARA PETROVNA DID NOT CRY OUT, ‚ÄÚNONSENSE, NONSENSE!‚ÄÙ AS SHE WAS VERY APT TO DO IN LATER YEARS IN RESPONSE TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. ON THE CONTRARY SHE LISTENED VERY EAGERLY, ASKED HIM TO EXPLAIN THIS THEORY MORE EXACTLY, TOOK UP SHAKESPEARE HERSELF AND WITH GREAT ATTENTION READ THE IMMORTAL CHRONICLE. BUT IT DID NOT COMFORT HER, AND INDEED SHE DID NOT FIND THE RESEMBLANCE VERY STRIKING. WITH FEVERISH IMPATIENCE SHE AWAITED ANSWERS TO SOME OF HER LETTERS. SHE HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT FOR THEM. THE FATAL NEWS SOON REACHED HER THAT ‚ÄÚPRINCE HARRY‚ÄÙ HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN TWO DUELS ALMOST AT ONCE, WAS ENTIRELY TO BLAME FOR BOTH OF THEM, HAD KILLED ONE OF HIS ADVERSARIES ON THE SPOT AND HAD MAIMED THE OTHER AND WAS AWAITING HIS TRIAL IN CONSEQUENCE. THE CASE ENDED IN HIS BEING DEGRADED TO THE RANKS, DEPRIVED OF THE RIGHTS OF A NOBLEMAN, AND TRANSFERRED TO AN INFANTRY LINE REGIMENT, AND HE ONLY ESCAPED WORSE PUNISHMENT BY SPECIAL FAVOUR.

IN 1863 HE SOMEHOW SUCCEEDED IN DISTINGUISHING HIMSELF; HE RECEIVED A CROSS, WAS PROMOTED TO BE A NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER, AND ROSE RAPIDLY TO THE RANK OF AN OFFICER. DURING THIS PERIOD VARVARA PETROVNA DESPATCHED PERHAPS HUNDREDS OF LETTERS TO THE CAPITAL, FULL OF PRAYERS AND SUPPLICATIONS. SHE EVEN STOOPED TO SOME HUMILIATION IN THIS EXTREMITY. AFTER HIS PROMOTION THE YOUNG MAN SUDDENLY RESIGNED HIS COMMISSION, BUT HE DID NOT COME BACK TO SKVORESHNIKI AGAIN, AND GAVE UP WRITING TO HIS MOTHER ALTOGETHER. THEY LEARNED BY ROUNDABOUT MEANS THAT HE WAS BACK IN PETERSBURG, BUT THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE MET IN THE SAME SOCIETY AS BEFORE; HE SEEMED TO BE IN HIDING. THEY FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS LIVING IN STRANGE COMPANY, ASSOCIATING WITH THE DREGS OF THE POPULATION OF PETERSBURG, WITH SLIP-SHOD GOVERNMENT CLERKS, DISCHARGED MILITARY MEN, BEGGARS OF THE HIGHER CLASS, AND DRUNKARDS OF ALL SORTS‚ÄÎTHAT HE VISITED THEIR FILTHY FAMILIES, SPENT DAYS AND NIGHTS IN DARK SLUMS AND ALL SORTS OF LOW HAUNTS, THAT HE HAD SUNK VERY LOW, THAT HE WAS IN RAGS, AND THAT APPARENTLY HE LIKED IT. HE DID NOT ASK HIS MOTHER FOR MONEY, HE HAD HIS OWN LITTLE ESTATE‚ÄÎONCE THE PROPERTY OF HIS FATHER, GENERAL STAVROGIN, WHICH YIELDED AT LEAST SOME REVENUE, AND WHICH, IT WAS REPORTED, HE HAD LET TO A GERMAN FROM SAXONY. AT LAST HIS MOTHER BESOUGHT HIM TO COME TO HER, AND ‚ÄÚPRINCE HARRY‚ÄÙ MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN OUR TOWN. I HAD NEVER SET EYES ON HIM BEFORE, BUT NOW I GOT A VERY DISTINCT IMPRESSION OF HIM. HE WAS A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN OF FIVE-AND-TWENTY, AND I MUST OWN I WAS IMPRESSED BY HIM. I HAD EXPECTED TO SEE A DIRTY RAGAMUFFIN, SODDEN WITH DRINK AND DEBAUCHERY. HE WAS ON THE CONTRARY, THE MOST ELEGANT GENTLEMAN I HAD EVER MET, EXTREMELY WELL DRESSED, WITH AN AIR AND MANNER ONLY TO BE FOUND IN A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO CULTURE AND REFINEMENT. I WAS NOT THE ONLY PERSON SURPRISED. IT WAS A SURPRISE TO ALL THE TOWNSPEOPLE TO WHOM, OF COURSE, YOUNG STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS WHOLE BIOGRAPHY WAS WELL KNOWN IN ITS MINUTEST DETAILS, THOUGH ONE COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW THEY HAD GOT HOLD OF THEM, AND, WHAT WAS STILL MORE SURPRISING, HALF OF THEIR STORIES ABOUT HIM TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE.

ALL OUR LADIES WERE WILD OVER THE NEW VISITOR. THEY WERE SHARPLY DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTIES, ONE OF WHICH ADORED HIM WHILE THE OTHER HALF REGARDED HIM WITH A HATRED THAT WAS ALMOST BLOOD-THIRSTY: BUT BOTH WERE CRAZY ABOUT HIM. SOME OF THEM WERE PARTICULARLY FASCINATED BY THE IDEA THAT HE HAD PERHAPS A FATEFUL SECRET HIDDEN IN HIS SOUL; OTHERS WERE POSITIVELY DELIGHTED AT THE FACT THAT HE WAS A MURDERER. IT APPEARED TOO THAT HE HAD HAD A VERY GOOD EDUCATION AND WAS INDEED A MAN OF CONSIDERABLE CULTURE. NO GREAT ACQUIREMENTS WERE NEEDED, OF COURSE, TO ASTONISH US. BUT HE COULD JUDGE ALSO OF VERY INTERESTING EVERYDAY AFFAIRS, AND, WHAT WAS OF THE UTMOST VALUE, HE JUDGED OF THEM WITH REMARKABLE GOOD SENSE. I MUST MENTION AS A PECULIAR FACT THAT ALMOST FROM THE FIRST DAY WE ALL OF US THOUGHT HIM A VERY SENSIBLE FELLOW. HE WAS NOT VERY TALKATIVE, HE WAS ELEGANT WITHOUT EXAGGERATION, SURPRISINGLY MODEST, AND AT THE SAME TIME BOLD AND SELF-RELIANT, AS NONE OF US WERE. OUR DANDIES GAZED AT HIM WITH ENVY, AND WERE COMPLETELY ECLIPSED BY HIM. HIS FACE, TOO, IMPRESSED ME. HIS HAIR WAS OF A PECULIARLY INTENSE BLACK, HIS LIGHT-COLOURED EYES WERE PECULIARLY LIGHT AND CALM, HIS COMPLEXION WAS PECULIARLY SOFT AND WHITE, THE RED IN HIS CHEEKS WAS TOO BRIGHT AND CLEAR, HIS TEETH WERE LIKE PEARLS, AND HIS LIPS LIKE CORAL‚ÄÎONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE MUST BE A PARAGON OF BEAUTY, YET AT THE SAME TIME THERE SEEMED SOMETHING REPELLENT ABOUT HIM. IT WAS SAID THAT HIS FACE SUGGESTED A MASK; SO MUCH WAS SAID THOUGH, AMONG OTHER THINGS THEY TALKED OF HIS EXTRAORDINARY PHYSICAL STRENGTH. HE WAS RATHER TALL. VARVARA PETROVNA LOOKED AT HIM WITH PRIDE, YET WITH CONTINUAL UNEASINESS. HE SPENT ABOUT SIX MONTHS AMONG US‚ÄÎLISTLESS, QUIET, RATHER MOROSE. HE MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN SOCIETY, AND WITH UNFAILING PROPRIETY PERFORMED ALL THE DUTIES DEMANDED BY OUR PROVINCIAL ETIQUETTE. HE WAS RELATED, ON HIS FATHER‚ÄÔS SIDE, TO THE GOVERNOR, AND WAS RECEIVED BY THE LATTER AS A NEAR KINSMAN. BUT A FEW MONTHS PASSED AND THE WILD BEAST SHOWED HIS CLAWS.

I MAY OBSERVE BY THE WAY, IN PARENTHESIS, THAT IVAN OSSIPOVITCH, OUR DEAR MILD GOVERNOR, WAS RATHER LIKE AN OLD WOMAN, THOUGH HE WAS OF GOOD FAMILY AND HIGHLY CONNECTED‚ÄÎWHICH EXPLAINS THE FACT THAT HE REMAINED SO LONG AMONG US, THOUGH HE STEADILY AVOIDED ALL THE DUTIES OF HIS OFFICE. FROM HIS MUNIFICENCE AND HOSPITALITY HE OUGHT RATHER TO HAVE BEEN A MARSHAL OF NOBILITY OF THE GOOD OLD DAYS THAN A GOVERNOR IN SUCH BUSY TIMES AS OURS. IT WAS ALWAYS SAID IN THE TOWN THAT IT WAS NOT HE, BUT VARVARA PETROVNA WHO GOVERNED THE PROVINCE. OF COURSE THIS WAS SAID SARCASTICALLY; HOWEVER, IT WAS CERTAINLY A FALSEHOOD. AND, INDEED, MUCH WIT WAS WASTED ON THE SUBJECT AMONG US. ON THE CONTRARY, IN LATER YEARS, VARVARA PETROVNA PURPOSELY AND CONSCIOUSLY WITHDREW FROM ANYTHING LIKE A POSITION OF AUTHORITY, AND, IN SPITE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY RESPECT IN WHICH SHE WAS HELD BY THE WHOLE PROVINCE, VOLUNTARILY CONFINED HER INFLUENCE WITHIN STRICT LIMITS SET UP BY HERSELF. INSTEAD OF THESE HIGHER RESPONSIBILITIES SHE SUDDENLY TOOK UP THE MANAGEMENT OF HER ESTATE, AND, WITHIN TWO OR THREE YEARS, RAISED THE REVENUE FROM IT ALMOST TO WHAT IT HAD YIELDED IN THE PAST. GIVING UP HER FORMER ROMANTIC IMPULSES (TRIPS TO PETERSBURG, PLANS FOR FOUNDING A MAGAZINE, AND SO ON) SHE BEGAN TO BE CAREFUL AND TO SAVE MONEY. SHE KEPT EVEN STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH AT A DISTANCE, ALLOWING HIM TO TAKE LODGINGS IN ANOTHER HOUSE (A CHANGE FOR WHICH HE HAD LONG BEEN WORRYING HER UNDER VARIOUS PRETEXTS). LITTLE BY LITTLE STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH BEGAN TO CALL HER A PROSAIC WOMAN, OR MORE JESTINGLY, ‚ÄÚMY PROSAIC FRIEND.‚ÄÙ I NEED HARDLY SAY HE ONLY VENTURED ON SUCH JESTS IN AN EXTREMELY RESPECTFUL FORM, AND ON RARE, AND CAREFULLY CHOSEN, OCCASIONS.

ALL OF US IN HER INTIMATE CIRCLE FELT‚ÄÎSTEPAN TROFIMOVITCH MORE ACUTELY THAN ANY OF US‚ÄÎTHAT HER SON HAD COME TO HER ALMOST, AS IT WERE, AS A NEW HOPE, AND EVEN AS A SORT OF NEW ASPIRATION. HER PASSION FOR HER SON DATED FROM THE TIME OF HIS SUCCESSES IN PETERSBURG SOCIETY, AND GREW MORE INTENSE FROM THE MOMENT THAT HE WAS DEGRADED IN THE ARMY. YET SHE WAS EVIDENTLY AFRAID OF HIM, AND SEEMED LIKE A SLAVE IN HIS PRESENCE. IT COULD BE SEEN THAT SHE WAS AFRAID OF SOMETHING VAGUE AND MYSTERIOUS WHICH SHE COULD NOT HAVE PUT INTO WORDS, AND SHE OFTEN STOLE SEARCHING GLANCES AT ‚ÄÚNICOLAS,‚ÄÙ SCRUTINISING HIM REFLECTIVELY ‚Ä¶ AND BEHOLD‚ÄÎTHE WILD BEAST SUDDENLY SHOWED HIS CLAWS.

SUDDENLY, APROPOS OF NOTHING, OUR PRINCE WAS GUILTY OF INCREDIBLE OUTRAGES UPON VARIOUS PERSONS AND, WHAT WAS MOST STRIKING THESE OUTRAGES WERE UTTERLY UNHEARD OF, QUITE INCONCEIVABLE, UNLIKE ANYTHING COMMONLY DONE, UTTERLY SILLY AND MISCHIEVOUS, QUITE UNPROVOKED AND OBJECTLESS. ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED OF OUR CLUB MEMBERS, ON OUR COMMITTEE OF MANAGEMENT, PYOTR PAVLOVITCH GAGANOV, AN ELDERLY MAN OF HIGH RANK IN THE SERVICE, HAD FORMED THE INNOCENT HABIT OF DECLARING VEHEMENTLY ON ALL SORTS OF OCCASIONS: ‚ÄÚNO, YOU CAN‚ÄÔT LEAD ME BY THE NOSE!‚ÄÙ WELL, THERE IS NO HARM IN THAT. BUT ONE DAY AT THE CLUB, WHEN HE BROUGHT OUT THIS PHRASE IN CONNECTION WITH SOME HEATED DISCUSSION IN THE MIDST OF A LITTLE GROUP OF MEMBERS (ALL PERSONS OF SOME CONSEQUENCE) NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, WHO WAS STANDING ON ONE SIDE, ALONE AND UNNOTICED, SUDDENLY WENT UP TO PYOTR PAVLOVITCH, TOOK HIM UNEXPECTEDLY AND FIRMLY WITH TWO FINGERS BY THE NOSE, AND SUCCEEDED IN LEADING HIM TWO OR THREE STEPS ACROSS THE ROOM. HE COULD HAVE HAD NO GRUDGE AGAINST MR. GAGANOV. IT MIGHT BE THOUGHT TO BE A MERE SCHOOLBOY PRANK, THOUGH, OF COURSE, A MOST UNPARDONABLE ONE. YET, DESCRIBING IT AFTERWARDS, PEOPLE SAID THAT HE LOOKED ALMOST DREAMY AT THE VERY INSTANT OF THE OPERATION, ‚ÄÚAS THOUGH HE HAD GONE OUT OF HIS MIND,‚ÄÙ BUT THAT WAS RECALLED AND REFLECTED UPON LONG AFTERWARDS. IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE MOMENT ALL THEY RECALLED WAS THE MINUTE AFTER, WHEN HE CERTAINLY SAW IT ALL AS IT REALLY WAS, AND FAR FROM BEING CONFUSED SMILED GAILY AND MALICIOUSLY ‚ÄÚWITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST REGRET.‚ÄÙ THERE WAS A TERRIFIC OUTCRY; HE WAS SURROUNDED. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH KEPT TURNING ROUND, LOOKING ABOUT HIM, ANSWERING NOBODY, AND GLANCING CURIOUSLY AT THE PERSONS EXCLAIMING AROUND HIM. AT LAST HE SEEMED SUDDENLY, AS IT WERE, TO SINK INTO THOUGHT AGAIN‚ÄÎSO AT LEAST IT WAS REPORTED‚ÄÎFROWNED, WENT FIRMLY UP TO THE AFFRONTED PYOTR PAVLOVITCH, AND WITH EVIDENT VEXATION SAID IN A RAPID MUTTER:

‚ÄÚYOU MUST FORGIVE ME, OF COURSE ‚Ä¶ I REALLY DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT SUDDENLY CAME OVER ME ‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS SILLY.‚ÄÙ

THE CARELESSNESS OF HIS APOLOGY WAS ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO A FRESH INSULT. THE OUTCRY WAS GREATER THAN EVER. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND WENT AWAY. ALL THIS WAS VERY STUPID, TO SAY NOTHING OF ITS GROSS INDECENCY‚ÄÎ

A CALCULATED AND PREMEDITATED INDECENCY AS IT SEEMED AT FIRST SIGHT‚ÄÎAND THEREFORE A PREMEDITATED AND UTTERLY BRUTAL INSULT TO OUR WHOLE SOCIETY. SO IT WAS TAKEN TO BE BY EVERY ONE. WE BEGAN BY PROMPTLY AND UNANIMOUSLY STRIKING YOUNG STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS NAME OFF THE LIST OF CLUB MEMBERS. THEN IT WAS DECIDED TO SEND AN APPEAL IN THE NAME OF THE WHOLE CLUB TO THE GOVERNOR, BEGGING HIM AT ONCE (WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE CASE TO BE FORMALLY TRIED IN COURT) TO USE ‚ÄÚTHE ADMINISTRATIVE POWER ENTRUSTED TO HIM‚ÄÙ TO RESTRAIN THIS DANGEROUS RUFFIAN, ‚ÄÚTHIS DUELLING BULLY FROM THE CAPITAL, AND SO PROTECT THE TRANQUILLITY OF ALL THE GENTRY OF OUR TOWN FROM INJURIOUS ENCROACHMENTS.‚ÄÙ IT WAS ADDED WITH ANGRY RESENTMENT THAT ‚ÄÚA LAW MIGHT BE FOUND TO CONTROL EVEN MR. STAVROGIN.‚ÄÙ THIS PHRASE WAS PREPARED BY WAY OF A THRUST AT THE GOVERNOR ON ACCOUNT OF VARVARA PETROVNA. THEY ELABORATED IT WITH RELISH. AS ILL LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, THE GOVERNOR WAS NOT IN THE TOWN AT THE TIME. HE HAD GONE TO A LITTLE DISTANCE TO STAND GODFATHER TO THE CHILD OF A VERY CHARMING LADY, RECENTLY LEFT A WIDOW IN AN INTERESTING CONDITION. BUT IT WAS KNOWN THAT HE WOULD SOON BE BACK. IN THE MEANWHILE THEY GOT UP A REGULAR OVATION FOR THE RESPECTED AND INSULTED GENTLEMAN; PEOPLE EMBRACED AND KISSED HIM; THE WHOLE TOWN CALLED UPON HIM. IT WAS EVEN PROPOSED TO GIVE A SUBSCRIPTION DINNER IN HIS HONOUR, AND THEY ONLY GAVE UP THE IDEA AT HIS EARNEST REQUEST‚ÄÎREFLECTING POSSIBLY AT LAST THAT THE MAN HAD, AFTER ALL, BEEN PULLED BY THE NOSE AND THAT THAT WAS REALLY NOTHING TO CONGRATULATE HIM UPON. YET, HOW HAD IT HAPPENED? HOW COULD IT HAVE HAPPENED? IT IS REMARKABLE THAT NO ONE IN THE WHOLE TOWN PUT DOWN THIS SAVAGE ACT TO MADNESS. THEY MUST HAVE BEEN PREDISPOSED TO EXPECT SUCH ACTIONS FROM NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, EVEN WHEN HE WAS SANE. FOR MY PART I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW TO THIS DAY HOW TO EXPLAIN IT, IN SPITE OF THE EVENT THAT QUICKLY FOLLOWED AND APPARENTLY EXPLAINED EVERYTHING, AND CONCILIATED EVERY ONE. I WILL ADD ALSO THAT, FOUR YEARS LATER, IN REPLY TO A DISCREET QUESTION FROM ME ABOUT THE INCIDENT AT THE CLUB, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH ANSWERED, FROWNING: ‚ÄÚI WASN‚ÄÔT QUITE WELL AT THE TIME.‚ÄÙ BUT THERE IS NO NEED TO ANTICIPATE EVENTS.

THE GENERAL OUTBURST OF HATRED WITH WHICH EVERY ONE FELL UPON THE ‚ÄÚRUFFIAN AND DUELLING BULLY FROM THE CAPITAL‚ÄÙ ALSO STRUCK ME AS CURIOUS. THEY INSISTED ON SEEING AN INSOLENT DESIGN AND DELIBERATE INTENTION TO INSULT OUR WHOLE SOCIETY AT ONCE. THE TRUTH WAS NO ONE LIKED THE FELLOW, BUT, ON THE CONTRARY, HE HAD SET EVERY ONE AGAINST HIM‚ÄÎAND ONE WONDERS HOW. UP TO THE LAST INCIDENT HE HAD NEVER QUARRELLED WITH ANYONE, NOR INSULTED ANYONE, BUT WAS AS COURTEOUS AS A GENTLEMAN IN A FASHION-PLATE, IF ONLY THE LATTER WERE ABLE TO SPEAK. I IMAGINE THAT HE WAS HATED FOR HIS PRIDE. EVEN OUR LADIES, WHO HAD BEGUN BY ADORING HIM, RAILED AGAINST HIM NOW, MORE LOUDLY THAN THE MEN. VARVARA PETROVNA WAS DREADFULLY OVERWHELMED. SHE CONFESSED AFTERWARDS TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH THAT SHE HAD HAD A FOREBODING OF ALL THIS LONG BEFORE, THAT EVERY DAY FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS SHE HAD BEEN EXPECTING ‚ÄÚJUST SOMETHING OF THAT SORT,‚ÄÙ A REMARKABLE ADMISSION ON THE PART OF HIS OWN MOTHER. ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS BEGUN!‚ÄÙ SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF WITH A SHUDDER. THE MORNING AFTER THE INCIDENT AT THE CLUB SHE CAUTIOUSLY BUT FIRMLY APPROACHED THE SUBJECT WITH HER SON, BUT THE POOR WOMAN WAS TREMBLING ALL OVER IN SPITE OF HER FIRMNESS. SHE HAD NOT SLEPT ALL NIGHT AND EVEN WENT OUT EARLY TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS LODGINGS TO ASK HIS ADVICE, AND SHED TEARS THERE, A THING WHICH SHE HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO DO BEFORE ANYONE. SHE LONGED FOR ‚ÄÚNICOLAS‚ÄÙ TO SAY SOMETHING TO HER, TO DEIGN TO GIVE SOME EXPLANATION. NIKOLAY, WHO WAS ALWAYS SO POLITE AND RESPECTFUL TO HIS MOTHER, LISTENED TO HER FOR SOME TIME SCOWLING, BUT VERY SERIOUSLY. HE SUDDENLY GOT UP WITHOUT SAYING A WORD, KISSED HER HAND AND WENT AWAY. THAT VERY EVENING, AS THOUGH BY DESIGN, HE PERPETRATED ANOTHER SCANDAL. IT WAS OF A MORE HARMLESS AND ORDINARY CHARACTER THAN THE FIRST. YET, OWING TO THE STATE OF THE PUBLIC MIND, IT INCREASED THE OUTCRY IN THE TOWN.

OUR FRIEND LIPUTIN TURNED UP AND CALLED ON NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE LATTER‚ÄÔS INTERVIEW WITH HIS MOTHER, AND EARNESTLY BEGGED FOR THE HONOUR OF HIS COMPANY AT A LITTLE PARTY HE WAS GIVING FOR HIS WIFE‚ÄÔS BIRTHDAY THAT EVENING. VARVARA PETROVNA HAD LONG WATCHED WITH A PANG AT HER HEART HER SON‚ÄÔS TASTE FOR SUCH LOW COMPANY, BUT SHE HAD NOT DARED TO SPEAK OF IT TO HIM. HE HAD MADE SEVERAL ACQUAINTANCES BESIDES LIPUTIN IN THE THIRD RANK OF OUR SOCIETY, AND EVEN IN LOWER DEPTHS‚ÄÎHE HAD A PROPENSITY FOR MAKING SUCH FRIENDS. HE HAD NEVER BEEN IN LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS HOUSE BEFORE, THOUGH HE HAD MET THE MAN HIMSELF. HE GUESSED THAT LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS INVITATION NOW WAS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE PREVIOUS DAY‚ÄÔS SCANDAL, AND THAT AS A LOCAL LIBERAL HE WAS DELIGHTED AT THE SCANDAL, GENUINELY BELIEVING THAT THAT WAS THE PROPER WAY TO TREAT STEWARDS AT THE CLUB, AND THAT IT WAS VERY WELL DONE. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SMILED AND PROMISED TO COME.

A GREAT NUMBER OF GUESTS HAD ASSEMBLED. THE COMPANY WAS NOT VERY PRESENTABLE, BUT VERY SPRIGHTLY. LIPUTIN, VAIN AND ENVIOUS, ONLY ENTERTAINED VISITORS TWICE A YEAR, BUT ON THOSE OCCASIONS HE DID IT WITHOUT STINT. THE MOST HONOURED OF THE INVITED GUESTS, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, WAS PREVENTED BY ILLNESS FROM BEING PRESENT. TEA WAS HANDED, AND THERE WERE REFRESHMENTS AND VODKA IN PLENTY. CARDS WERE PLAYED AT THREE TABLES, AND WHILE WAITING FOR SUPPER THE YOUNG PEOPLE GOT UP A DANCE. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH LED OUT MADAME LIPUTIN‚ÄÎA VERY PRETTY LITTLE WOMAN WHO WAS DREADFULLY SHY OF HIM‚ÄÎTOOK TWO TURNS ROUND THE ROOM WITH HER, SAT DOWN BESIDE HER, DREW HER INTO CONVERSATION AND MADE HER LAUGH. NOTICING AT LAST HOW PRETTY SHE WAS WHEN SHE LAUGHED, HE SUDDENLY, BEFORE ALL THE COMPANY, SEIZED HER ROUND THE WAIST AND KISSED HER ON THE LIPS TWO OR THREE TIMES WITH GREAT RELISH. THE POOR FRIGHTENED LADY FAINTED. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH TOOK HIS HAT AND WENT UP TO THE HUSBAND, WHO STOOD PETRIFIED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GENERAL EXCITEMENT. LOOKING AT HIM HE, TOO, BECAME CONFUSED AND MUTTERING HURRIEDLY ‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT BE ANGRY,‚ÄÙ WENT AWAY. LIPUTIN RAN AFTER HIM IN THE ENTRY, GAVE HIM HIS FUR-COAT WITH HIS OWN HANDS, AND SAW HIM DOWN THE STAIRS, BOWING. BUT NEXT DAY A RATHER AMUSING SEQUEL FOLLOWED THIS COMPARATIVELY HARMLESS PRANK‚ÄÎA SEQUEL FROM WHICH LIPUTIN GAINED SOME CREDIT, AND OF WHICH HE TOOK THE FULLEST POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE.

AT TEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE MORNING LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS SERVANT AGAFYA, AN EASY-MANNERED, LIVELY, ROSY-CHEEKED PEASANT WOMAN OF THIRTY, MADE HER APPEARANCE AT STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS HOUSE, WITH A MESSAGE FOR NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH. SHE INSISTED ON SEEING ‚ÄÚHIS HONOUR HIMSELF.‚ÄÙ HE HAD A VERY BAD HEADACHE, BUT HE WENT OUT. VARVARA PETROVNA SUCCEEDED IN BEING PRESENT WHEN THE MESSAGE WAS GIVEN.

‚ÄÚSERGAY VASSILYEVITCH‚ÄÙ (LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS NAME), AGAFYA RATTLED OFF BRISKLY, ‚ÄÚBADE ME FIRST OF ALL GIVE YOU HIS RESPECTFUL GREETINGS AND ASK AFTER YOUR HEALTH, WHAT SORT OF NIGHT YOUR HONOUR SPENT AFTER YESTERDAY‚ÄÔS DOINGS, AND HOW YOUR HONOUR FEELS NOW AFTER YESTERDAY‚ÄÔS DOINGS?‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SMILED.

‚ÄÚGIVE HIM MY GREETINGS AND THANK HIM, AND TELL YOUR MASTER FROM ME, AGAFYA, THAT HE‚ÄÔS THE MOST SENSIBLE MAN IN THE TOWN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND HE TOLD ME TO ANSWER THAT,‚ÄÙ AGAFYA CAUGHT HIM UP STILL MORE BRISKLY, ‚ÄÚTHAT HE KNOWS THAT WITHOUT YOUR TELLING HIM, AND WISHES YOU THE SAME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚREALLY! BUT HOW COULD HE TELL WHAT I SHOULD SAY TO YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI CAN‚ÄÔT SAY IN WHAT WAY HE COULD TELL, BUT WHEN I HAD SET OFF AND HAD GONE RIGHT DOWN THE STREET, I HEARD SOMETHING, AND THERE HE WAS, RUNNING AFTER ME WITHOUT HIS CAP. ‚ÄÒI SAY, AGAFYA, IF BY ANY CHANCE HE SAYS TO YOU, ‚ÄÚTELL YOUR MASTER THAT HE HAS MORE SENSE THAN ALL THE TOWN,‚ÄÙ YOU TELL HIM AT ONCE, DON‚ÄÔT FORGET, ‚ÄÚTHE MASTER HIMSELF KNOWS THAT VERY WELL, AND WISHES YOU THE SAME.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

AT LAST THE INTERVIEW WITH THE GOVERNOR TOOK PLACE TOO. OUR DEAR, MILD, IVAN OSSIPOVITCH HAD ONLY JUST RETURNED AND ONLY JUST HAD TIME TO HEAR THE ANGRY COMPLAINT FROM THE CLUB. THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE, BUT HE WAS TROUBLED. THE HOSPITABLE OLD MAN SEEMED ALSO RATHER AFRAID OF HIS YOUNG KINSMAN. HE MADE UP HIS MIND, HOWEVER, TO INDUCE HIM TO APOLOGISE TO THE CLUB AND TO HIS VICTIM IN SATISFACTORY FORM, AND, IF REQUIRED, BY LETTER, AND THEN TO PERSUADE HIM TO LEAVE US FOR A TIME, TRAVELLING, FOR INSTANCE, TO IMPROVE HIS MIND, IN ITALY, OR IN FACT ANYWHERE ABROAD. IN THE WAITING-ROOM IN WHICH ON THIS OCCASION HE RECEIVED NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH (WHO HAD BEEN AT OTHER TIMES PRIVILEGED AS A RELATION TO WANDER ALL OVER THE HOUSE UNCHECKED), ALYOSHA TELYATNIKOV, A CLERK OF REFINED MANNERS, WHO WAS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS HOUSEHOLD, WAS SITTING IN A CORNER OPENING ENVELOPES AT A TABLE, AND IN THE NEXT ROOM, AT THE WINDOW NEAREST TO THE DOOR, A STOUT AND STURDY COLONEL, A FORMER FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE OF THE GOVERNOR, WAS SITTING ALONE READING THE GOLOS, PAYING NO ATTENTION, OF COURSE, TO WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE IN THE WAITING-ROOM; IN FACT, HE HAD HIS BACK TURNED. IVAN OSSIPOVITCH APPROACHED THE SUBJECT IN A ROUNDABOUT WAY, ALMOST IN A WHISPER, BUT KEPT GETTING A LITTLE MUDDLED. NIKOLAY LOOKED ANYTHING BUT CORDIAL, NOT AT ALL AS A RELATION SHOULD. HE WAS PALE AND SAT LOOKING DOWN AND CONTINUALLY MOVING HIS EYEBROWS AS THOUGH TRYING TO CONTROL ACUTE PAIN.

‚ÄÚYOU HAVE A KIND HEART AND A GENEROUS ONE, NICOLAS,‚ÄÙ THE OLD MAN PUT IN AMONG OTHER THINGS, ‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE A MAN OF GREAT CULTURE, YOU‚ÄÔVE GROWN UP IN THE HIGHEST CIRCLES, AND HERE TOO YOUR BEHAVIOUR HAS HITHERTO BEEN A MODEL, WHICH HAS BEEN A GREAT CONSOLATION TO YOUR MOTHER, WHO IS SO PRECIOUS TO ALL OF US.‚Ä¶ AND NOW AGAIN EVERYTHING HAS APPEARED IN SUCH AN UNACCOUNTABLE LIGHT, SO DETRIMENTAL TO ALL! I SPEAK AS A FRIEND OF YOUR FAMILY, AS AN OLD MAN WHO LOVES YOU SINCERELY AND A RELATION, AT WHOSE WORDS YOU CANNOT TAKE OFFENCE.‚Ä¶ TELL ME, WHAT DRIVES YOU TO SUCH RECKLESS PROCEEDINGS SO CONTRARY TO ALL ACCEPTED RULES AND HABITS? WHAT CAN BE THE MEANING OF SUCH ACTS WHICH SEEM ALMOST LIKE OUTBREAKS OF DELIRIUM?‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY LISTENED WITH VEXATION AND IMPATIENCE. ALL AT ONCE THERE WAS A GLEAM OF SOMETHING SLY AND MOCKING IN HIS EYES.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL TELL YOU WHAT DRIVES ME TO IT,‚ÄÙ HE SAID SULLENLY, AND LOOKING ROUND HIM HE BENT DOWN TO IVAN OSSIPOVITCH‚ÄÔS EAR. THE REFINED ALYOSHA TELYATNIKOV MOVED THREE STEPS FARTHER AWAY TOWARDS THE WINDOW, AND THE COLONEL COUGHED OVER THE GOLOS. POOR IVAN OSSIPOVITCH HURRIEDLY AND TRUSTFULLY INCLINED HIS EAR; HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY CURIOUS. AND THEN SOMETHING UTTERLY INCREDIBLE, THOUGH ON THE OTHER SIDE ONLY TOO UNMISTAKABLE, TOOK PLACE. THE OLD MAN SUDDENLY FELT THAT, INSTEAD OF TELLING HIM SOME INTERESTING SECRET, NIKOLAY HAD SEIZED THE UPPER PART OF HIS EAR BETWEEN HIS TEETH AND WAS NIPPING IT RATHER HARD. HE SHUDDERED, AND BREATH FAILED HIM.

‚ÄÚNICOLAS, THIS IS BEYOND A JOKE!‚ÄÙ HE MOANED MECHANICALLY IN A VOICE NOT HIS OWN.

ALYOSHA AND THE COLONEL HAD NOT YET GRASPED THE SITUATION, BESIDES THEY COULDN‚ÄÔT SEE, AND FANCIED UP TO THE END THAT THE TWO WERE WHISPERING TOGETHER; AND YET THE OLD MAN‚ÄÔS DESPERATE FACE ALARMED THEM. THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER WITH WIDE-OPEN EYES, NOT KNOWING WHETHER TO RUSH TO HIS ASSISTANCE AS AGREED OR TO WAIT. NIKOLAY NOTICED THIS PERHAPS, AND BIT THE HARDER.

‚ÄÚNICOLAS! NICOLAS!‚ÄÙ HIS VICTIM MOANED AGAIN, ‚ÄÚCOME ‚Ä¶ YOU‚ÄÔVE HAD YOUR JOKE, THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH!‚ÄÙ

IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE POOR GOVERNOR WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE DIED OF TERROR; BUT THE MONSTER HAD MERCY ON HIM, AND LET GO HIS EAR. THE OLD MAN‚ÄÔS DEADLY TERROR LASTED FOR A FULL MINUTE, AND IT WAS FOLLOWED BY A SORT OF FIT. WITHIN HALF AN HOUR NIKOLAY WAS ARRESTED AND REMOVED FOR THE TIME TO THE GUARD-ROOM, WHERE HE WAS CONFINED IN A SPECIAL CELL, WITH A SPECIAL SENTINEL AT THE DOOR. THIS DECISION WAS A HARSH ONE, BUT OUR MILD GOVERNOR WAS SO ANGRY THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY EVEN IF HE HAD TO FACE VARVARA PETROVNA. TO THE GENERAL AMAZEMENT, WHEN THIS LADY ARRIVED AT THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS IN HASTE AND IN NERVOUS IRRITATION TO DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH HIM AT ONCE, SHE WAS REFUSED ADMITTANCE, WHEREUPON, WITHOUT GETTING OUT OF THE CARRIAGE, SHE RETURNED HOME, UNABLE TO BELIEVE HER SENSES.

AND AT LAST EVERYTHING WAS EXPLAINED! AT TWO O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE MORNING THE PRISONER, WHO HAD TILL THEN BEEN CALM AND HAD EVEN SLEPT, SUDDENLY BECAME NOISY, BEGAN FURIOUSLY BEATING ON THE DOOR WITH HIS FISTS,‚ÄÎWITH UNNATURAL STRENGTH WRENCHED THE IRON GRATING OFF THE DOOR, BROKE THE WINDOW, AND CUT HIS HANDS ALL OVER. WHEN THE OFFICER ON DUTY RAN WITH A DETACHMENT OF MEN AND THE KEYS AND ORDERED THE CELL TO BE OPENED THAT THEY MIGHT RUSH IN AND BIND THE MANIAC, IT APPEARED THAT HE WAS SUFFERING FROM ACUTE BRAIN FEVER. HE WAS TAKEN HOME TO HIS MOTHER.

EVERYTHING WAS EXPLAINED AT ONCE. ALL OUR THREE DOCTORS GAVE IT AS THEIR OPINION THAT THE PATIENT MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN IN A DELIRIOUS STATE FOR THREE DAYS BEFORE, AND THAT THOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE APPARENTLY BEEN IN POSSESSION OF FULL CONSCIOUSNESS AND CUNNING, YET HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF COMMON SENSE AND WILL, WHICH WAS INDEED BORNE OUT BY THE FACTS. SO IT TURNED OUT THAT LIPUTIN HAD GUESSED THE TRUTH SOONER THAN ANY ONE. IVAN OSSIPOVITCH, WHO WAS A MAN OF DELICACY AND FEELING, WAS COMPLETELY ABASHED. BUT WHAT WAS STRIKING WAS THAT HE, TOO, HAD CONSIDERED NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH CAPABLE OF ANY MAD ACTION EVEN WHEN IN THE FULL POSSESSION OF HIS FACULTIES. AT THE CLUB, TOO, PEOPLE WERE ASHAMED AND WONDERED HOW IT WAS THEY HAD FAILED TO ‚ÄÚSEE THE ELEPHANT‚ÄÙ AND HAD MISSED THE ONLY EXPLANATION OF ALL THESE MARVELS: THERE WERE, OF COURSE, SCEPTICS AMONG THEM, BUT THEY COULD NOT LONG MAINTAIN THEIR POSITION.

NIKOLAY WAS IN BED FOR MORE THAN TWO MONTHS. A FAMOUS DOCTOR WAS SUMMONED FROM MOSCOW FOR A CONSULTATION; THE WHOLE TOWN CALLED ON VARVARA PETROVNA. SHE FORGAVE THEM. WHEN IN THE SPRING NIKOLAY HAD COMPLETELY RECOVERED AND ASSENTED WITHOUT DISCUSSION TO HIS MOTHER‚ÄÔS PROPOSAL THAT HE SHOULD GO FOR A TOUR TO ITALY, SHE BEGGED HIM FURTHER TO PAY VISITS OF FAREWELL TO ALL THE NEIGHBOURS, AND SO FAR AS POSSIBLE TO APOLOGISE WHERE NECESSARY. NIKOLAY AGREED WITH GREAT ALACRITY. IT BECAME KNOWN AT THE CLUB THAT HE HAD HAD A MOST DELICATE EXPLANATION WITH PYOTR PAVLOVITCH GAGANOV, AT THE HOUSE OF THE LATTER, WHO HAD BEEN COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH HIS APOLOGY. AS HE WENT ROUND TO PAY THESE CALLS NIKOLAY WAS VERY GRAVE AND EVEN GLOOMY. EVERY ONE APPEARED TO RECEIVE HIM SYMPATHETICALLY, BUT EVERYBODY SEEMED EMBARRASSED AND GLAD THAT HE WAS GOING TO ITALY. IVAN OSSIPOVITCH WAS POSITIVELY TEARFUL, BUT WAS, FOR SOME REASON, UNABLE TO BRING HIMSELF TO EMBRACE HIM, EVEN AT THE FINAL LEAVE-TAKING. IT IS TRUE THAT SOME OF US RETAINED THE CONVICTION THAT THE SCAMP HAD SIMPLY BEEN MAKING FUN OF US, AND THAT THE ILLNESS WAS NEITHER HERE NOR THERE. HE WENT TO SEE LIPUTIN TOO.

‚ÄÚTELL ME,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, ‚ÄÚHOW COULD YOU GUESS BEFOREHAND WHAT I SHOULD SAY ABOUT YOUR SENSE AND PRIME AGAFYA WITH AN ANSWER TO IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY,‚ÄÙ LAUGHED LIPUTIN, ‚ÄÚIT WAS BECAUSE I RECOGNISED THAT YOU WERE A CLEVER MAN, AND SO I FORESAW WHAT YOUR ANSWER WOULD BE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚANYWAY, IT WAS A REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE. BUT, EXCUSE ME, DID YOU CONSIDER ME A SENSIBLE MAN AND NOT INSANE WHEN YOU SENT AGAFYA?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFOR THE CLEVEREST AND MOST RATIONAL, AND I ONLY PRETENDED TO BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE INSANE.‚Ä¶ AND YOU GUESSED AT ONCE WHAT WAS IN MY MIND, AND SENT A TESTIMONIAL TO MY WIT THROUGH AGAFYA.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, THERE YOU‚ÄÔRE A LITTLE MISTAKEN. I REALLY WAS ‚Ä¶ UNWELL ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ MUTTERED NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, FROWNING. ‚ÄÚBAH!‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, ‚ÄÚDO YOU SUPPOSE I‚ÄÔM CAPABLE OF ATTACKING PEOPLE WHEN I‚ÄÔM IN MY SENSES? WHAT OBJECT WOULD THERE BE IN IT?‚ÄÙ

LIPUTIN SHRANK TOGETHER AND DIDN‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT TO ANSWER. NIKOLAY TURNED PALE OR, AT LEAST, SO IT SEEMED TO LIPUTIN.

‚ÄÚYOU HAVE A VERY PECULIAR WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS, ANYHOW,‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY WENT ON, ‚ÄÚBUT AS FOR AGAFYA, I UNDERSTAND, OF COURSE, THAT YOU SIMPLY SENT HER TO BE RUDE TO ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI COULDN‚ÄÔT CHALLENGE YOU TO A DUEL, COULD I?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, NO, OF COURSE! I SEEM TO HAVE HEARD THAT YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT FOND OF DUELS.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY BORROW FROM THE FRENCH?‚ÄÙ SAID LIPUTIN, DOUBLING UP AGAIN.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE FOR NATIONALISM, THEN?‚ÄÙ

LIPUTIN SHRANK INTO HIMSELF MORE THAN EVER.

‚ÄÚBAH, BAH! WHAT DO I SEE?‚ÄÙ CRIED NICOLAS, NOTICING A VOLUME OF CONSID√©RANT IN THE MOST CONSPICUOUS PLACE ON THE TABLE. ‚ÄÚYOU DON‚ÄÔT MEAN TO SAY YOU‚ÄÔRE A FOURIERIST! I‚ÄÔM AFRAID YOU MUST BE! AND ISN‚ÄÔT THIS TOO BORROWING FROM THE FRENCH?‚ÄÙ HE LAUGHED, TAPPING THE BOOK WITH HIS FINGER.

‚ÄÚNO, THAT‚ÄÔS NOT TAKEN FROM THE FRENCH,‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN CRIED WITH POSITIVE FURY, JUMPING UP FROM HIS CHAIR. ‚ÄÚTHAT IS TAKEN FROM THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE OF HUMANITY, NOT SIMPLY FROM THE FRENCH. FROM THE LANGUAGE OF THE UNIVERSAL SOCIAL REPUBLIC AND HARMONY OF MANKIND, LET ME TELL YOU! NOT SIMPLY FROM THE FRENCH!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFOO! HANG IT ALL! THERE‚ÄÔS NO SUCH LANGUAGE!‚ÄÙ LAUGHED NIKOLAY.

SOMETIMES A TRIFLE WILL CATCH THE ATTENTION AND EXCLUSIVELY ABSORB IT FOR A TIME. MOST OF WHAT I HAVE TO TELL OF YOUNG STAVROGIN WILL COME LATER. BUT I WILL NOTE NOW AS A CURIOUS FACT THAT OF ALL THE IMPRESSIONS MADE ON HIM BY HIS STAY IN OUR TOWN, THE ONE MOST SHARPLY IMPRINTED ON HIS MEMORY WAS THE UNSIGHTLY AND ALMOST ABJECT FIGURE OF THE LITTLE PROVINCIAL OFFICIAL, THE COARSE AND JEALOUS FAMILY DESPOT, THE MISERLY MONEY-LENDER WHO PICKED UP THE CANDLE-ENDS AND SCRAPS LEFT FROM DINNER, AND WAS AT THE SAME TIME A PASSIONATE BELIEVER IN SOME VISIONARY FUTURE ‚ÄÚSOCIAL HARMONY,‚ÄÙ WHO AT NIGHT GLOATED IN ECSTASIES OVER FANTASTIC PICTURES OF A FUTURE PHALANSTERY, IN THE APPROACHING REALISATION OF WHICH, IN RUSSIA, AND IN OUR PROVINCE, HE BELIEVED AS FIRMLY AS IN HIS OWN EXISTENCE. AND THAT IN THE VERY PLACE WHERE HE HAD SAVED UP TO BUY HIMSELF A ‚ÄÚLITTLE HOME,‚ÄÙ WHERE HE HAD MARRIED FOR THE SECOND TIME, GETTING A DOWRY WITH HIS BRIDE, WHERE PERHAPS, FOR A HUNDRED MILES ROUND THERE WAS NOT ONE MAN, HIMSELF INCLUDED, WHO WAS THE VERY LEAST LIKE A FUTURE MEMBER ‚ÄÚOF THE UNIVERSAL HUMAN REPUBLIC AND SOCIAL HARMONY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGOD KNOWS HOW THESE PEOPLE COME TO EXIST!‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY WONDERED, RECALLING SOMETIMES THE UNLOOKED-FOR FOURIERIST.

IV

OUR PRINCE TRAVELLED FOR OVER THREE YEARS, SO THAT HE WAS ALMOST FORGOTTEN IN THE TOWN. WE LEARNED FROM STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH THAT HE HAD TRAVELLED ALL OVER EUROPE, THAT HE HAD EVEN BEEN IN EGYPT AND HAD VISITED JERUSALEM, AND THEN HAD JOINED SOME SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION TO ICELAND, AND HE ACTUALLY DID GO TO ICELAND. IT WAS REPORTED TOO THAT HE HAD SPENT ONE WINTER ATTENDING LECTURES IN A GERMAN UNIVERSITY. HE DID NOT WRITE OFTEN TO HIS MOTHER, TWICE A YEAR, OR EVEN LESS, BUT VARVARA PETROVNA WAS NOT ANGRY OR OFFENDED AT THIS. SHE ACCEPTED SUBMISSIVELY AND WITHOUT REPINING THE RELATIONS THAT HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED ONCE FOR ALL BETWEEN HER SON AND HERSELF. SHE FRETTED FOR HER ‚ÄÚNICOLAS‚ÄÙ AND DREAMED OF HIM CONTINUALLY. SHE KEPT HER DREAMS AND LAMENTATIONS TO HERSELF. SHE SEEMED TO HAVE BECOME LESS INTIMATE EVEN WITH STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. SHE WAS FORMING SECRET PROJECTS, AND SEEMED TO HAVE BECOME MORE CAREFUL ABOUT MONEY THAN EVER. SHE WAS MORE THAN EVER GIVEN TO SAVING MONEY AND BEING ANGRY AT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS LOSSES AT CARDS.

AT LAST, IN THE APRIL OF THIS YEAR, SHE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM PARIS FROM PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA DROZDOV, THE WIDOW OF THE GENERAL AND THE FRIEND OF VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS CHILDHOOD. PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA, WHOM VARVARA PETROVNA HAD NOT SEEN OR CORRESPONDED WITH FOR EIGHT YEARS, WROTE, INFORMING HER THAT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAD BECOME VERY INTIMATE WITH THEM AND A GREAT FRIEND OF HER ONLY DAUGHTER, LIZA, AND THAT HE WAS INTENDING TO ACCOMPANY THEM TO SWITZERLAND, TO VERNEY-MONTREUX, THOUGH IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF COUNT K. (A VERY INFLUENTIAL PERSONAGE IN PETERSBURG), WHO WAS NOW STAYING IN PARIS. HE WAS RECEIVED LIKE A SON OF THE FAMILY, SO THAT HE ALMOST LIVED AT THE COUNT‚ÄÔS. THE LETTER WAS BRIEF, AND THE OBJECT OF IT WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR, THOUGH IT CONTAINED ONLY A PLAIN STATEMENT OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED FACTS WITHOUT DRAWING ANY INFERENCES FROM THEM. VARVARA PETROVNA DID NOT PAUSE LONG TO CONSIDER; SHE MADE UP HER MIND INSTANTLY, MADE HER PREPARATIONS, AND TAKING WITH HER HER PROT√©G√©E, DASHA (SHATOV‚ÄÔS SISTER), SHE SET OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF APRIL FOR PARIS, AND FROM THERE WENT ON TO SWITZERLAND. SHE RETURNED IN JULY, ALONE, LEAVING DASHA WITH THE DROZDOVS. SHE BROUGHT US THE NEWS THAT THE DROZDOVS THEMSELVES HAD PROMISED TO ARRIVE AMONG US BY THE END OF AUGUST.

THE DROZDOVS, TOO, WERE LANDOWNERS OF OUR PROVINCE, BUT THE OFFICIAL DUTIES OF GENERAL IVAN IVANOVITCH DROZDOV (WHO HAD BEEN A FRIEND OF VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS AND A COLLEAGUE OF HER HUSBAND‚ÄÔS) HAD ALWAYS PREVENTED THEM FROM VISITING THEIR MAGNIFICENT ESTATE. ON THE DEATH OF THE GENERAL, WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE THE YEAR BEFORE, THE INCONSOLABLE WIDOW HAD GONE ABROAD WITH HER DAUGHTER, PARTLY IN ORDER TO TRY THE GRAPE-CURE WHICH SHE PROPOSED TO CARRY OUT AT VERNEY-MONTREUX DURING THE LATTER HALF OF THE SUMMER. ON THEIR RETURN TO RUSSIA THEY INTENDED TO SETTLE IN OUR PROVINCE FOR GOOD. SHE HAD A LARGE HOUSE IN THE TOWN WHICH HAD STOOD EMPTY FOR MANY YEARS WITH THE WINDOWS NAILED UP. THEY WERE WEALTHY PEOPLE. PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA HAD BEEN, IN HER FIRST MARRIAGE, A MADAME TUSHIN, AND LIKE HER SCHOOL-FRIEND, VARVARA PETROVNA, WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR OF THE OLD SCHOOL, AND SHE TOO HAD BEEN AN HEIRESS AT HER MARRIAGE. TUSHIN, A RETIRED CAVALRY CAPTAIN, WAS ALSO A MAN OF MEANS, AND OF SOME ABILITY. AT HIS DEATH HE LEFT A SNUG FORTUNE TO HIS ONLY DAUGHTER LIZA, A CHILD OF SEVEN. NOW THAT LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA WAS TWENTY-TWO HER PRIVATE FORTUNE MIGHT CONFIDENTLY BE RECKONED AT 200,000 ROUBLES, TO SAY NOTHING OF THE PROPERTY‚ÄÎWHICH WAS BOUND TO COME TO HER AT THE DEATH OF HER MOTHER, WHO HAD NO CHILDREN BY HER SECOND MARRIAGE. VARVARA PETROVNA SEEMED TO BE VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH HER EXPEDITION. IN HER OWN OPINION SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN COMING TO A SATISFACTORY UNDERSTANDING WITH PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA, AND IMMEDIATELY ON HER ARRIVAL SHE CONFIDED EVERYTHING TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. SHE WAS POSITIVELY EFFUSIVE WITH HIM AS SHE HAD NOT BEEN FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

‚ÄÚHURRAH!‚ÄÙ CRIED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, AND SNAPPED HIS FINGERS.

HE WAS IN A PERFECT RAPTURE, ESPECIALLY AS HE HAD SPENT THE WHOLE TIME OF HIS FRIEND‚ÄÔS ABSENCE IN EXTREME DEJECTION. ON SETTING OFF SHE HAD NOT EVEN TAKEN LEAVE OF HIM PROPERLY, AND HAD SAID NOTHING OF HER PLAN TO ‚ÄÚTHAT OLD WOMAN,‚ÄÙ DREADING, PERHAPS, THAT HE MIGHT CHATTER ABOUT IT. SHE WAS CROSS WITH HIM AT THE TIME ON ACCOUNT OF A CONSIDERABLE GAMBLING DEBT WHICH SHE HAD SUDDENLY DISCOVERED. BUT BEFORE SHE LEFT SWITZERLAND SHE HAD FELT THAT ON HER RETURN SHE MUST MAKE UP FOR IT TO HER FORSAKEN FRIEND, ESPECIALLY AS SHE HAD TREATED HIM VERY CURTLY FOR A LONG TIME PAST. HER ABRUPT AND MYSTERIOUS DEPARTURE HAD MADE A PROFOUND AND POIGNANT IMPRESSION ON THE TIMID HEART OF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE HE WAS BESET WITH OTHER DIFFICULTIES AT THE SAME TIME. HE WAS WORRIED BY A VERY CONSIDERABLE MONEY OBLIGATION, WHICH HAD WEIGHED UPON HIM FOR A LONG TIME AND WHICH HE COULD NEVER HOPE TO MEET WITHOUT VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS ASSISTANCE. MOREOVER, IN THE MAY OF THIS YEAR, THE TERM OF OFFICE OF OUR MILD AND GENTLE IVAN OSSIPOVITCH CAME TO AN END. HE WAS SUPERSEDED UNDER RATHER UNPLEASANT CIRCUMSTANCES. THEN, WHILE VARVARA PETROVNA WAS STILL AWAY, THERE FOLLOWED THE ARRIVAL OF OUR NEW GOVERNOR, ANDREY ANTONOVITCH VON LEMBKE, AND WITH THAT A CHANGE BEGAN AT ONCE TO BE PERCEPTIBLE IN THE ATTITUDE OF ALMOST THE WHOLE OF OUR PROVINCIAL SOCIETY TOWARDS VARVARA PETROVNA, AND CONSEQUENTLY TOWARDS STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. HE HAD ALREADY HAD TIME ANYWAY TO MAKE SOME DISAGREEABLE THOUGH VALUABLE OBSERVATIONS, AND SEEMED VERY APPREHENSIVE ALONE WITHOUT VARVARA PETROVNA. HE HAD AN AGITATING SUSPICION THAT HE HAD ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED TO THE GOVERNOR AS A DANGEROUS MAN. HE KNEW FOR A FACT THAT SOME OF OUR LADIES MEANT TO GIVE UP CALLING ON VARVARA PETROVNA. OF OUR GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE (WHO WAS ONLY EXPECTED TO ARRIVE IN THE AUTUMN) IT WAS REPORTED THAT THOUGH SHE WAS, SO IT WAS HEARD, PROUD, SHE WAS A REAL ARISTOCRAT, AND ‚ÄÚNOT LIKE THAT POOR VARVARA PETROVNA.‚ÄÙ EVERYBODY SEEMED TO KNOW FOR A FACT, AND IN THE GREATEST DETAIL, THAT OUR GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE AND VARVARA PETROVNA HAD MET ALREADY IN SOCIETY AND HAD PARTED ENEMIES, SO THAT THE MERE MENTION OF MADAME VON LEMBKE‚ÄÔS NAME WOULD, IT WAS SAID, MAKE A PAINFUL IMPRESSION ON VARVARA PETROVNA. THE CONFIDENT AND TRIUMPHANT AIR OF VARVARA PETROVNA, THE CONTEMPTUOUS INDIFFERENCE WITH WHICH SHE HEARD OF THE OPINIONS OF OUR PROVINCIAL LADIES AND THE AGITATION IN LOCAL SOCIETY, REVIVED THE FLAGGING SPIRITS OF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH AND CHEERED HIM UP AT ONCE. WITH PECULIAR, GLEEFULLY-OBSEQUIOUS HUMOUR, HE WAS BEGINNING TO DESCRIBE THE NEW GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS ARRIVAL.

‚ÄÚYOU ARE NO DOUBT AWARE, EXCELLENTE AMIE,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, JAUNTILY AND COQUETTISHLY DRAWLING HIS WORDS, ‚ÄÚWHAT IS MEANT BY A RUSSIAN ADMINISTRATOR, SPEAKING GENERALLY, AND WHAT IS MEANT BY A NEW RUSSIAN ADMINISTRATOR, THAT IS THE NEWLY-BAKED, NEWLY-ESTABLISHED ‚Ä¶ CES INTERMINABLES MOTS RUSSES! BUT I DON‚ÄÔT THINK YOU CAN KNOW IN PRACTICE WHAT IS MEANT BY ADMINISTRATIVE ARDOUR, AND WHAT SORT OF THING THAT IS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚADMINISTRATIVE ARDOUR? I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT THAT IS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL ‚Ä¶ VOUS SAVEZ CHEZ NOUS ‚Ä¶ EN UN MOT, SET THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT NONENTITY TO SELL MISERABLE TICKETS AT A RAILWAY STATION, AND THE NONENTITY WILL AT ONCE FEEL PRIVILEGED TO LOOK DOWN ON YOU LIKE A JUPITER, POUR MONTRER SON POUVOIR WHEN YOU GO TO TAKE A TICKET. ‚ÄÒNOW THEN,‚ÄÔ HE SAYS, ‚ÄÒI SHALL SHOW YOU MY POWER‚ÄÔ ‚Ä¶ AND IN THEM IT COMES TO A GENUINE, ADMINISTRATIVE ARDOUR. EN UN MOT, I‚ÄÔVE READ THAT SOME VERGER IN ONE OF OUR RUSSIAN CHURCHES ABROAD‚ÄÎMAIS C‚ÄÔEST TR√®S CURIEUX‚ÄÎDROVE, LITERALLY DROVE A DISTINGUISHED ENGLISH FAMILY, LES DAMES CHARMANTES, OUT OF THE CHURCH BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE LENTEN SERVICE ‚Ä¶ VOUS SAVEZ CES CHANTS ET LE LIVRE DE JOB ‚Ä¶ ON THE SIMPLE PRETEXT THAT ‚ÄÒFOREIGNERS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO LOAF ABOUT A RUSSIAN CHURCH, AND THAT THEY MUST COME AT THE TIME FIXED.‚Ä¶‚ÄÔ AND HE SENT THEM INTO FAINTING FITS.‚Ä¶ THAT VERGER WAS SUFFERING FROM AN ATTACK OF ADMINISTRATIVE ARDOUR, ET IL A MONTR√© SON POUVOIR.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCUT IT SHORT IF YOU CAN, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMR. VON LEMBKE IS MAKING A TOUR OF THE PROVINCE NOW. EN UN MOT, THIS ANDREY ANTONOVITCH, THOUGH HE IS A RUSSIFIED GERMAN AND OF THE ORTHODOX PERSUASION, AND EVEN‚ÄÎI WILL SAY THAT FOR HIM‚ÄÎA REMARKABLY HANDSOME MAN OF ABOUT FORTY ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT MAKES YOU THINK HE‚ÄÔS A HANDSOME MAN? HE HAS EYES LIKE A SHEEP‚ÄÔS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPRECISELY SO. BUT IN THIS I YIELD, OF COURSE, TO THE OPINION OF OUR LADIES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLET‚ÄÔS GET ON, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, I BEG YOU! BY THE WAY, YOU‚ÄÔRE WEARING A RED NECK-TIE. IS IT LONG SINCE YOU‚ÄÔVE TAKEN TO IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔVE ONLY PUT IT ON TO-DAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND DO YOU TAKE YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL? DO YOU GO FOR A FOUR-MILE WALK EVERY DAY AS THE DOCTOR TOLD YOU TO?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚN-NOT ‚Ä¶ ALWAYS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNEW YOU DIDN‚ÄÔT! I FELT SURE OF THAT WHEN I WAS IN SWITZERLAND!‚ÄÙ SHE CRIED IRRITABLY. ‚ÄÚNOW YOU MUST GO NOT FOUR BUT SIX MILES A DAY! YOU‚ÄÔVE GROWN TERRIBLY SLACK, TERRIBLY, TERRIBLY! YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT SIMPLY GETTING OLD, YOU‚ÄÔRE GETTING DECREPIT.‚Ä¶ YOU SHOCKED ME WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU JUST NOW, IN SPITE OF YOUR RED TIE, QUELLE IDEE ROUGE! GO ON ABOUT VON LEMBKE IF YOU‚ÄÔVE REALLY SOMETHING TO TELL ME, AND DO FINISH SOME TIME, I ENTREAT YOU, I‚ÄÔM TIRED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEN UN MOT, I ONLY WANTED TO SAY THAT HE IS ONE OF THOSE ADMINISTRATORS WHO BEGIN TO HAVE POWER AT FORTY, WHO, TILL THEY‚ÄÔRE FORTY, HAVE BEEN STAGNATING IN INSIGNIFICANCE AND THEN SUDDENLY COME TO THE FRONT THROUGH SUDDENLY ACQUIRING A WIFE, OR SOME OTHER EQUALLY DESPERATE MEANS.‚Ä¶ THAT IS, HE HAS GONE AWAY NOW ‚Ä¶ THAT IS, I MEAN TO SAY, IT WAS AT ONCE WHISPERED IN BOTH HIS EARS THAT I AM A CORRUPTER OF YOUTH, AND A HOT-BED OF PROVINCIAL ATHEISM.‚Ä¶ HE BEGAN MAKING INQUIRIES AT ONCE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIS THAT TRUE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI TOOK STEPS ABOUT IT, IN FACT. WHEN HE WAS ‚ÄÒINFORMED‚ÄÔ THAT YOU ‚ÄÒRULED THE PROVINCE,‚ÄÔ VOUS SAVEZ, HE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO USE THE EXPRESSION THAT ‚ÄÒTHERE SHALL BE NOTHING OF THAT SORT IN THE FUTURE.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDID HE SAY THAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT ‚ÄÒTHERE SHALL BE NOTHING OF THE SORT IN FUTURE,‚ÄÔ AND, AVEC CETTE MORGUE.‚Ä¶ HIS WIFE, YULIA MIHAILOVNA, WE SHALL BEHOLD AT THE END OF AUGUST, SHE‚ÄÔS COMING STRAIGHT FROM PETERSBURG.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFROM ABROAD. WE MET THERE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚVRAIMENT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIN PARIS AND IN SWITZERLAND. SHE‚ÄÔS RELATED TO THE DROZDOVS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚRELATED! WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY COINCIDENCE! THEY SAY SHE IS AMBITIOUS AND ‚Ä¶ SUPPOSED TO HAVE GREAT CONNECTIONS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNONSENSE! CONNECTIONS INDEED! SHE WAS AN OLD MAID WITHOUT A FARTHING TILL SHE WAS FIVE-AND-FORTY. BUT NOW SHE‚ÄÔS HOOKED HER VON LEMBKE, AND, OF COURSE, HER WHOLE OBJECT IS TO PUSH HIM FORWARD. THEY‚ÄÔRE BOTH INTRIGUERS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND THEY SAY SHE‚ÄÔS TWO YEARS OLDER THAN HE IS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFIVE. HER MOTHER USED TO WEAR OUT HER SKIRTS ON MY DOORSTEPS IN MOSCOW; SHE USED TO BEG FOR AN INVITATION TO OUR BALLS AS A FAVOUR WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS LIVING. AND THIS CREATURE USED TO SIT ALL NIGHT ALONE IN A CORNER WITHOUT DANCING, WITH HER TURQUOISE FLY ON HER FOREHEAD, SO THAT SIMPLY FROM PITY I USED TO HAVE TO SEND HER HER FIRST PARTNER AT TWO O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE MORNING. SHE WAS FIVE-AND-TWENTY THEN, AND THEY USED TO RIG HER OUT IN SHORT SKIRTS LIKE A LITTLE GIRL. IT WAS IMPROPER TO HAVE THEM ABOUT AT LAST.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SEEM TO SEE THAT FLY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI TELL YOU, AS SOON AS I ARRIVED I WAS IN THE THICK OF AN INTRIGUE. YOU READ MADAME DROZDOV‚ÄÔS LETTER, OF COURSE. WHAT COULD BE CLEARER? WHAT DID I FIND? THAT FOOL PRASKOVYA HERSELF‚ÄÎSHE ALWAYS WAS A FOOL‚ÄÎLOOKED AT ME AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHY I‚ÄÔD COME. YOU CAN FANCY HOW SURPRISED I WAS. I LOOKED ROUND, AND THERE WAS THAT LEMBKE WOMAN AT HER TRICKS, AND THAT COUSIN OF HERS‚ÄÎOLD DROZDOV‚ÄÔS NEPHEW‚ÄÎIT WAS ALL CLEAR. YOU MAY BE SURE I CHANGED ALL THAT IN A TWINKLING, AND PRASKOVYA IS ON MY SIDE AGAIN, BUT WHAT AN INTRIGUE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIN WHICH YOU CAME OFF VICTOR, HOWEVER. BISMARCK!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWITHOUT BEING A BISMARCK I‚ÄÔM EQUAL TO FALSENESS AND STUPIDITY WHEREVER I MEET IT, FALSENESS, AND PRASKOVYA‚ÄÔS FOLLY. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHEN I‚ÄÔVE MET SUCH A FLABBY WOMAN, AND WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE HER LEGS ARE SWOLLEN, AND SHE‚ÄÔS A GOOD-NATURED SIMPLETON, TOO. WHAT CAN BE MORE FOOLISH THAN A GOOD-NATURED SIMPLETON?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚA SPITEFUL FOOL, MA BONNE AMIE, A SPITEFUL FOOL IS STILL MORE FOOLISH,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH PROTESTED MAGNANIMOUSLY.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE RIGHT, PERHAPS. DO YOU REMEMBER LIZA?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCHARMANTE ENFANT!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT SHE‚ÄÔS NOT AN ENFANT NOW, BUT A WOMAN, AND A WOMAN OF CHARACTER. SHE‚ÄÔS A GENEROUS, PASSIONATE CREATURE, AND WHAT I LIKE ABOUT HER, SHE STANDS UP TO THAT CONFIDING FOOL, HER MOTHER. THERE WAS ALMOST A ROW OVER THAT COUSIN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBAH, AND OF COURSE HE‚ÄÔS NO RELATION OF LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA‚ÄÔS AT ALL.‚Ä¶ HAS HE DESIGNS ON HER?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU SEE, HE‚ÄÔS A YOUNG OFFICER, NOT BY ANY MEANS TALKATIVE, MODEST IN FACT. I ALWAYS WANT TO BE JUST. I FANCY HE IS OPPOSED TO THE INTRIGUE HIMSELF, AND ISN‚ÄÔT AIMING AT ANYTHING, AND IT WAS ONLY THE VON LEMBKE‚ÄÔS TRICKS. HE HAD A GREAT RESPECT FOR NICOLAS. YOU UNDERSTAND, IT ALL DEPENDS ON LIZA. BUT I LEFT HER ON THE BEST OF TERMS WITH NICOLAS, AND HE PROMISED HE WOULD COME TO US IN NOVEMBER. SO IT‚ÄÔS ONLY THE VON LEMBKE WHO IS INTRIGUING, AND PRASKOVYA IS A BLIND WOMAN. SHE SUDDENLY TELLS ME THAT ALL MY SUSPICIONS ARE FANCY. I TOLD HER TO HER FACE SHE WAS A FOOL. I AM READY TO REPEAT IT AT THE DAY OF JUDGMENT. AND IF IT HADN‚ÄÔT BEEN FOR NICOLAS BEGGING ME TO LEAVE IT FOR A TIME, I WOULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE COME AWAY WITHOUT UNMASKING THAT FALSE WOMAN. SHE‚ÄÔS BEEN TRYING TO INGRATIATE HERSELF WITH COUNT K. THROUGH NICOLAS. SHE WANTS TO COME BETWEEN MOTHER AND SON. BUT LIZA‚ÄÔS ON OUR SIDE, AND I CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH PRASKOVYA. DO YOU KNOW THAT KARMAZINOV IS A RELATION OF HERS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT? A RELATION OF MADAME VON LEMBKE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, OF HERS. DISTANT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚKARMAZINOV, THE NOVELIST?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, THE WRITER. WHY DOES IT SURPRISE YOU? OF COURSE HE CONSIDERS HIMSELF A GREAT MAN. STUCK-UP CREATURE! SHE‚ÄÔS COMING HERE WITH HIM. NOW SHE‚ÄÔS MAKING A FUSS OF HIM OUT THERE. SHE‚ÄÔS GOT A NOTION OF SETTING UP A SORT OF LITERARY SOCIETY HERE. HE‚ÄÔS COMING FOR A MONTH, HE WANTS TO SELL HIS LAST PIECE OF PROPERTY HERE. I VERY NEARLY MET HIM IN SWITZERLAND, AND WAS VERY ANXIOUS NOT TO. THOUGH I HOPE HE WILL DEIGN TO RECOGNISE ME. HE WROTE LETTERS TO ME IN THE OLD DAYS, HE HAS BEEN IN MY HOUSE. I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO DRESS BETTER, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH; YOU‚ÄÔRE GROWING MORE SLOVENLY EVERY DAY.‚Ä¶ OH, HOW YOU TORMENT ME! WHAT ARE YOU READING NOW?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI ‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI UNDERSTAND. THE SAME AS EVER, FRIENDS AND DRINKING, THE CLUB AND CARDS, AND THE REPUTATION OF AN ATHEIST. I DON‚ÄÔT LIKE THAT REPUTATION, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH; I DON‚ÄÔT CARE FOR YOU TO BE CALLED AN ATHEIST, PARTICULARLY NOW. I DIDN‚ÄÔT CARE FOR IT IN OLD DAYS, FOR IT‚ÄÔS ALL NOTHING BUT EMPTY CHATTER. IT MUST BE SAID AT LAST.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMAIS, MA CH√®RE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLISTEN, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, OF COURSE I‚ÄÔM IGNORANT COMPARED WITH YOU ON ALL LEARNED SUBJECTS, BUT AS I WAS TRAVELLING HERE I THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT YOU. I‚ÄÔVE COME TO ONE CONCLUSION.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT CONCLUSION?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT YOU AND I ARE NOT THE WISEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, BUT THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WISER THAN WE ARE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWITTY AND APT. IF THERE ARE PEOPLE WISER THAN WE ARE, THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE MORE RIGHT THAN WE ARE, AND WE MAY BE MISTAKEN, YOU MEAN? MAIS, MA BONNE AMIE, GRANTED THAT I MAY MAKE A MISTAKE, YET HAVE I NOT THE COMMON, HUMAN, ETERNAL, SUPREME RIGHT OF FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE? I HAVE THE RIGHT NOT TO BE BIGOTED OR SUPERSTITIOUS IF I DON‚ÄÔT WISH TO, AND FOR THAT I SHALL NATURALLY BE HATED BY CERTAIN PERSONS TO THE END OF TIME. ET PUIS, COMME ON TROUVE TOUJOURS PLUS DE MOINES QUE DE RAISON, AND AS I THOROUGHLY AGREE WITH THAT ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT, WHAT DID YOU SAY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SAID, ON TROUVE TOUJOURS PLUS DE MOINES QUE DE RAISON, AND AS I THOROUGHLY ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM SURE THAT‚ÄÔS NOT YOUR SAYING. YOU MUST HAVE TAKEN IT FROM SOMEWHERE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT WAS PASCAL SAID THAT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚJUST AS I THOUGHT ‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS NOT YOUR OWN. WHY DON‚ÄÔT YOU EVER SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT YOURSELF, SO SHORTLY AND TO THE POINT, INSTEAD OF DRAGGING THINGS OUT TO SUCH A LENGTH? THAT‚ÄÔS MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT YOU SAID JUST NOW ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE ARDOUR ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMA FOI, CH√®RE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ WHY? IN THE FIRST PLACE PROBABLY BECAUSE I‚ÄÔM NOT A PASCAL AFTER ALL, ET PUIS ‚Ä¶ SECONDLY, WE RUSSIANS NEVER CAN SAY ANYTHING IN OUR OWN LANGUAGE.‚Ä¶ WE NEVER HAVE SAID ANYTHING HITHERTO, AT ANY RATE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚH‚ÄÔM! THAT‚ÄÔS NOT TRUE, PERHAPS. ANYWAY, YOU‚ÄÔD BETTER MAKE A NOTE OF SUCH PHRASES, AND REMEMBER THEM, YOU KNOW, IN CASE YOU HAVE TO TALK.‚Ä¶ ACH, STEPHAN TROFIMOVITCH. I HAVE COME TO TALK TO YOU SERIOUSLY, QUITE SERIOUSLY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCH√®RE, CH√®RE AMIE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOW THAT ALL THESE VON LEMBKES AND KARMAZINOVS.‚Ä¶ OH, MY GOODNESS, HOW YOU HAVE DETERIORATED!‚Ä¶ OH, MY GOODNESS, HOW YOU DO TORMENT ME!‚Ä¶ I SHOULD HAVE LIKED THESE PEOPLE TO FEEL A RESPECT FOR YOU, FOR THEY‚ÄÔRE NOT WORTH YOUR LITTLE FINGER‚ÄÎBUT THE WAY YOU BEHAVE!‚Ä¶ WHAT WILL THEY SEE? WHAT SHALL I HAVE TO SHOW THEM? INSTEAD OF NOBLY STANDING AS AN EXAMPLE, KEEPING UP THE TRADITION OF THE PAST, YOU SURROUND YOURSELF WITH A WRETCHED RABBLE, YOU HAVE PICKED UP IMPOSSIBLE HABITS, YOU‚ÄÔVE GROWN FEEBLE, YOU CAN‚ÄÔT DO WITHOUT WINE AND CARDS, YOU READ NOTHING BUT PAUL DE KOCK, AND WRITE NOTHING, WHILE ALL OF THEM WRITE; ALL YOUR TIME‚ÄÔS WASTED IN GOSSIP. HOW CAN YOU BRING YOURSELF TO BE FRIENDS WITH A WRETCHED CREATURE LIKE YOUR INSEPARABLE LIPUTIN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY IS HE MINE AND INSEPARABLE?‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH PROTESTED TIMIDLY.

‚ÄÚWHERE IS HE NOW?‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA WENT ON, SHARPLY AND STERNLY.

‚ÄÚHE ‚Ä¶ HE HAS AN INFINITE RESPECT FOR YOU, AND HE‚ÄÔS GONE TO S‚ÄÎ‚ÄÎK, TO RECEIVE AN INHERITANCE LEFT HIM BY HIS MOTHER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE SEEMS TO DO NOTHING BUT GET MONEY. AND HOW‚ÄÔS SHATOV? IS HE JUST THE SAME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIRASCIBLE, MAIS BON.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI CAN‚ÄÔT ENDURE YOUR SHATOV. HE‚ÄÔS SPITEFUL AND HE THINKS TOO MUCH OF HIMSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW IS DARYA PAVLOVNA?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU MEAN DASHA? WHAT MADE YOU THINK OF HER?‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA LOOKED AT HIM INQUISITIVELY. ‚ÄÚSHE‚ÄÔS QUITE WELL. I LEFT HER WITH THE DROZDOVS. I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR SON IN SWITZERLAND. NOTHING GOOD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, C‚ÄÔEST UN HISTOIRE BIEN B√™TE! JE VOUS ATTENDAIS, MA BONNE AMIE, POUR VOUS RACONTER ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚENOUGH, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. LEAVE ME IN PEACE. I‚ÄÔM WORN OUT. WE SHALL HAVE TIME TO TALK TO OUR HEART‚ÄÔS CONTENT, ESPECIALLY OF WHAT‚ÄÔS UNPLEASANT. YOU‚ÄÔVE BEGUN TO SPLUTTER WHEN YOU LAUGH, IT‚ÄÔS A SIGN OF SENILITY! AND WHAT A STRANGE WAY OF LAUGHING YOU‚ÄÔVE TAKEN TO!‚Ä¶ GOOD HEAVENS, WHAT A LOT OF BAD HABITS YOU‚ÄÔVE FALLEN INTO! KARMAZINOV WON‚ÄÔT COME AND SEE YOU! AND PEOPLE ARE ONLY TOO GLAD TO MAKE THE MOST OF ANYTHING AS IT IS.‚Ä¶ YOU‚ÄÔVE BETRAYED YOURSELF COMPLETELY NOW. WELL, COME, THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH, THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH, I‚ÄÔM TIRED. YOU REALLY MIGHT HAVE MERCY UPON ONE!‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH ‚ÄÚHAD MERCY,‚ÄÙ BUT HE WITHDREW IN GREAT PERTURBATION.

V

OUR FRIEND CERTAINLY HAD FALLEN INTO NOT A FEW BAD HABITS, ESPECIALLY OF LATE. HE HAD OBVIOUSLY AND RAPIDLY DETERIORATED; AND IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD BECOME SLOVENLY. HE DRANK MORE AND HAD BECOME MORE TEARFUL AND NERVOUS; AND HAD GROWN TOO IMPRESSIONABLE ON THE ARTISTIC SIDE. HIS FACE HAD ACQUIRED A STRANGE FACILITY FOR CHANGING WITH EXTRAORDINARY QUICKNESS, FROM THE MOST SOLEMN EXPRESSION, FOR INSTANCE, TO THE MOST ABSURD, AND EVEN FOOLISH. HE COULD NOT ENDURE SOLITUDE, AND WAS ALWAYS CRAVING FOR AMUSEMENT. ONE HAD ALWAYS TO REPEAT TO HIM SOME GOSSIP, SOME LOCAL ANECDOTE, AND EVERY DAY A NEW ONE. IF NO ONE CAME TO SEE HIM FOR A LONG TIME HE WANDERED DISCONSOLATELY ABOUT THE ROOMS, WALKED TO THE WINDOW, PUCKERING UP HIS LIPS, HEAVED DEEP SIGHS, AND ALMOST FELL TO WHIMPERING AT LAST. HE WAS ALWAYS FULL OF FOREBODINGS, WAS AFRAID OF SOMETHING UNEXPECTED AND INEVITABLE; HE HAD BECOME TIMOROUS; HE BEGAN TO PAY GREAT ATTENTION TO HIS DREAMS.

HE SPENT ALL THAT DAY AND EVENING IN GREAT DEPRESSION, HE SENT FOR ME, WAS VERY MUCH AGITATED, TALKED A LONG WHILE, GAVE ME A LONG ACCOUNT OF THINGS, BUT ALL RATHER DISCONNECTED. VARVARA PETROVNA HAD KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME THAT HE CONCEALED NOTHING FROM ME. IT SEEMED TO ME AT LAST THAT HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING PARTICULAR, AND WAS PERHAPS UNABLE TO FORM A DEFINITE IDEA OF IT HIMSELF. AS A RULE WHEN WE MET T√™TE-√†-T√™TE AND HE BEGAN MAKING LONG COMPLAINTS TO ME, A BOTTLE WAS ALMOST ALWAYS BROUGHT IN AFTER A LITTLE TIME, AND THINGS BECAME MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE. THIS TIME THERE WAS NO WINE, AND HE WAS EVIDENTLY STRUGGLING ALL THE WHILE AGAINST THE DESIRE TO SEND FOR IT.

‚ÄÚAND WHY IS SHE ALWAYS SO CROSS?‚ÄÙ HE COMPLAINED EVERY MINUTE, LIKE A CHILD. ‚ÄÚTOUS LES HOMMES DE G√©NIE ET DE PROGR√®S EN RUSSIE √©TAIENT, SONT, ET SERONT TOUJOURS DES GAMBLERS ET DES DRUNKARDS QUI BOIVENT IN OUTBREAKS ‚Ä¶ AND I‚ÄÔM NOT SUCH A GAMBLER AFTER ALL, AND I‚ÄÔM NOT SUCH A DRUNKARD. SHE REPROACHES ME FOR NOT WRITING ANYTHING. STRANGE IDEA!‚Ä¶ SHE ASKS WHY I LIE DOWN? SHE SAYS I OUGHT TO STAND, ‚ÄÒAN EXAMPLE AND REPROACH.‚ÄÔ MAIS, ENTRE NOUS SOIT DIT, WHAT IS A MAN TO DO WHO IS DESTINED TO STAND AS A ‚ÄÒREPROACH,‚ÄÔ IF NOT TO LIE DOWN? DOES SHE UNDERSTAND THAT?‚ÄÙ

AND AT LAST IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME WHAT WAS THE CHIEF PARTICULAR TROUBLE WHICH WAS WORRYING HIM SO PERSISTENTLY AT THIS TIME. MANY TIMES THAT EVENING HE WENT TO THE LOOKING-GLASS, AND STOOD A LONG WHILE BEFORE IT. AT LAST HE TURNED FROM THE LOOKING-GLASS TO ME, AND WITH A SORT OF STRANGE DESPAIR, SAID: ‚ÄÚMON CHER, JE SUIS UN BROKEN-DOWN MAN.‚ÄÙ YES, CERTAINLY, UP TO THAT TIME, UP TO THAT VERY DAY THERE WAS ONE THING ONLY OF WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS FELT CONFIDENT IN SPITE OF THE ‚ÄÚNEW VIEWS,‚ÄÙ AND OF THE ‚ÄÚCHANGE IN VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS IDEAS,‚ÄÙ THAT WAS, THE CONVICTION THAT STILL HE HAD A FASCINATION FOR HER FEMININE HEART, NOT SIMPLY AS AN EXILE OR A CELEBRATED MAN OF LEARNING, BUT AS A HANDSOME MAN. FOR TWENTY YEARS THIS SOOTHING AND FLATTERING OPINION HAD BEEN ROOTED IN HIS MIND, AND PERHAPS OF ALL HIS CONVICTIONS THIS WAS THE HARDEST TO PART WITH. HAD HE ANY PRESENTIMENT THAT EVENING OF THE COLOSSAL ORDEAL WHICH WAS PREPARING FOR HIM IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE?

VI

I WILL NOW ENTER UPON THE DESCRIPTION OF THAT ALMOST FORGOTTEN INCIDENT WITH WHICH MY STORY PROPERLY SPEAKING BEGINS.

AT LAST AT THE VERY END OF AUGUST THE DROZDOVS RETURNED. THEIR ARRIVAL MADE A CONSIDERABLE SENSATION IN LOCAL SOCIETY, AND TOOK PLACE SHORTLY BEFORE THEIR RELATION, OUR NEW GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE, MADE HER LONG-EXPECTED APPEARANCE. BUT OF ALL THESE INTERESTING EVENTS I WILL SPEAK LATER. FOR THE PRESENT I WILL CONFINE MYSELF TO SAYING THAT PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA BROUGHT VARVARA PETROVNA, WHO WAS EXPECTING HER SO IMPATIENTLY, A MOST PERPLEXING PROBLEM: NIKOLAY HAD PARTED FROM THEM IN JULY, AND, MEETING COUNT K. ON THE RHINE, HAD SET OFF WITH HIM AND HIS FAMILY FOR PETERSBURG. (N.B.‚ÄÎTHE COUNT‚ÄÔS THREE DAUGHTERS WERE ALL OF MARRIAGEABLE AGE.)

‚ÄÚLIZAVETA IS SO PROUD AND OBSTINATE THAT I COULD GET NOTHING OUT OF HER,‚ÄÙ PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA SAID IN CONCLUSION. ‚ÄÚBUT I SAW FOR MYSELF THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED BETWEEN HER AND NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW THE REASONS, BUT I FANCY, MY DEAR VARVARA PETROVNA, THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK YOUR DARYA PAVLOVNA FOR THEM. TO MY THINKING LIZA WAS OFFENDED. I‚ÄÔM GLAD. I CAN TELL YOU THAT I‚ÄÔVE BROUGHT YOU BACK YOUR FAVOURITE AT LAST AND HANDED HER OVER TO YOU; IT‚ÄÔS A WEIGHT OFF MY MIND.‚ÄÙ

THESE VENOMOUS WORDS WERE UTTERED WITH REMARKABLE IRRITABILITY. IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE ‚ÄÚFLABBY‚ÄÙ WOMAN HAD PREPARED THEM AND GLOATED BEFOREHAND OVER THE EFFECT THEY WOULD PRODUCE. BUT VARVARA PETROVNA WAS NOT THE WOMAN TO BE DISCONCERTED BY SENTIMENTAL EFFECTS AND ENIGMAS. SHE STERNLY DEMANDED THE MOST PRECISE AND SATISFACTORY EXPLANATIONS. PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA IMMEDIATELY LOWERED HER TONE AND EVEN ENDED BY DISSOLVING INTO TEARS AND EXPRESSIONS OF THE WARMEST FRIENDSHIP. THIS IRRITABLE BUT SENTIMENTAL LADY, LIKE STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, WAS FOREVER YEARNING FOR TRUE FRIENDSHIP, AND HER CHIEF COMPLAINT AGAINST HER DAUGHTER LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA WAS JUST THAT ‚ÄÚHER DAUGHTER WAS NOT A FRIEND TO HER.‚ÄÙ

BUT FROM ALL HER EXPLANATIONS AND OUTPOURINGS NOTHING CERTAIN COULD BE GATHERED BUT THAT THERE ACTUALLY HAD BEEN SOME SORT OF QUARREL BETWEEN LIZA AND NIKOLAY, BUT OF THE NATURE OF THE QUARREL PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA WAS OBVIOUSLY UNABLE TO FORM A DEFINITE IDEA. AS FOR HER IMPUTATIONS AGAINST DARYA PAVLOVNA, SHE NOT ONLY WITHDREW THEM COMPLETELY IN THE END, BUT EVEN PARTICULARLY BEGGED VARVARA PETROVNA TO PAY NO ATTENTION TO HER WORDS, BECAUSE ‚ÄÚTHEY HAD BEEN SAID IN IRRITATION.‚ÄÙ IN FACT, IT HAD ALL BEEN LEFT VERY FAR FROM CLEAR‚ÄÎSUSPICIOUS, INDEED. ACCORDING TO HER ACCOUNT THE QUARREL HAD ARISEN FROM LIZA‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚOBSTINATE AND IRONICAL CHARACTER.‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚNIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH IS PROUD, TOO, AND THOUGH HE WAS VERY MUCH IN LOVE, YET HE COULD NOT ENDURE SARCASM, AND BEGAN TO BE SARCASTIC HIMSELF. SOON AFTERWARDS WE MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF A YOUNG MAN, THE NEPHEW, I BELIEVE, OF YOUR ‚ÄÒPROFESSOR‚ÄÔ AND, INDEED, THE SURNAME‚ÄÔS THE SAME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE SON, NOT THE NEPHEW,‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA CORRECTED HER.

EVEN IN OLD DAYS PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA HAD BEEN ALWAYS UNABLE TO RECALL STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS NAME, AND HAD ALWAYS CALLED HIM THE ‚ÄÚPROFESSOR.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, HIS SON, THEN; SO MUCH THE BETTER. OF COURSE, IT‚ÄÔS ALL THE SAME TO ME. AN ORDINARY YOUNG MAN, VERY LIVELY AND FREE IN HIS MANNERS, BUT NOTHING SPECIAL IN HIM. WELL, THEN, LIZA HERSELF DID WRONG, SHE MADE FRIENDS WITH THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE IDEA OF MAKING NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH JEALOUS. I DON‚ÄÔT SEE MUCH HARM IN THAT; IT‚ÄÔS THE WAY OF GIRLS, QUITE USUAL, EVEN CHARMING IN THEM. ONLY INSTEAD OF BEING JEALOUS NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH MADE FRIENDS WITH THE YOUNG MAN HIMSELF, JUST AS THOUGH HE SAW NOTHING AND DIDN‚ÄÔT CARE. THIS MADE LIZA FURIOUS. THE YOUNG MAN SOON WENT AWAY (HE WAS IN A GREAT HURRY TO GET SOMEWHERE) AND LIZA TOOK TO PICKING QUARRELS WITH NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY. SHE NOTICED THAT HE USED SOMETIMES TO TALK TO DASHA; AND, WELL, SHE GOT IN SUCH A FRANTIC STATE THAT EVEN MY LIFE WASN‚ÄÔT WORTH LIVING, MY DEAR. THE DOCTORS HAVE FORBIDDEN MY BEING IRRITATED, AND I WAS SO SICK OF THEIR LAKE THEY MAKE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT, IT SIMPLY GAVE ME TOOTHACHE, I HAD SUCH RHEUMATISM. IT‚ÄÔS STATED IN PRINT THAT THE LAKE OF GENEVA DOES GIVE PEOPLE THE TOOTHACHE. IT‚ÄÔS A FEATURE OF THE PLACE. THEN NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SUDDENLY GOT A LETTER FROM THE COUNTESS AND HE LEFT US AT ONCE. HE PACKED UP IN ONE DAY. THEY PARTED IN A FRIENDLY WAY, AND LIZA BECAME VERY CHEERFUL AND FRIVOLOUS, AND LAUGHED A GREAT DEAL SEEING HIM OFF; ONLY THAT WAS ALL PUT ON. WHEN HE HAD GONE SHE BECAME VERY THOUGHTFUL, AND SHE GAVE UP SPEAKING OF HIM ALTOGETHER AND WOULDN‚ÄÔT LET ME MENTION HIS NAME. AND I SHOULD ADVISE YOU, DEAR VARVARA PETROVNA, NOT TO APPROACH THE SUBJECT WITH LIZA, YOU‚ÄÔLL ONLY DO HARM. BUT IF YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE SHE‚ÄÔLL BEGIN TO TALK OF IT HERSELF, AND THEN YOU‚ÄÔLL LEARN MORE. I BELIEVE THEY‚ÄÔLL COME TOGETHER AGAIN, IF ONLY NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH DOESN‚ÄÔT PUT OFF COMING, AS HE PROMISED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL WRITE TO HIM AT ONCE. IF THAT‚ÄÔS HOW IT WAS, THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE QUARREL; ALL NONSENSE! AND I KNOW DARYA TOO WELL. IT‚ÄÔS NONSENSE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM SORRY FOR WHAT I SAID ABOUT DASHENKA, I DID WRONG. THEIR CONVERSATIONS WERE QUITE ORDINARY AND THEY TALKED OUT LOUD, TOO. BUT IT ALL UPSET ME SO MUCH AT THE TIME, MY DEAR. AND LIZA, I SAW, GOT ON WITH HER AGAIN AS AFFECTIONATELY AS BEFORE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

THAT VERY DAY VARVARA PETROVNA WROTE TO NIKOLAY, AND BEGGED HIM TO COME, IF ONLY ONE MONTH, EARLIER THAN THE DATE HE HAD FIXED. BUT YET SHE STILL FELT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING UNEXPLAINED AND OBSCURE IN THE MATTER. SHE PONDERED OVER IT ALL THE EVENING AND ALL NIGHT. PRASKOVYA‚ÄÔS OPINION SEEMED TO HER TOO INNOCENT AND SENTIMENTAL. ‚ÄÚPRASKOVYA HAS ALWAYS BEEN TOO SENTIMENTAL FROM THE OLD SCHOOLDAYS UPWARDS,‚ÄÙ SHE REFLECTED. ‚ÄÚNICOLAS IS NOT THE MAN TO RUN AWAY FROM A GIRL‚ÄÔS TAUNTS. THERE‚ÄÔS SOME OTHER REASON FOR IT, IF THERE REALLY HAS BEEN A BREACH BETWEEN THEM. THAT OFFICER‚ÄÔS HERE THOUGH, THEY‚ÄÔVE BROUGHT HIM WITH THEM. AS A RELATION HE LIVES IN THEIR HOUSE. AND, AS FOR DARYA, PRASKOVYA WAS IN TOO MUCH HASTE TO APOLOGISE. SHE MUST HAVE KEPT SOMETHING TO HERSELF, WHICH SHE WOULDN‚ÄÔT TELL ME.‚ÄÙ

BY THE MORNING VARVARA PETROVNA HAD MATURED A PROJECT FOR PUTTING A STOP ONCE FOR ALL TO ONE MISUNDERSTANDING AT LEAST; A PROJECT AMAZING IN ITS UNEXPECTEDNESS. WHAT WAS IN HER HEART WHEN SHE CONCEIVED IT? IT WOULD BE HARD TO DECIDE AND I WILL NOT UNDERTAKE TO EXPLAIN BEFOREHAND ALL THE INCONGRUITIES OF WHICH IT WAS MADE UP. I SIMPLY CONFINE MYSELF AS CHRONICLER TO RECORDING EVENTS PRECISELY AS THEY HAPPENED, AND IT IS NOT MY FAULT IF THEY SEEM INCREDIBLE. YET I MUST ONCE MORE TESTIFY THAT BY THE MORNING THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST SUSPICION OF DASHA LEFT IN VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS MIND, THOUGH IN REALITY THERE NEVER HAD BEEN ANY‚ÄÎSHE HAD TOO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HER. BESIDES, SHE COULD NOT ADMIT THE IDEA THAT ‚ÄÚNICOLAS‚ÄÙ COULD BE ATTRACTED BY HER DARYA. NEXT MORNING WHEN DARYA PAVLOVNA WAS POURING OUT TEA AT THE TABLE VARVARA PETROVNA LOOKED FOR A LONG WHILE INTENTLY AT HER AND, PERHAPS FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME SINCE THE PREVIOUS DAY, REPEATED TO HERSELF: ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS ALL NONSENSE!‚ÄÙ

ALL SHE NOTICED WAS THAT DASHA LOOKED RATHER TIRED, AND THAT SHE WAS EVEN QUIETER AND MORE APATHETIC THAN SHE USED TO BE. AFTER THEIR MORNING TEA, ACCORDING TO THEIR INVARIABLE CUSTOM, THEY SAT DOWN TO NEEDLEWORK. VARVARA PETROVNA DEMANDED FROM HER A FULL ACCOUNT OF HER IMPRESSIONS ABROAD, ESPECIALLY OF NATURE, OF THE INHABITANTS, OF THE TOWNS, THE CUSTOMS, THEIR ARTS AND COMMERCE‚ÄÎOF EVERYTHING SHE HAD TIME TO OBSERVE. SHE ASKED NO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DROZDOVS OR HOW SHE HAD GOT ON WITH THEM. DASHA, SITTING BESIDE HER AT THE WORK-TABLE HELPING HER WITH THE EMBROIDERY, TALKED FOR HALF AN HOUR IN HER EVEN, MONOTONOUS, BUT RATHER WEAK VOICE.

‚ÄÚDARYA!‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA INTERRUPTED SUDDENLY, ‚ÄÚIS THERE NOTHING SPECIAL YOU WANT TO TELL ME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, NOTHING,‚ÄÙ SAID DASHA, AFTER A MOMENT‚ÄÔS THOUGHT, AND SHE GLANCED AT VARVARA PETROVNA WITH HER LIGHT-COLOURED EYES.

‚ÄÚNOTHING ON YOUR SOUL, ON YOUR HEART, OR YOUR CONSCIENCE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOTHING,‚ÄÙ DASHA REPEATED, QUIETLY, BUT WITH A SORT OF SULLEN FIRMNESS.

‚ÄÚI KNEW THERE WASN‚ÄÔT! BELIEVE ME, DARYA, I SHALL NEVER DOUBT YOU. NOW SIT STILL AND LISTEN. IN FRONT OF ME, ON THAT CHAIR. I WANT TO SEE THE WHOLE OF YOU. THAT‚ÄÔS RIGHT. LISTEN, DO YOU WANT TO BE MARRIED?‚ÄÙ

DASHA RESPONDED WITH A LONG, INQUIRING, BUT NOT GREATLY ASTONISHED LOOK.

‚ÄÚSTAY, HOLD YOUR TONGUE. IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE IS A VERY GREAT DIFFERENCE IN AGE, BUT OF COURSE YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE WHAT NONSENSE THAT IS. YOU‚ÄÔRE A SENSIBLE GIRL, AND THERE MUST BE NO MISTAKES IN YOUR LIFE. BESIDES, HE‚ÄÔS STILL A HANDSOME MAN ‚Ä¶ IN SHORT, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, FOR WHOM YOU HAVE ALWAYS HAD SUCH A RESPECT. WELL?‚ÄÙ

DASHA LOOKED AT HER STILL MORE INQUIRINGLY, AND THIS TIME NOT SIMPLY WITH SURPRISE; SHE BLUSHED PERCEPTIBLY.

‚ÄÚSTAY, HOLD YOUR TONGUE, DON‚ÄÔT BE IN A HURRY! THOUGH YOU WILL HAVE MONEY UNDER MY WILL, YET WHEN I DIE, WHAT WILL BECOME OF YOU, EVEN IF YOU HAVE MONEY? YOU‚ÄÔLL BE DECEIVED AND ROBBED OF YOUR MONEY, YOU‚ÄÔLL BE LOST IN FACT. BUT MARRIED TO HIM YOU‚ÄÔRE THE WIFE OF A DISTINGUISHED MAN. LOOK AT HIM ON THE OTHER HAND. THOUGH I‚ÄÔVE PROVIDED FOR HIM, IF I DIE WHAT WILL BECOME OF HIM? BUT I COULD TRUST HIM TO YOU. STAY, I‚ÄÔVE NOT FINISHED. HE‚ÄÔS FRIVOLOUS, SHILLY-SHALLY, CRUEL, EGOISTIC, HE HAS LOW HABITS. BUT MIND YOU THINK HIGHLY OF HIM, IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY WORSE. I DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO GET YOU OFF MY HANDS BY MARRYING YOU TO A RASCAL, YOU DON‚ÄÔT IMAGINE ANYTHING OF THAT SORT, DO YOU? AND, ABOVE ALL, BECAUSE I ASK YOU, YOU‚ÄÔLL THINK HIGHLY OF HIM,‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎ

SHE BROKE OFF SUDDENLY AND IRRITABLY. ‚ÄÚDO YOU HEAR? WHY WON‚ÄÔT YOU SAY SOMETHING?‚ÄÙ

DASHA STILL LISTENED AND DID NOT SPEAK.

‚ÄÚSTAY, WAIT A LITTLE. HE‚ÄÔS AN OLD WOMAN, BUT YOU KNOW, THAT‚ÄÔS ALL THE BETTER FOR YOU. BESIDES, HE‚ÄÔS A PATHETIC OLD WOMAN. HE DOESN‚ÄÔT DESERVE TO BE LOVED BY A WOMAN AT ALL, BUT HE DESERVES TO BE LOVED FOR HIS HELPLESSNESS, AND YOU MUST LOVE HIM FOR HIS HELPLESSNESS. YOU UNDERSTAND ME, DON‚ÄÔT YOU? DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?‚ÄÙ

DASHA NODDED HER HEAD AFFIRMATIVELY.

‚ÄÚI KNEW YOU WOULD. I EXPECTED AS MUCH OF YOU. HE WILL LOVE YOU BECAUSE HE OUGHT, HE OUGHT; HE OUGHT TO ADORE YOU.‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA ALMOST SHRIEKED WITH PECULIAR EXASPERATION. ‚ÄÚBESIDES, HE WILL BE IN LOVE WITH YOU WITHOUT ANY OUGHT ABOUT IT. I KNOW HIM. AND ANOTHER THING, I SHALL ALWAYS BE HERE. YOU MAY BE SURE I SHALL ALWAYS BE HERE. HE WILL COMPLAIN OF YOU, HE‚ÄÔLL BEGIN TO SAY THINGS AGAINST YOU BEHIND YOUR BACK, HE‚ÄÔLL WHISPER THINGS AGAINST YOU TO ANY STRAY PERSON HE MEETS, HE‚ÄÔLL BE FOR EVER WHINING AND WHINING; HE‚ÄÔLL WRITE YOU LETTERS FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER, TWO A DAY, BUT HE WON‚ÄÔT BE ABLE TO GET ON WITHOUT YOU ALL THE SAME, AND THAT‚ÄÔS THE CHIEF THING. MAKE HIM OBEY YOU. IF YOU CAN‚ÄÔT MAKE HIM YOU‚ÄÔLL BE A FOOL. HE‚ÄÔLL WANT TO HANG HIMSELF AND THREATEN, TO‚ÄÎDON‚ÄÔT YOU BELIEVE IT. IT‚ÄÔS NOTHING BUT NONSENSE. DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE IT; BUT STILL KEEP A SHARP LOOK-OUT, YOU NEVER CAN TELL, AND ONE DAY HE MAY HANG HIMSELF. IT DOES HAPPEN WITH PEOPLE LIKE THAT. IT‚ÄÔS NOT THROUGH STRENGTH OF WILL BUT THROUGH WEAKNESS THAT PEOPLE HANG THEMSELVES, AND SO NEVER DRIVE HIM TO AN EXTREME, THAT‚ÄÔS THE FIRST RULE IN MARRIED LIFE. REMEMBER, TOO, THAT HE‚ÄÔS A POET. LISTEN, DASHA, THERE‚ÄÔS NO GREATER HAPPINESS THAN SELF-SACRIFICE. AND BESIDES, YOU‚ÄÔLL BE GIVING ME GREAT SATISFACTION AND THAT‚ÄÔS THE CHIEF THING. DON‚ÄÔT THINK I‚ÄÔVE BEEN TALKING NONSENSE. I UNDERSTAND WHAT I‚ÄÔM SAYING. I‚ÄÔM AN EGOIST, YOU BE AN EGOIST, TOO. OF COURSE I‚ÄÔM NOT FORCING YOU. IT‚ÄÔS ENTIRELY FOR YOU TO DECIDE. AS YOU SAY, SO IT SHALL BE. WELL, WHAT‚ÄÔS THE GOOD OF SITTING LIKE THIS. SPEAK!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT MIND, VARVARA PETROVNA, IF I REALLY MUST BE MARRIED,‚ÄÙ SAID DASHA FIRMLY.

‚ÄÚMUST? WHAT ARE YOU HINTING AT?‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA LOOKED STERNLY AND INTENTLY AT HER.

DASHA WAS SILENT, PICKING AT HER EMBROIDERY CANVAS WITH HER NEEDLE.

‚ÄÚTHOUGH YOU‚ÄÔRE A CLEVER GIRL, YOU‚ÄÔRE TALKING NONSENSE; THOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT I HAVE CERTAINLY SET MY HEART ON MARRYING YOU, YET IT‚ÄÔS NOT BECAUSE IT‚ÄÔS NECESSARY, BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE IDEA HAS OCCURRED TO ME, AND ONLY TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF MARRYING YOU YET, THOUGH YOU ARE TWENTY.‚Ä¶ WELL?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL DO AS YOU WISH, VARVARA PETROVNA.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEN YOU CONSENT! STAY, BE QUIET. WHY ARE YOU IN SUCH A HURRY? I HAVEN‚ÄÔT FINISHED. IN MY WILL I‚ÄÔVE LEFT YOU FIFTEEN THOUSAND ROUBLES. I‚ÄÔLL GIVE YOU THAT AT ONCE, ON YOUR WEDDING-DAY. YOU WILL GIVE EIGHT THOUSAND OF IT TO HIM; THAT IS, NOT TO HIM BUT TO ME. HE HAS A DEBT OF EIGHT THOUSAND. I‚ÄÔLL PAY IT, BUT HE MUST KNOW THAT IT IS DONE WITH YOUR MONEY. YOU‚ÄÔLL HAVE SEVEN THOUSAND LEFT IN YOUR HANDS. NEVER LET HIM TOUCH A FARTHING OF IT. DON‚ÄÔT PAY HIS DEBTS EVER. IF ONCE YOU PAY THEM, YOU‚ÄÔLL NEVER BE FREE OF THEM. BESIDES, I SHALL ALWAYS BE HERE. YOU SHALL HAVE TWELVE HUNDRED ROUBLES A YEAR FROM ME, WITH EXTRAS, FIFTEEN HUNDRED, BESIDES BOARD AND LODGING, WHICH SHALL BE AT MY EXPENSE, JUST AS HE HAS IT NOW. ONLY YOU MUST SET UP YOUR OWN SERVANTS. YOUR YEARLY ALLOWANCE SHALL BE PAID TO YOU ALL AT ONCE STRAIGHT INTO YOUR HANDS. BUT BE KIND, AND SOMETIMES GIVE HIM SOMETHING, AND LET HIS FRIENDS COME TO SEE HIM ONCE A WEEK, BUT IF THEY COME MORE OFTEN, TURN THEM OUT. BUT I SHALL BE HERE, TOO. AND IF I DIE, YOUR PENSION WILL GO ON TILL HIS DEATH, DO YOU HEAR, TILL HIS DEATH, FOR IT‚ÄÔS HIS PENSION, NOT YOURS. AND BESIDES THE SEVEN THOUSAND YOU‚ÄÔLL HAVE NOW, WHICH YOU OUGHT TO KEEP UNTOUCHED IF YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT FOOLISH, I‚ÄÔLL LEAVE YOU ANOTHER EIGHT THOUSAND IN MY WILL. AND YOU‚ÄÔLL GET NOTHING MORE THAN THAT FROM ME, IT‚ÄÔS RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW IT. COME, YOU CONSENT, EH? WILL YOU SAY SOMETHING AT LAST?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI HAVE TOLD YOU ALREADY, VARVARA PETROVNA.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚREMEMBER THAT YOU‚ÄÔRE FREE TO DECIDE. AS YOU LIKE, SO IT SHALL BE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEN, MAY I ASK, VARVARA PETROVNA, HAS STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SAID ANYTHING YET?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, HE HASN‚ÄÔT SAID ANYTHING, HE DOESN‚ÄÔT KNOW ‚Ä¶ BUT HE WILL SPEAK DIRECTLY.‚ÄÙ

SHE JUMPED UP AT ONCE AND THREW ON A BLACK SHAWL. DASHA FLUSHED A LITTLE AGAIN, AND WATCHED HER WITH QUESTIONING EYES. VARVARA PETROVNA TURNED SUDDENLY TO HER WITH A FACE FLAMING WITH ANGER.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE A FOOL!‚ÄÙ SHE SWOOPED DOWN ON HER LIKE A HAWK. ‚ÄÚAN UNGRATEFUL FOOL! WHAT‚ÄÔS IN YOUR MIND? CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT I‚ÄÔD COMPROMISE YOU, IN ANY WAY, IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE. WHY, HE SHALL CRAWL ON HIS KNEES TO ASK YOU, HE MUST BE DYING OF HAPPINESS, THAT‚ÄÔS HOW IT SHALL BE ARRANGED. WHY, YOU KNOW THAT I‚ÄÔD NEVER LET YOU SUFFER. OR DO YOU SUPPOSE HE‚ÄÔLL TAKE YOU FOR THE SAKE OF THAT EIGHT THOUSAND, AND THAT I‚ÄÔM HURRYING OFF TO SELL YOU? YOU‚ÄÔRE A FOOL, A FOOL! YOU‚ÄÔRE ALL UNGRATEFUL FOOLS. GIVE ME MY UMBRELLA!‚ÄÙ

AND SHE FLEW OFF TO WALK BY THE WET BRICK PAVEMENTS AND THE WOODEN PLANKS TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS.

VII

IT WAS TRUE THAT SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE LET DASHA SUFFER; ON THE CONTRARY, SHE CONSIDERED NOW THAT SHE WAS ACTING AS HER BENEFACTRESS. THE MOST GENEROUS AND LEGITIMATE INDIGNATION WAS GLOWING IN HER SOUL, WHEN, AS SHE PUT ON HER SHAWL, SHE CAUGHT FIXED UPON HER THE EMBARRASSED AND MISTRUSTFUL EYES OF HER PROT√©G√©E. SHE HAD GENUINELY LOVED THE GIRL FROM HER CHILDHOOD UPWARDS. PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA HAD WITH JUSTICE CALLED DARYA PAVLOVNA HER FAVOURITE. LONG AGO VARVARA PETROVNA HAD MADE UP HER MIND ONCE FOR ALL THAT ‚ÄÚDARYA‚ÄÔS DISPOSITION WAS NOT LIKE HER BROTHER‚ÄÔS‚ÄÙ (NOT, THAT IS, LIKE IVAN SHATOV‚ÄÔS), THAT SHE WAS QUIET AND GENTLE, AND CAPABLE OF GREAT SELF-SACRIFICE; THAT SHE WAS DISTINGUISHED BY A POWER OF DEVOTION, UNUSUAL MODESTY, RARE REASONABLENESS, AND, ABOVE ALL, BY GRATITUDE. TILL THAT TIME DASHA HAD, TO ALL APPEARANCES, COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED HER EXPECTATIONS.

‚ÄÚIN THAT LIFE THERE WILL BE NO MISTAKES,‚ÄÙ SAID VARVARA PETROVNA WHEN THE GIRL WAS ONLY TWELVE YEARS OLD, AND AS IT WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF HER TO ATTACH HERSELF DOGGEDLY AND PASSIONATELY TO ANY DREAM THAT FASCINATED HER, ANY NEW DESIGN, ANY IDEA THAT STRUCK HER AS NOBLE, SHE MADE UP HER MIND AT ONCE TO EDUCATE DASHA AS THOUGH SHE WERE HER OWN DAUGHTER. SHE AT ONCE SET ASIDE A SUM OF MONEY FOR HER, AND SENT FOR A GOVERNESS, MISS CRIGGS, WHO LIVED WITH THEM UNTIL THE GIRL WAS SIXTEEN, BUT SHE WAS FOR SOME REASON SUDDENLY DISMISSED. TEACHERS CAME FOR HER FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL, AMONG THEM A REAL FRENCHMAN, WHO TAUGHT DASHA FRENCH. HE, TOO, WAS SUDDENLY DISMISSED, ALMOST TURNED OUT OF THE HOUSE. A POOR LADY, A WIDOW OF GOOD FAMILY, TAUGHT HER TO PLAY THE PIANO. YET HER CHIEF TUTOR WAS STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.

IN REALITY HE FIRST DISCOVERED DASHA. HE BEGAN TEACHING THE QUIET CHILD EVEN BEFORE VARVARA PETROVNA HAD BEGUN TO THINK ABOUT HER. I REPEAT AGAIN, IT WAS WONDERFUL HOW CHILDREN TOOK TO HIM. LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA TUSHIN HAD BEEN TAUGHT BY HIM FROM THE AGE OF EIGHT TILL ELEVEN (STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH TOOK NO FEES, OF COURSE, FOR HIS LESSONS, AND WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT HAVE TAKEN PAYMENT FROM THE DROZDOVS). BUT HE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE CHARMING CHILD AND USED TO TELL HER POEMS OF A SORT ABOUT THE CREATION OF THE WORLD, ABOUT THE EARTH, AND THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY. HIS LECTURES ABOUT THE PRIMITIVE PEOPLES AND PRIMITIVE MAN WERE MORE INTERESTING THAN THE ARABIAN NIGHTS. LIZA, WHO WAS ECSTATIC OVER THESE STORIES, USED TO MIMIC STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH VERY FUNNILY AT HOME. HE HEARD OF THIS AND ONCE PEEPED IN ON HER UNAWARES. LIZA, OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION, FLUNG HERSELF INTO HIS ARMS AND SHED TEARS; STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WEPT TOO WITH DELIGHT. BUT LIZA SOON AFTER WENT AWAY, AND ONLY DASHA WAS LEFT. WHEN DASHA BEGAN TO HAVE OTHER TEACHERS, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH GAVE UP HIS LESSONS WITH HER, AND BY DEGREES LEFT OFF NOTICING HER. THINGS WENT ON LIKE THIS FOR A LONG TIME. ONCE WHEN SHE WAS SEVENTEEN HE WAS STRUCK BY HER PRETTINESS. IT HAPPENED AT VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS TABLE. HE BEGAN TO TALK TO THE YOUNG GIRL, WAS MUCH PLEASED WITH HER ANSWERS, AND ENDED BY OFFERING TO GIVE HER A SERIOUS AND COMPREHENSIVE COURSE OF LESSONS ON THE HISTORY OF RUSSIAN LITERATURE. VARVARA PETROVNA APPROVED, AND THANKED HIM FOR HIS EXCELLENT IDEA, AND DASHA WAS DELIGHTED. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH PROCEEDED TO MAKE SPECIAL PREPARATIONS FOR THE LECTURES, AND AT LAST THEY BEGAN. THEY BEGAN WITH THE MOST ANCIENT PERIOD. THE FIRST LECTURE WENT OFF ENCHANTINGLY. VARVARA PETROVNA WAS PRESENT. WHEN STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HAD FINISHED, AND AS HE WAS GOING INFORMED HIS PUPIL THAT THE NEXT TIME HE WOULD DEAL WITH ‚ÄÚTHE STORY OF THE EXPEDITION OF IGOR,‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA SUDDENLY GOT UP AND ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE LESSONS. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WINCED, BUT SAID NOTHING, AND DASHA FLUSHED CRIMSON. IT PUT A STOP TO THE SCHEME, HOWEVER. THIS HAD HAPPENED JUST THREE YEARS BEFORE VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS UNEXPECTED FANCY.

POOR STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS SITTING ALONE FREE FROM ALL MISGIVINGS. PLUNGED IN MOURNFUL REVERIES HE HAD FOR SOME TIME BEEN LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW TO SEE WHETHER ANY OF HIS FRIENDS WERE COMING. BUT NOBODY WOULD COME. IT WAS DRIZZLING. IT WAS TURNING COLD, HE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE STOVE HEATED. HE SIGHED. SUDDENLY A TERRIBLE APPARITION FLASHED UPON HIS EYES:

VARVARA PETROVNA IN SUCH WEATHER AND AT SUCH AN UNEXPECTED HOUR TO SEE HIM! AND ON FOOT! HE WAS SO ASTOUNDED THAT HE FORGOT TO PUT ON HIS COAT, AND RECEIVED HER AS HE WAS, IN HIS EVERLASTING PINK-WADDED DRESSING-JACKET.

‚ÄÚMA BONNE AMIE!‚ÄÙ HE CRIED FAINTLY, TO GREET HER. ‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE ALONE; I‚ÄÔM GLAD; I CAN‚ÄÔT ENDURE YOUR FRIENDS. HOW YOU DO SMOKE! HEAVENS, WHAT AN ATMOSPHERE! YOU HAVEN‚ÄÔT FINISHED YOUR MORNING TEA AND IT‚ÄÔS NEARLY TWELVE O‚ÄÔCLOCK. IT‚ÄÔS YOUR IDEA OF BLISS‚ÄÎDISORDER! YOU TAKE PLEASURE IN DIRT. WHAT‚ÄÔS THAT TORN PAPER ON THE FLOOR? NASTASYA, NASTASYA! WHAT IS YOUR NASTASYA ABOUT? OPEN THE WINDOW, THE CASEMENT, THE DOORS, FLING EVERYTHING WIDE OPEN. AND WE‚ÄÔLL GO INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM. I‚ÄÔVE COME TO YOU ON A MATTER OF IMPORTANCE. AND YOU SWEEP UP, MY GOOD WOMAN, FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEY MAKE SUCH A MUCK!‚ÄÙ NASTASYA WHINED IN A VOICE OF PLAINTIVE EXASPERATION.

‚ÄÚWELL, YOU MUST SWEEP, SWEEP IT UP FIFTEEN TIMES A DAY! YOU‚ÄÔVE A WRETCHED DRAWING-ROOM‚ÄÙ (WHEN THEY HAD GONE INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM). ‚ÄÚSHUT THE DOOR PROPERLY. SHE‚ÄÔLL BE LISTENING. YOU MUST HAVE IT REPAPERED. DIDN‚ÄÔT I SEND A PAPERHANGER TO YOU WITH PATTERNS? WHY DIDN‚ÄÔT YOU CHOOSE ONE? SIT DOWN, AND LISTEN. DO SIT DOWN, I BEG YOU. WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO? WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO? WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL BE BACK DIRECTLY,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH CRIED FROM THE NEXT ROOM. ‚ÄÚHERE I AM AGAIN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAH,‚ÄÎYOU‚ÄÔVE CHANGED YOUR COAT.‚ÄÙ SHE SCANNED HIM MOCKINGLY. (HE HAD FLUNG HIS COAT ON OVER THE DRESSING-JACKET.) ‚ÄÚWELL, CERTAINLY THAT‚ÄÔS MORE SUITED TO OUR SUBJECT. DO SIT DOWN, I ENTREAT YOU.‚ÄÙ

SHE TOLD HIM EVERYTHING AT ONCE, ABRUPTLY AND IMPRESSIVELY. SHE HINTED AT THE EIGHT THOUSAND OF WHICH HE STOOD IN SUCH TERRIBLE NEED. SHE TOLD HIM IN DETAIL OF THE DOWRY. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SAT TREMBLING, OPENING HIS EYES WIDER AND WIDER. HE HEARD IT ALL, BUT HE COULD NOT REALISE IT CLEARLY. HE TRIED TO SPEAK, BUT HIS VOICE KEPT BREAKING. ALL HE KNEW WAS THAT EVERYTHING WOULD BE AS SHE SAID, THAT TO PROTEST AND REFUSE TO AGREE WOULD BE USELESS, AND THAT HE WAS A MARRIED MAN IRREVOCABLY.

‚ÄÚMAIS, MA BONNE AMIE! ‚Ä¶ FOR THE THIRD TIME, AND AT MY AGE ‚Ä¶ AND TO SUCH A CHILD.‚ÄÙ HE BROUGHT OUT AT LAST, ‚ÄÚMAIS, C‚ÄÔEST UNE ENFANT!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚA CHILD WHO IS TWENTY YEARS OLD, THANK GOD. PLEASE DON‚ÄÔT ROLL YOUR EYES, I ENTREAT YOU, YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT ON THE STAGE. YOU‚ÄÔRE VERY CLEVER AND LEARNED, BUT YOU KNOW NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT LIFE. YOU WILL ALWAYS WANT A NURSE TO LOOK AFTER YOU. I SHALL DIE, AND WHAT WILL BECOME OF YOU? SHE WILL BE A GOOD NURSE TO YOU; SHE‚ÄÔS A MODEST GIRL, STRONG-WILLED, REASONABLE; BESIDES, I SHALL BE HERE TOO, I SHAN‚ÄÔT DIE DIRECTLY. SHE‚ÄÔS FOND OF HOME, SHE‚ÄÔS AN ANGEL OF GENTLENESS. THIS HAPPY THOUGHT CAME TO ME IN SWITZERLAND. DO YOU UNDERSTAND IF I TELL YOU MYSELF THAT SHE IS AN ANGEL OF GENTLENESS!‚ÄÙ SHE SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN FURY. ‚ÄÚYOUR HOUSE IS DIRTY, SHE WILL BRING IN ORDER, CLEANLINESS. EVERYTHING WILL SHINE LIKE A MIRROR. GOOD GRACIOUS, DO YOU EXPECT ME TO GO ON MY KNEES TO YOU WITH SUCH A TREASURE, TO ENUMERATE ALL THE ADVANTAGES, TO COURT YOU! WHY, YOU OUGHT TO BE ON YOUR KNEES.‚Ä¶ OH, YOU SHALLOW, SHALLOW, FAINT-HEARTED MAN!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔM AN OLD MAN!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOUR FIFTY-THREE YEARS MATTER! FIFTY IS THE MIDDLE OF LIFE, NOT THE END OF IT. YOU ARE A HANDSOME MAN AND YOU KNOW IT YOURSELF. YOU KNOW, TOO, WHAT A RESPECT SHE HAS FOR YOU. IF I DIE, WHAT WILL BECOME OF HER? BUT MARRIED TO YOU SHE‚ÄÔLL BE AT PEACE, AND I SHALL BE AT PEACE. YOU HAVE RENOWN, A NAME, A LOVING HEART. YOU RECEIVE A PENSION WHICH I LOOK UPON AS AN OBLIGATION. YOU WILL SAVE HER PERHAPS, YOU WILL SAVE HER! IN ANY CASE YOU WILL BE DOING HER AN HONOUR. YOU WILL FORM HER FOR LIFE, YOU WILL DEVELOP HER HEART, YOU WILL DIRECT HER IDEAS. HOW MANY PEOPLE COME TO GRIEF NOWADAYS BECAUSE THEIR IDEAS ARE WRONGLY DIRECTED. BY THAT TIME YOUR BOOK WILL BE READY, AND YOU WILL AT ONCE SET PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT YOU AGAIN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM, IN FACT,‚ÄÙ HE MUTTERED, AT ONCE FLATTERED BY VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS ADROIT INSINUATIONS. ‚ÄÚI WAS JUST PREPARING TO SIT DOWN TO MY ‚ÄÒTALES FROM SPANISH HISTORY.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, THERE YOU ARE. IT‚ÄÔS JUST COME RIGHT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT ‚Ä¶ SHE? HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO HER?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT WORRY ABOUT HER. AND THERE‚ÄÔS NO NEED FOR YOU TO BE INQUISITIVE. OF COURSE, YOU MUST ASK HER YOURSELF, ENTREAT HER TO DO YOU THE HONOUR, YOU UNDERSTAND? BUT DON‚ÄÔT BE UNEASY. I SHALL BE HERE. BESIDES, YOU LOVE HER.‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH FELT GIDDY. THE WALLS WERE GOING ROUND. THERE WAS ONE TERRIBLE IDEA UNDERLYING THIS TO WHICH HE COULD NOT RECONCILE HIMSELF.

‚ÄÚEXCELLENTE AMIE,‚ÄÙ HIS VOICE QUIVERED SUDDENLY. ‚ÄÚI COULD NEVER HAVE CONCEIVED THAT YOU WOULD MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO GIVE ME IN MARRIAGE TO ANOTHER ‚Ä¶ WOMAN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE NOT A GIRL, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. ONLY GIRLS ARE GIVEN IN MARRIAGE. YOU ARE TAKING A WIFE,‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA HISSED MALIGNANTLY.

‚ÄÚOUI, J‚ÄÔAI PRIS UN MOT POUR UN AUTRE. MAIS C‚ÄÔEST √©GAL.‚ÄÙ HE GAZED AT HER WITH A HOPELESS AIR.

‚ÄÚI SEE THAT C‚ÄÔEST √©GAL,‚ÄÙ SHE MUTTERED CONTEMPTUOUSLY THROUGH HER TEETH. ‚ÄÚGOOD HEAVENS! WHY HE‚ÄÔS GOING TO FAINT. NASTASYA, NASTASYA, WATER!‚ÄÙ

BUT WATER WAS NOT NEEDED. HE CAME TO HIMSELF. VARVARA PETROVNA TOOK UP HER UMBRELLA.

‚ÄÚI SEE IT‚ÄÔS NO USE TALKING TO YOU NOW.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOUI, OUI, JE SUIS INCAPABLE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT BY TO-MORROW YOU‚ÄÔLL HAVE RESTED AND THOUGHT IT OVER. STAY AT HOME. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS LET ME KNOW, EVEN IF IT‚ÄÔS AT NIGHT. DON‚ÄÔT WRITE LETTERS, I SHAN‚ÄÔT READ THEM. TO-MORROW I‚ÄÔLL COME AGAIN AT THIS TIME ALONE, FOR A FINAL ANSWER, AND I TRUST IT WILL BE SATISFACTORY. TRY TO HAVE NOBODY HERE AND NO UNTIDINESS, FOR THE PLACE ISN‚ÄÔT FIT TO BE SEEN. NASTASYA, NASTASYA!‚ÄÙ

THE NEXT DAY, OF COURSE, HE CONSENTED, AND, INDEED, HE COULD DO NOTHING ELSE. THERE WAS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE ‚Ä¶

VIII

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS ESTATE, AS WE USED TO CALL IT (WHICH CONSISTED OF FIFTY SOULS, RECKONING IN THE OLD FASHION, AND BORDERED ON SKVORESHNIKI), WAS NOT REALLY HIS AT ALL, BUT HIS FIRST WIFE‚ÄÔS, AND SO BELONGED NOW TO HIS SON PYOTR STEPANOVITCH VERHOVENSKY. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS SIMPLY HIS TRUSTEE, AND SO, WHEN THE NESTLING WAS FULL-FLEDGED, HE HAD GIVEN HIS FATHER A FORMAL AUTHORISATION TO MANAGE THE ESTATE. THIS TRANSACTION WAS A PROFITABLE ONE FOR THE YOUNG MAN. HE RECEIVED AS MUCH AS A THOUSAND ROUBLES A YEAR BY WAY OF REVENUE FROM THE ESTATE, THOUGH UNDER THE NEW REGIME IT COULD NOT HAVE YIELDED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED, AND POSSIBLY NOT THAT. GOD KNOWS HOW SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT HAD ARISEN. THE WHOLE SUM, HOWEVER, WAS SENT THE YOUNG MAN BY VARVARA PETROVNA, AND STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH A SINGLE ROUBLE OF IT. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE WHOLE REVENUE FROM THE LAND REMAINED IN HIS POCKET, AND HE HAD, BESIDES, COMPLETELY RUINED THE ESTATE, LETTING IT TO A MERCENARY ROGUE, AND WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF VARVARA PETROVNA SELLING THE TIMBER WHICH GAVE THE ESTATE ITS CHIEF VALUE. HE HAD SOME TIME BEFORE SOLD THE WOODS BIT BY BIT. IT WAS WORTH AT LEAST EIGHT THOUSAND, YET HE HAD ONLY RECEIVED FIVE THOUSAND FOR IT. BUT HE SOMETIMES LOST TOO MUCH AT THE CLUB, AND WAS AFRAID TO ASK VARVARA PETROVNA FOR THE MONEY. SHE CLENCHED HER TEETH WHEN SHE HEARD AT LAST OF EVERYTHING. AND NOW, ALL AT ONCE, HIS SON ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS COMING HIMSELF TO SELL HIS PROPERTY FOR WHAT HE COULD GET FOR IT, AND COMMISSIONED HIS FATHER TO TAKE STEPS PROMPTLY TO ARRANGE THE SALE. IT WAS CLEAR THAT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, BEING A GENEROUS AND DISINTERESTED MAN, FELT ASHAMED OF HIS TREATMENT OF CE CHER ENFANT (WHOM HE HAD SEEN FOR THE LAST TIME NINE YEARS BEFORE AS A STUDENT IN PETERSBURG). THE ESTATE MIGHT ORIGINALLY HAVE BEEN WORTH THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN THOUSAND. NOW IT WAS DOUBTFUL WHETHER ANYONE WOULD GIVE FIVE FOR IT. NO DOUBT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS FULLY ENTITLED BY THE TERMS OF THE TRUST TO SELL THE WOOD, AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE INCREDIBLY LARGE YEARLY REVENUE OF A THOUSAND ROUBLES WHICH HAD BEEN SENT PUNCTUALLY FOR SO MANY YEARS, HE COULD HAVE PUT UP A GOOD DEFENCE OF HIS MANAGEMENT. BUT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS A GENEROUS MAN OF EXALTED IMPULSES. A WONDERFULLY FINE INSPIRATION OCCURRED TO HIS MIND: WHEN PETRUSHA RETURNED, TO LAY ON THE TABLE BEFORE HIM THE MAXIMUM PRICE OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND ROUBLES WITHOUT A HINT AT THE SUMS THAT HAD BEEN SENT HIM HITHERTO, AND WARMLY AND WITH TEARS TO PRESS CE CHER FILS TO HIS HEART, AND SO TO MAKE AN END OF ALL ACCOUNTS BETWEEN THEM. HE BEGAN CAUTIOUSLY AND INDIRECTLY UNFOLDING THIS PICTURE BEFORE VARVARA PETROVNA. HE HINTED THAT THIS WOULD ADD A PECULIARLY NOBLE NOTE TO THEIR FRIENDSHIP ‚Ä¶ TO THEIR ‚ÄÚIDEA.‚ÄÙ THIS WOULD SET THE PARENTS OF THE LAST GENERATION‚ÄÎAND PEOPLE OF THE LAST GENERATION GENERALLY‚ÄÎIN SUCH A DISINTERESTED AND MAGNANIMOUS LIGHT IN COMPARISON WITH THE NEW FRIVOLOUS AND SOCIALISTIC YOUNGER GENERATION. HE SAID A GREAT DEAL MORE, BUT VARVARA PETROVNA WAS OBSTINATELY SILENT. AT LAST SHE INFORMED HIM AIRILY THAT SHE WAS PREPARED TO BUY THEIR ESTATE, AND TO PAY FOR IT THE MAXIMUM PRICE, THAT IS, SIX OR SEVEN THOUSAND (THOUGH FOUR WOULD HAVE BEEN A FAIR PRICE FOR IT). OF THE REMAINING EIGHT THOUSAND WHICH HAD VANISHED WITH THE WOODS SHE SAID NOT A WORD.

THIS CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE A MONTH BEFORE THE MATCH WAS PROPOSED TO HIM. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS OVERWHELMED, AND BEGAN TO PONDER. THERE MIGHT IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN A HOPE THAT HIS SON WOULD NOT COME, AFTER ALL‚ÄÎAN OUTSIDER, THAT IS TO SAY, MIGHT HAVE HOPED SO. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH AS A FATHER WOULD HAVE INDIGNANTLY REJECTED THE INSINUATION THAT HE COULD ENTERTAIN SUCH A HOPE. ANYWAY QUEER RUMOURS HAD HITHERTO BEEN REACHING US ABOUT PETRUSHA. TO BEGIN WITH, ON COMPLETING HIS STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY SIX YEARS BEFORE, HE HAD HUNG ABOUT IN PETERSBURG WITHOUT GETTING WORK. SUDDENLY WE GOT THE NEWS THAT HE HAD TAKEN PART IN ISSUING SOME ANONYMOUS MANIFESTO AND THAT HE WAS IMPLICATED IN THE AFFAIR. THEN HE SUDDENLY TURNED UP ABROAD IN SWITZERLAND AT GENEVA‚ÄÎHE HAD ESCAPED, VERY LIKELY.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS SURPRISING TO ME,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH COMMENTED, GREATLY DISCONCERTED. ‚ÄÚPETRUSHA, C‚ÄÔEST UNE SI PAUVRE T√™TE! HE‚ÄÔS GOOD, NOBLE-HEARTED, VERY SENSITIVE, AND I WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIM IN PETERSBURG, COMPARING HIM WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF TO-DAY. BUT C‚ÄÔEST UN PAUVRE SIRE, TOUT DE M√™ME.‚Ä¶ AND YOU KNOW IT ALL COMES FROM THAT SAME HALF-BAKEDNESS, THAT SENTIMENTALITY. THEY ARE FASCINATED, NOT BY REALISM, BUT BY THE EMOTIONAL IDEAL SIDE OF SOCIALISM, BY THE RELIGIOUS NOTE IN IT, SO TO SAY, BY THE POETRY OF IT ‚Ä¶ SECOND-HAND, OF COURSE. AND FOR ME, FOR ME, THINK WHAT IT MEANS! I HAVE SO MANY ENEMIES HERE AND MORE STILL THERE, THEY‚ÄÔLL PUT IT DOWN TO THE FATHER‚ÄÔS INFLUENCE. GOOD GOD! PETRUSHA A REVOLUTIONIST! WHAT TIMES WE LIVE IN!‚ÄÙ

VERY SOON, HOWEVER, PETRUSHA SENT HIS EXACT ADDRESS FROM SWITZERLAND FOR MONEY TO BE SENT HIM AS USUAL; SO HE COULD NOT BE EXACTLY AN EXILE. AND NOW, AFTER FOUR YEARS ABROAD, HE WAS SUDDENLY MAKING HIS APPEARANCE AGAIN IN HIS OWN COUNTRY, AND ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD ARRIVE SHORTLY, SO THERE COULD BE NO CHARGE AGAINST HIM. WHAT WAS MORE, SOMEONE SEEMED TO BE INTERESTED IN HIM AND PROTECTING HIM. HE WROTE NOW FROM THE SOUTH OF RUSSIA, WHERE HE WAS BUSILY ENGAGED IN SOME PRIVATE BUT IMPORTANT BUSINESS. ALL THIS WAS CAPITAL, BUT WHERE WAS HIS FATHER TO GET THAT OTHER SEVEN OR EIGHT THOUSAND, TO MAKE UP A SUITABLE PRICE FOR THE ESTATE? AND WHAT IF THERE SHOULD BE AN OUTCRY, AND INSTEAD OF THAT IMPOSING PICTURE IT SHOULD COME TO A LAWSUIT? SOMETHING TOLD STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH THAT THE SENSITIVE PETRUSHA WOULD NOT RELINQUISH ANYTHING THAT WAS TO HIS INTEREST. ‚ÄÚWHY IS IT‚ÄÎAS I‚ÄÔVE NOTICED,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WHISPERED TO ME ONCE, ‚ÄÚWHY IS IT THAT ALL THESE DESPERATE SOCIALISTS AND COMMUNISTS ARE AT THE SAME TIME SUCH INCREDIBLE SKINFLINTS, SO AVARICIOUS, SO KEEN OVER PROPERTY, AND, IN FACT, THE MORE SOCIALISTIC, THE MORE EXTREME THEY ARE, THE KEENER THEY ARE OVER PROPERTY ‚Ä¶ WHY IS IT? CAN THAT, TOO, COME FROM SENTIMENTALISM?‚ÄÙ I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHETHER THERE IS ANY TRUTH IN THIS OBSERVATION OF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS. I ONLY KNOW THAT PETRUSHA HAD SOMEHOW GOT WIND OF THE SALE OF THE WOODS AND THE REST OF IT, AND THAT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS AWARE OF THE FACT. I HAPPENED, TOO, TO READ SOME OF PETRUSHA‚ÄÔS LETTERS TO HIS FATHER. HE WROTE EXTREMELY RARELY, ONCE A YEAR, OR EVEN LESS OFTEN. ONLY RECENTLY, TO INFORM HIM OF HIS APPROACHING VISIT, HE HAD SENT TWO LETTERS, ONE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OTHER. ALL HIS LETTERS WERE SHORT, DRY, CONSISTING ONLY OF INSTRUCTIONS, AND AS THE FATHER AND SON HAD, SINCE THEIR MEETING IN PETERSBURG, ADOPTED THE FASHIONABLE ‚ÄÚTHOU‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚTHEE,‚ÄÙ PETRUSHA‚ÄÔS LETTERS HAD A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO THE MISSIVES THAT USED TO BE SENT BY LANDOWNERS OF THE OLD SCHOOL FROM THE TOWN TO THEIR SERFS WHOM THEY HAD LEFT IN CHARGE OF THEIR ESTATES. AND NOW SUDDENLY THIS EIGHT THOUSAND WHICH WOULD SOLVE THE DIFFICULTY WOULD BE WAFTED TO HIM BY VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS PROPOSITION. AND AT THE SAME TIME SHE MADE HIM DISTINCTLY FEEL THAT IT NEVER COULD BE WAFTED TO HIM FROM ANYWHERE ELSE. OF COURSE STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH CONSENTED.

HE SENT FOR ME DIRECTLY SHE HAD GONE AND SHUT HIMSELF UP FOR THE WHOLE DAY, ADMITTING NO ONE ELSE. HE CRIED, OF COURSE, TALKED WELL AND TALKED A GREAT DEAL, CONTRADICTED HIMSELF CONTINUALLY, MADE A CASUAL PUN, AND WAS MUCH PLEASED WITH IT. THEN HE HAD A SLIGHT ATTACK OF HIS ‚ÄÚSUMMER CHOLERA‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎEVERYTHING IN FACT FOLLOWED THE USUAL COURSE. THEN HE BROUGHT OUT THE PORTRAIT OF HIS GERMAN BRIDE, NOW TWENTY YEARS DECEASED, AND BEGAN PLAINTIVELY APPEALING TO HER: ‚ÄÚWILL YOU FORGIVE ME?‚ÄÙ IN FACT HE SEEMED SOMEHOW DISTRACTED. OUR GRIEF LED US TO GET A LITTLE DRUNK. HE SOON FELL INTO A SWEET SLEEP, HOWEVER. NEXT MORNING HE TIED HIS CRAVAT IN MASTERLY FASHION, DRESSED WITH CARE, AND WENT FREQUENTLY TO LOOK AT HIMSELF IN THE GLASS. HE SPRINKLED HIS HANDKERCHIEF WITH SCENT, ONLY A SLIGHT DASH OF IT, HOWEVER, AND AS SOON AS HE SAW VARVARA PETROVNA OUT OF THE WINDOW HE HURRIEDLY TOOK ANOTHER HANDKERCHIEF AND HID THE SCENTED ONE UNDER THE PILLOW.

‚ÄÚEXCELLENT!‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA APPROVED, ON RECEIVING HIS CONSENT. ‚ÄÚIN THE FIRST PLACE YOU SHOW A FINE DECISION, AND SECONDLY YOU‚ÄÔVE LISTENED TO THE VOICE OF REASON, TO WHICH YOU GENERALLY PAY SO LITTLE HEED IN YOUR PRIVATE AFFAIRS. THERE‚ÄÔS NO NEED OF HASTE, HOWEVER,‚ÄÙ SHE ADDED, SCANNING THE KNOT OF HIS WHITE TIE, ‚ÄÚFOR THE PRESENT SAY NOTHING, AND I WILL SAY NOTHING. IT WILL SOON BE YOUR BIRTHDAY; I WILL COME TO SEE YOU WITH HER. GIVE US TEA IN THE EVENING, AND PLEASE WITHOUT WINE OR OTHER REFRESHMENTS, BUT I‚ÄÔLL ARRANGE IT ALL MYSELF. INVITE YOUR FRIENDS, BUT WE‚ÄÔLL MAKE THE LIST TOGETHER. YOU CAN TALK TO HER THE DAY BEFORE, IF NECESSARY. AND AT YOUR PARTY WE WON‚ÄÔT EXACTLY ANNOUNCE IT, OR MAKE AN ENGAGEMENT OF ANY SORT, BUT ONLY HINT AT IT, AND LET PEOPLE KNOW WITHOUT ANY SORT OF CEREMONY. AND THEN THE WEDDING A FORTNIGHT LATER, AS FAR AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ANY FUSS.‚Ä¶ YOU TWO MIGHT EVEN GO AWAY FOR A TIME AFTER THE WEDDING, TO MOSCOW, FOR INSTANCE. I‚ÄÔLL GO WITH YOU, TOO, PERHAPS ‚Ä¶ THE CHIEF THING IS, KEEP QUIET TILL THEN.‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS SURPRISED. HE TRIED TO FALTER THAT HE COULD NOT DO LIKE THAT, THAT HE MUST TALK IT OVER WITH HIS BRIDE. BUT VARVARA PETROVNA FLEW AT HIM IN EXASPERATION.

‚ÄÚWHAT FOR? IN THE FIRST PLACE IT MAY PERHAPS COME TO NOTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCOME TO NOTHING!‚ÄÙ MUTTERED THE BRIDEGROOM, UTTERLY DUMBFOUNDERED.

‚ÄÚYES. I‚ÄÔLL SEE.‚Ä¶ BUT EVERYTHING SHALL BE AS I‚ÄÔVE TOLD YOU, AND DON‚ÄÔT BE UNEASY. I‚ÄÔLL PREPARE HER MYSELF. THERE‚ÄÔS REALLY NO NEED FOR YOU. EVERYTHING NECESSARY SHALL BE SAID AND DONE, AND THERE‚ÄÔS NO NEED FOR YOU TO MEDDLE. WHY SHOULD YOU? IN WHAT CHARACTER? DON‚ÄÔT COME AND DON‚ÄÔT WRITE LETTERS. AND NOT A SIGHT OR SOUND OF YOU, I BEG. I WILL BE SILENT TOO.‚ÄÙ

SHE ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO EXPLAIN HERSELF, AND WENT AWAY, OBVIOUSLY UPSET. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS EXCESSIVE READINESS EVIDENTLY IMPRESSED HER. ALAS! HE WAS UTTERLY UNABLE TO GRASP HIS POSITION, AND THE QUESTION HAD NOT YET PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM FROM CERTAIN OTHER POINTS OF VIEW. ON THE CONTRARY A NEW NOTE WAS APPARENT IN HIM, A SORT OF CONQUERING AND JAUNTY AIR. HE SWAGGERED.

‚ÄÚI DO LIKE THAT!‚ÄÙ HE EXCLAIMED, STANDING BEFORE ME, AND FLINGING WIDE HIS ARMS. ‚ÄÚDID YOU HEAR? SHE WANTS TO DRIVE ME TO REFUSING AT LAST. WHY, I MAY LOSE PATIENCE, TOO, AND ‚Ä¶ REFUSE! ‚ÄÒSIT STILL, THERE‚ÄÔS NO NEED FOR YOU TO GO TO HER.‚ÄÔ BUT AFTER ALL, WHY SHOULD I BE MARRIED? SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE‚ÄÔS TAKEN AN ABSURD FANCY INTO HER HEART. BUT I‚ÄÔM A SERIOUS MAN, AND I CAN REFUSE TO SUBMIT TO THE IDLE WHIMS OF A GIDDY-WOMAN! I HAVE DUTIES TO MY SON AND ‚Ä¶ AND TO MYSELF! I‚ÄÔM MAKING A SACRIFICE. DOES SHE REALISE THAT? I HAVE AGREED, PERHAPS, BECAUSE I AM WEARY OF LIFE AND NOTHING MATTERS TO ME. BUT SHE MAY EXASPERATE ME, AND THEN IT WILL MATTER. I SHALL RESENT IT AND REFUSE. ET ENFIN, LE RIDICULE ‚Ä¶ WHAT WILL THEY SAY AT THE CLUB? WHAT WILL ‚Ä¶ WHAT WILL ‚Ä¶ LAPUTIN SAY? ‚ÄÒPERHAPS NOTHING WILL COME OF IT‚ÄÔ‚ÄÎWHAT A THING TO SAY! THAT BEATS EVERYTHING. THAT‚ÄÔS REALLY ‚Ä¶ WHAT IS ONE TO SAY TO THAT?‚Ä¶ JE SUIS UN FOR√ßAT, UN BADINGUET, UN MAN PUSHED TO THE WALL.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

AND AT THE SAME TIME A SORT OF CAPRICIOUS COMPLACENCY, SOMETHING FRIVOLOUS AND PLAYFUL, COULD BE SEEN IN THE MIDST OF ALL THESE PLAINTIVE EXCLAMATIONS. IN THE EVENING WE DRANK TOO MUCH AGAIN.





CHAPTER III. THE SINS OF OTHERS

I

ABOUT A WEEK HAD PASSED, AND THE POSITION HAD BEGUN TO GROW MORE COMPLICATED.

I MAY MENTION IN PASSING THAT I SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL DURING THAT UNHAPPY WEEK, AS I SCARCELY LEFT THE SIDE OF MY AFFIANCED FRIEND, IN THE CAPACITY OF HIS MOST INTIMATE CONFIDANT. WHAT WEIGHED UPON HIM MOST WAS THE FEELING OF SHAME, THOUGH WE SAW NO ONE ALL THAT WEEK, AND SAT INDOORS ALONE. BUT HE WAS EVEN ASHAMED BEFORE ME, AND SO MUCH SO THAT THE MORE HE CONFIDED TO ME THE MORE VEXED HE WAS WITH ME FOR IT. HE WAS SO MORBIDLY APPREHENSIVE THAT HE EXPECTED THAT EVERY ONE KNEW ABOUT IT ALREADY, THE WHOLE TOWN, AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOW HIMSELF, NOT ONLY AT THE CLUB, BUT EVEN IN HIS CIRCLE OF FRIENDS. HE POSITIVELY WOULD NOT GO OUT TO TAKE HIS CONSTITUTIONAL TILL WELL AFTER DUSK, WHEN IT WAS QUITE DARK.

A WEEK PASSED AND HE STILL DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HE WERE BETROTHED OR NOT, AND COULD NOT FIND OUT FOR A FACT, HOWEVER MUCH HE TRIED. HE HAD NOT YET SEEN HIS FUTURE BRIDE, AND DID NOT KNOW WHETHER SHE WAS TO BE HIS BRIDE OR NOT; DID NOT, IN FACT, KNOW WHETHER THERE WAS ANYTHING SERIOUS IN IT AT ALL. VARVARA PETROVNA, FOR SOME REASON, RESOLUTELY REFUSED TO ADMIT HIM TO HER PRESENCE. IN ANSWER TO ONE OF HIS FIRST LETTERS TO HER (AND HE WROTE A GREAT NUMBER OF THEM) SHE BEGGED HIM PLAINLY TO SPARE HER ALL COMMUNICATIONS WITH HIM FOR A TIME, BECAUSE SHE WAS VERY BUSY, AND HAVING A GREAT DEAL OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO COMMUNICATE TO HIM SHE WAS WAITING FOR A MORE FREE MOMENT TO DO SO, AND THAT SHE WOULD LET HIM KNOW IN TIME WHEN HE COULD COME TO SEE HER. SHE DECLARED SHE WOULD SEND BACK HIS LETTERS UNOPENED, AS THEY WERE ‚ÄÚSIMPLE SELF-INDULGENCE.‚ÄÙ I READ THAT LETTER MYSELF‚ÄÎHE SHOWED IT ME.

YET ALL THIS HARSHNESS AND INDEFINITENESS WERE NOTHING COMPARED WITH HIS CHIEF ANXIETY. THAT ANXIETY TORMENTED HIM TO THE UTMOST AND WITHOUT CEASING. HE GREW THIN AND DISPIRITED THROUGH IT. IT WAS SOMETHING OF WHICH HE WAS MORE ASHAMED THAN OF ANYTHING ELSE, AND OF WHICH HE WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT SPEAK, EVEN TO ME; ON THE CONTRARY, HE LIED ON OCCASION, AND SHUFFLED BEFORE ME LIKE A LITTLE BOY; AND AT THE SAME TIME HE SENT FOR ME HIMSELF EVERY DAY, COULD NOT STAY TWO HOURS WITHOUT ME, NEEDING ME AS MUCH AS AIR OR WATER.

SUCH CONDUCT RATHER WOUNDED MY VANITY. I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT I HAD LONG AGO PRIVATELY GUESSED THIS GREAT SECRET OF HIS, AND SAW THROUGH IT COMPLETELY. IT WAS MY FIRMEST CONVICTION AT THE TIME THAT THE REVELATION OF THIS SECRET, THIS CHIEF ANXIETY OF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS WOULD NOT HAVE REDOUNDED TO HIS CREDIT, AND, THEREFORE, AS I WAS STILL YOUNG, I WAS RATHER INDIGNANT AT THE COARSENESS OF HIS FEELINGS AND THE UGLINESS OF SOME OF HIS SUSPICIONS. IN MY WARMTH‚ÄÎAND, I MUST CONFESS, IN MY WEARINESS OF BEING HIS CONFIDANT‚ÄÎI PERHAPS BLAMED HIM TOO MUCH. I WAS SO CRUEL AS TO TRY AND FORCE HIM TO CONFESS IT ALL TO ME HIMSELF, THOUGH I DID RECOGNISE THAT IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO CONFESS SOME THINGS. HE, TOO, SAW THROUGH ME; THAT IS, HE CLEARLY PERCEIVED THAT I SAW THROUGH HIM, AND THAT I WAS ANGRY WITH HIM INDEED, AND HE WAS ANGRY WITH ME TOO FOR BEING ANGRY WITH HIM AND SEEING THROUGH HIM. MY IRRITATION WAS PERHAPS PETTY AND STUPID; BUT THE UNRELIEVED SOLITUDE OF TWO FRIENDS TOGETHER IS SOMETIMES EXTREMELY PREJUDICIAL TO TRUE FRIENDSHIP. FROM A CERTAIN POINT OF VIEW HE HAD A VERY TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF SOME ASPECTS OF HIS POSITION, AND DEFINED IT, INDEED, VERY SUBTLY ON THOSE POINTS ABOUT WHICH HE DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO BE SECRET.

‚ÄÚOH, HOW DIFFERENT SHE WAS THEN!‚ÄÙ HE WOULD SOMETIMES SAY TO ME ABOUT VARVARA PETROVNA. ‚ÄÚHOW DIFFERENT SHE WAS IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN WE USED TO TALK TOGETHER.‚Ä¶ DO YOU KNOW THAT SHE COULD TALK IN THOSE DAYS! CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT SHE HAD IDEAS IN THOSE DAYS, ORIGINAL IDEAS! NOW, EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED! SHE SAYS ALL THAT‚ÄÔS ONLY OLD-FASHIONED TWADDLE. SHE DESPISES THE PAST.‚Ä¶ NOW SHE‚ÄÔS LIKE SOME SHOPMAN OR CASHIER, SHE HAS GROWN HARD-HEARTED, AND SHE‚ÄÔS ALWAYS CROSS.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY IS SHE CROSS NOW IF YOU ARE CARRYING OUT HER ORDERS?‚ÄÙ I ANSWERED.

HE LOOKED AT ME SUBTLY.

‚ÄÚCHER AMI; IF I HAD NOT AGREED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN DREADFULLY ANGRY, DREAD-FUL-LY! BUT YET LESS THAN NOW THAT I HAVE CONSENTED.‚ÄÙ

HE WAS PLEASED WITH THIS SAYING OF HIS, AND WE EMPTIED A BOTTLE BETWEEN US THAT EVENING. BUT THAT WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT, NEXT DAY HE WAS WORSE AND MORE ILL-HUMOURED THAN EVER.

BUT WHAT I WAS MOST VEXED WITH HIM FOR WAS THAT HE COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO CALL ON THE DROZDOVS, AS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE ON THEIR ARRIVAL, TO RENEW THE ACQUAINTANCE OF WHICH, SO WE HEARD THEY WERE THEMSELVES DESIROUS, SINCE THEY KEPT ASKING ABOUT HIM. IT WAS A SOURCE OF DAILY DISTRESS TO HIM. HE TALKED OF LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA WITH AN ECSTASY WHICH I WAS AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND. NO DOUBT HE REMEMBERED IN HER THE CHILD WHOM HE HAD ONCE LOVED. BUT BESIDES THAT, HE IMAGINED FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON THAT HE WOULD AT ONCE FIND IN HER COMPANY A SOLACE FOR HIS PRESENT MISERY, AND EVEN THE SOLUTION OF HIS MORE SERIOUS DOUBTS. HE EXPECTED TO MEET IN LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA AN EXTRAORDINARY BEING. AND YET HE DID NOT GO TO SEE HER THOUGH HE MEANT TO DO SO EVERY DAY. THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT I WAS DESPERATELY ANXIOUS TO BE PRESENTED TO HER AND TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE, AND I COULD LOOK TO NO ONE BUT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH TO EFFECT THIS. I WAS FREQUENTLY MEETING HER, IN THE STREET OF COURSE, WHEN SHE WAS OUT RIDING, WEARING A RIDING-HABIT AND MOUNTED ON A FINE HORSE, AND ACCOMPANIED BY HER COUSIN, SO-CALLED, A HANDSOME OFFICER, THE NEPHEW OF THE LATE GENERAL DROZDOV‚ÄÎAND THESE MEETINGS MADE AN EXTRAORDINARY IMPRESSION ON ME AT THE TIME. MY INFATUATION LASTED ONLY A MOMENT, AND I VERY SOON AFTERWARDS RECOGNISED THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF MY DREAMS MYSELF‚ÄÎBUT THOUGH IT WAS A FLEETING IMPRESSION IT WAS A VERY REAL ONE, AND SO IT MAY WELL BE IMAGINED HOW INDIGNANT I WAS AT THE TIME WITH MY POOR FRIEND FOR KEEPING SO OBSTINATELY SECLUDED.

ALL THE MEMBERS OF OUR CIRCLE HAD BEEN OFFICIALLY INFORMED FROM THE BEGINNING THAT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WOULD SEE NOBODY FOR A TIME, AND BEGGED THEM TO LEAVE HIM QUITE ALONE. HE INSISTED ON SENDING ROUND A CIRCULAR NOTICE TO THIS EFFECT, THOUGH I TRIED TO DISSUADE HIM. I WENT ROUND TO EVERY ONE AT HIS REQUEST AND TOLD EVERYBODY THAT VARVARA PETROVNA HAD GIVEN ‚ÄÚOUR OLD MAN‚ÄÙ (AS WE ALL USED TO CALL STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH AMONG OURSELVES) A SPECIAL JOB, TO ARRANGE IN ORDER SOME CORRESPONDENCE LASTING OVER MANY YEARS; THAT HE HAD SHUT HIMSELF UP TO DO IT AND I WAS HELPING HIM. LIPUTIN WAS THE ONLY ONE I DID NOT HAVE TIME TO VISIT, AND I KEPT PUTTING IT OFF‚ÄÎTO TELL THE REAL TRUTH I WAS AFRAID TO GO TO HIM. I KNEW BEFOREHAND THAT HE WOULD NOT BELIEVE ONE WORD OF MY STORY, THAT HE WOULD CERTAINLY IMAGINE THAT THERE WAS SOME SECRET AT THE BOTTOM OF IT, WHICH THEY WERE TRYING TO HIDE FROM HIM ALONE, AND AS SOON AS I LEFT HIM HE WOULD SET TO WORK TO MAKE INQUIRIES AND GOSSIP ALL OVER THE TOWN. WHILE I WAS PICTURING ALL THIS TO MYSELF I HAPPENED TO RUN ACROSS HIM IN THE STREET. IT TURNED OUT THAT HE HAD HEARD ALL ABOUT IT FROM OUR FRIENDS, WHOM I HAD ONLY JUST INFORMED. BUT, STRANGE TO SAY, INSTEAD OF BEING INQUISITIVE AND ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, HE INTERRUPTED ME, WHEN I BEGAN APOLOGISING FOR NOT HAVING COME TO HIM BEFORE, AND AT ONCE PASSED TO OTHER SUBJECTS. IT IS TRUE THAT HE HAD A GREAT DEAL STORED UP TO TELL ME. HE WAS IN A STATE OF GREAT EXCITEMENT, AND WAS DELIGHTED TO HAVE GOT HOLD OF ME FOR A LISTENER. HE BEGAN TALKING OF THE NEWS OF THE TOWN, OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE, ‚ÄÚWITH NEW TOPICS OF CONVERSATION,‚ÄÙ OF AN OPPOSITION PARTY ALREADY FORMED IN THE CLUB, OF HOW THEY WERE ALL IN A HUBBUB OVER THE NEW IDEAS, AND HOW CHARMINGLY THIS SUITED HIM, AND SO ON. HE TALKED FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND SO AMUSINGLY THAT I COULD NOT TEAR MYSELF AWAY. THOUGH I COULD NOT ENDURE HIM, YET I MUST ADMIT HE HAD THE GIFT OF MAKING ONE LISTEN TO HIM, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE WAS VERY ANGRY AT SOMETHING. THIS MAN WAS, IN MY OPINION, A REGULAR SPY FROM HIS VERY NATURE. AT EVERY MOMENT HE KNEW THE VERY LATEST GOSSIP AND ALL THE TRIFLING INCIDENTS OF OUR TOWN, ESPECIALLY THE UNPLEASANT ONES, AND IT WAS SURPRISING TO ME HOW HE TOOK THINGS TO HEART THAT WERE SOMETIMES ABSOLUTELY NO CONCERN OF HIS. IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THAT THE LEADING FEATURE OF HIS CHARACTER WAS ENVY. WHEN I TOLD STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH THE SAME EVENING OF MY MEETING LIPUTIN THAT MORNING AND OUR CONVERSATION, THE LATTER TO MY AMAZEMENT BECAME GREATLY AGITATED, AND ASKED ME THE WILD QUESTION: ‚ÄÚDOES LIPUTIN KNOW OR NOT?‚ÄÙ

I BEGAN TRYING TO PROVE THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF HIS FINDING IT OUT SO SOON, AND THAT THERE WAS NOBODY FROM WHOM HE COULD HEAR IT. BUT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN. ‚ÄÚWELL, YOU MAY BELIEVE IT OR NOT,‚ÄÙ HE CONCLUDED UNEXPECTEDLY AT LAST, ‚ÄÚBUT I‚ÄÔM CONVINCED THAT HE NOT ONLY KNOWS EVERY DETAIL OF ‚ÄÒOUR‚ÄÔ POSITION, BUT THAT HE KNOWS SOMETHING ELSE BESIDES, SOMETHING NEITHER YOU NOR I KNOW YET, AND PERHAPS NEVER SHALL, OR SHALL ONLY KNOW WHEN IT‚ÄÔS TOO LATE, WHEN THERE‚ÄÔS NO TURNING BACK!‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

I SAID NOTHING, BUT THESE WORDS SUGGESTED A GREAT DEAL. FOR FIVE WHOLE DAYS AFTER THAT WE DID NOT SAY ONE WORD ABOUT LIPUTIN; IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH GREATLY REGRETTED HAVING LET HIS TONGUE RUN AWAY WITH HIM, AND HAVING REVEALED SUCH SUSPICIONS BEFORE ME.

II

ONE MORNING, ON THE SEVENTH OR EIGHTH DAY AFTER STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HAD CONSENTED TO BECOME ‚ÄÚENGAGED,‚ÄÙ ABOUT ELEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK, WHEN I WAS HURRYING AS USUAL TO MY AFFLICTED FRIEND, I HAD AN ADVENTURE ON THE WAY.

I MET KARMAZINOV, ‚ÄÚTHE GREAT WRITER,‚ÄÙ AS LIPUTIN CALLED HIM. I HAD READ KARMAZINOV FROM A CHILD. HIS NOVELS AND TALES WERE WELL KNOWN TO THE PAST AND EVEN TO THE PRESENT GENERATION. I REVELLED IN THEM; THEY WERE THE GREAT ENJOYMENT OF MY CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH. AFTERWARDS I GREW RATHER LESS ENTHUSIASTIC OVER HIS WORK. I DID NOT CARE SO MUCH FOR THE NOVELS WITH A PURPOSE WHICH HE HAD BEEN WRITING OF LATE AS FOR HIS FIRST, EARLY WORKS, WHICH WERE SO FULL OF SPONTANEOUS POETRY, AND HIS LATEST PUBLICATIONS I HAD NOT LIKED AT ALL. SPEAKING GENERALLY, IF I MAY VENTURE TO EXPRESS MY OPINION ON SO DELICATE A SUBJECT, ALL THESE TALENTED GENTLEMEN OF THE MIDDLING SORT WHO ARE SOMETIMES IN THEIR LIFETIME ACCEPTED ALMOST AS GENIUSES, PASS OUT OF MEMORY QUITE SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT A TRACE WHEN THEY DIE, AND WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT EVEN DURING THEIR LIFETIME, AS SOON AS A NEW GENERATION GROWS UP AND TAKES THE PLACE OF THE ONE IN WHICH THEY HAVE FLOURISHED, THEY ARE FORGOTTEN AND NEGLECTED BY EVERY ONE IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT TIME. THIS SOMEHOW HAPPENS AMONG US QUITE SUDDENLY, LIKE THE SHIFTING OF THE SCENES ON THE STAGE. OH, IT‚ÄÔS NOT AT ALL THE SAME AS WITH PUSHKIN, GOGOL, MOLI√®RE, VOLTAIRE, ALL THOSE GREAT MEN WHO REALLY HAD A NEW ORIGINAL WORD TO SAY! IT‚ÄÔS TRUE, TOO, THAT THESE TALENTED GENTLEMEN OF THE MIDDLING SORT IN THE DECLINE OF THEIR VENERABLE YEARS USUALLY WRITE THEMSELVES OUT IN THE MOST PITIFUL WAY, THOUGH THEY DON‚ÄÔT OBSERVE THE FACT THEMSELVES. IT HAPPENS NOT INFREQUENTLY THAT A WRITER WHO HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME CREDITED WITH EXTRAORDINARY PROFUNDITY AND EXPECTED TO EXERCISE A GREAT AND SERIOUS INFLUENCE ON THE PROGRESS OF SOCIETY, BETRAYS IN THE END SUCH POVERTY, SUCH INSIPIDITY IN HIS FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS THAT NO ONE REGRETS THAT HE SUCCEEDED IN WRITING HIMSELF OUT SO SOON. BUT THE OLD GREY-BEARDS DON‚ÄÔT NOTICE THIS, AND ARE ANGRY. THEIR VANITY SOMETIMES, ESPECIALLY TOWARDS THE END OF THEIR CAREER, REACHES PROPORTIONS THAT MAY WELL PROVOKE WONDER. GOD KNOWS WHAT THEY BEGIN TO TAKE THEMSELVES FOR‚ÄÎFOR GODS AT LEAST! PEOPLE USED TO SAY ABOUT KARMAZINOV THAT HIS CONNECTIONS WITH ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY AND POWERFUL PERSONAGES WERE DEARER TO HIM THAN HIS OWN SOUL, PEOPLE USED TO SAY THAT ON MEETING YOU HE WOULD BE CORDIAL, THAT HE WOULD FASCINATE AND ENCHANT YOU WITH HIS OPEN-HEARTEDNESS, ESPECIALLY IF YOU WERE OF USE TO HIM IN SOME WAY, AND IF YOU CAME TO HIM WITH SOME PRELIMINARY RECOMMENDATION. BUT THAT BEFORE ANY STRAY PRINCE, ANY STRAY COUNTESS, ANYONE THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF, HE WOULD REGARD IT AS HIS SACRED DUTY TO FORGET YOUR EXISTENCE WITH THE MOST INSULTING CARELESSNESS, LIKE A CHIP OF WOOD, LIKE A FLY, BEFORE YOU HAD EVEN TIME TO GET OUT OF HIS SIGHT; HE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED THIS THE BEST AND MOST ARISTOCRATIC STYLE. IN SPITE OF THE BEST OF BREEDING AND PERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD MANNERS HE IS, THEY SAY, VAIN TO SUCH AN HYSTERICAL PITCH THAT HE CANNOT CONCEAL HIS IRRITABILITY AS AN AUTHOR EVEN IN THOSE CIRCLES OF SOCIETY WHERE LITTLE INTEREST IS TAKEN IN LITERATURE. IF ANYONE WERE TO SURPRISE HIM BY BEING INDIFFERENT, HE WOULD BE MORBIDLY CHAGRINED, AND TRY TO REVENGE HIMSELF.

A YEAR BEFORE, I HAD READ AN ARTICLE OF HIS IN A REVIEW, WRITTEN WITH AN IMMENSE AFFECTATION OF NA√ØVE POETRY, AND PSYCHOLOGY TOO. HE DESCRIBED THE WRECK OF SOME STEAMER ON THE ENGLISH COAST, OF WHICH HE HAD BEEN THE WITNESS, AND HOW HE HAD SEEN THE DROWNING PEOPLE SAVED, AND THE DEAD BODIES BROUGHT ASHORE. ALL THIS RATHER LONG AND VERBOSE ARTICLE WAS WRITTEN SOLELY WITH THE OBJECT OF SELF-DISPLAY. ONE SEEMED TO READ BETWEEN THE LINES: ‚ÄÚCONCENTRATE YOURSELVES ON ME. BEHOLD WHAT I WAS LIKE AT THOSE MOMENTS. WHAT ARE THE SEA, THE STORM, THE ROCKS, THE SPLINTERS OF WRECKED SHIPS TO YOU? I HAVE DESCRIBED ALL THAT SUFFICIENTLY TO YOU WITH MY MIGHTY PEN. WHY LOOK AT THAT DROWNED WOMAN WITH THE DEAD CHILD IN HER DEAD ARMS? LOOK RATHER AT ME, SEE HOW I WAS UNABLE TO BEAR THAT SIGHT AND TURNED AWAY FROM IT. HERE I STOOD WITH MY BACK TO IT; HERE I WAS HORRIFIED AND COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO LOOK; I BLINKED MY EYES‚ÄÎISN‚ÄÔT THAT INTERESTING?‚ÄÙ WHEN I TOLD STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH MY OPINION OF KARMAZINOV‚ÄÔS ARTICLE HE QUITE AGREED WITH ME.

WHEN RUMOURS HAD REACHED US OF LATE THAT KARMAZINOV WAS COMING TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD I WAS, OF COURSE, VERY EAGER TO SEE HIM, AND, IF POSSIBLE, TO MAKE HIS ACQUAINTANCE. I KNEW THAT THIS MIGHT BE DONE THROUGH STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, THEY HAD ONCE BEEN FRIENDS. AND NOW I SUDDENLY MET HIM AT THE CROSS-ROADS. I KNEW HIM AT ONCE. HE HAD BEEN POINTED OUT TO ME TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE WHEN HE DROVE PAST WITH THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE. HE WAS A SHORT, STIFF-LOOKING OLD MAN, THOUGH NOT OVER FIFTY-FIVE, WITH A RATHER RED LITTLE FACE, WITH THICK GREY LOCKS OF HAIR CLUSTERING UNDER HIS CHIMNEY-POT HAT, AND CURLING ROUND HIS CLEAN LITTLE PINK EARS. HIS CLEAN LITTLE FACE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER HANDSOME WITH ITS THIN, LONG, CRAFTY-LOOKING LIPS, WITH ITS RATHER FLESHY NOSE, AND ITS SHARP, SHREWD LITTLE EYES. HE WAS DRESSED SOMEWHAT SHABBILY IN A SORT OF CAPE SUCH AS WOULD BE WORN IN SWITZERLAND OR NORTH ITALY AT THAT TIME OF YEAR. BUT, AT ANY RATE, ALL THE MINOR DETAILS OF HIS COSTUME, THE LITTLE STUDS, AND COLLAR, THE BUTTONS, THE TORTOISE-SHELL LORGNETTE ON A NARROW BLACK RIBBON, THE SIGNET-RING, WERE ALL SUCH AS ARE WORN BY PERSONS OF THE MOST IRREPROACHABLE GOOD FORM. I AM CERTAIN THAT IN SUMMER HE MUST HAVE WORN LIGHT PRUNELLA SHOES WITH MOTHER-OF-PEARL BUTTONS AT THE SIDE. WHEN WE MET HE WAS STANDING STILL AT THE TURNING AND LOOKING ABOUT HIM, ATTENTIVELY. NOTICING THAT I WAS LOOKING AT HIM WITH INTEREST, HE ASKED ME IN A SUGARY, THOUGH RATHER SHRILL VOICE:

‚ÄÚALLOW ME TO ASK, WHICH IS MY NEAREST WAY TO BYKOVY STREET?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO BYKOVY STREET? OH, THAT‚ÄÔS HERE, CLOSE BY,‚ÄÙ I CRIED IN GREAT EXCITEMENT. ‚ÄÚSTRAIGHT ON ALONG THIS STREET AND THE SECOND TURNING TO THE LEFT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚVERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU.‚ÄÙ

A CURSE ON THAT MINUTE! I FANCY I WAS SHY, AND LOOKED CRINGING. HE INSTANTLY NOTICED ALL THAT, AND OF COURSE REALISED IT ALL AT ONCE; THAT IS, REALISED THAT I KNEW WHO HE WAS, THAT I HAD READ HIM AND REVERED HIM FROM A CHILD, AND THAT I WAS SHY AND LOOKED AT HIM CRINGINGLY. HE SMILED, NODDED AGAIN, AND WALKED ON AS I HAD DIRECTED HIM. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHY I TURNED BACK TO FOLLOW HIM; I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHY I RAN FOR TEN PACES BESIDE HIM. HE SUDDENLY STOOD STILL AGAIN.

‚ÄÚAND COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE IS THE NEAREST CAB-STAND?‚ÄÙ HE SHOUTED OUT TO ME AGAIN.

IT WAS A HORRID SHOUT! A HORRID VOICE!

‚ÄÚA CAB-STAND? THE NEAREST CAB-STAND IS ‚Ä¶ BY THE CATHEDRAL; THERE ARE ALWAYS CABS STANDING THERE,‚ÄÙ AND I ALMOST TURNED TO RUN FOR A CAB FOR HIM. I ALMOST BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS WHAT HE EXPECTED ME TO DO. OF COURSE I CHECKED MYSELF AT ONCE, AND STOOD STILL, BUT HE HAD NOTICED MY MOVEMENT AND WAS STILL WATCHING ME WITH THE SAME HORRID SMILE. THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED WHICH I SHALL NEVER FORGET.

HE SUDDENLY DROPPED A TINY BAG, WHICH HE WAS HOLDING IN HIS LEFT HAND; THOUGH INDEED IT WAS NOT A BAG, BUT RATHER A LITTLE BOX, OR MORE PROBABLY SOME PART OF A POCKET-BOOK, OR TO BE MORE ACCURATE A LITTLE RETICULE, RATHER LIKE AN OLD-FASHIONED LADY‚ÄÔS RETICULE, THOUGH I REALLY DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT IT WAS. I ONLY KNOW THAT I FLEW TO PICK IT UP.

I AM CONVINCED THAT I DID NOT REALLY PICK IT UP, BUT MY FIRST MOTION WAS UNMISTAKABLE. I COULD NOT CONCEAL IT, AND, LIKE A FOOL, I TURNED CRIMSON. THE CUNNING FELLOW AT ONCE GOT ALL THAT COULD BE GOT OUT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE.

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT TROUBLE, I‚ÄÔLL PICK IT UP,‚ÄÙ HE PRONOUNCED CHARMINGLY; THAT IS, WHEN HE WAS QUITE SURE THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO PICK UP THE RETICULE, HE PICKED IT UP AS THOUGH FORESTALLING ME, NODDED ONCE MORE, AND WENT HIS WAY, LEAVING ME TO LOOK LIKE A FOOL. IT WAS AS GOOD AS THOUGH I HAD PICKED IT UP MYSELF. FOR FIVE MINUTES I CONSIDERED MYSELF UTTERLY DISGRACED FOREVER, BUT AS I REACHED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS HOUSE I SUDDENLY BURST OUT LAUGHING; THE MEETING STRUCK ME AS SO AMUSING THAT I IMMEDIATELY RESOLVED TO ENTERTAIN STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WITH AN ACCOUNT OF IT, AND EVEN TO ACT THE WHOLE SCENE TO HIM.

III

BUT THIS TIME TO MY SURPRISE I FOUND AN EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE IN HIM. HE POUNCED ON ME WITH A SORT OF AVIDITY, IT IS TRUE, AS SOON AS I WENT IN, AND BEGAN LISTENING TO ME, BUT WITH SUCH A DISTRACTED AIR THAT AT FIRST HE EVIDENTLY DID NOT TAKE IN MY WORDS. BUT AS SOON AS I PRONOUNCED THE NAME OF KARMAZINOV HE SUDDENLY FLEW INTO A FRENZY.

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT SPEAK OF HIM! DON‚ÄÔT PRONOUNCE THAT NAME!‚ÄÙ HE EXCLAIMED, ALMOST IN A FURY. ‚ÄÚHERE, LOOK, READ IT! READ IT!‚ÄÙ

HE OPENED THE DRAWER AND THREW ON THE TABLE THREE SMALL SHEETS OF PAPER, COVERED WITH A HURRIED PENCIL SCRAWL, ALL FROM VARVARA PETROVNA. THE FIRST LETTER WAS DATED THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY, THE SECOND HAD COME YESTERDAY, AND THE LAST THAT DAY, AN HOUR BEFORE. THEIR CONTENTS WERE QUITE TRIVIAL, AND ALL REFERRED TO KARMAZINOV AND BETRAYED THE VAIN AND FUSSY UNEASINESS OF VARVARA PETROVNA AND HER APPREHENSION THAT KARMAZINOV MIGHT FORGET TO PAY HER A VISIT. HERE IS THE FIRST ONE DATING FROM TWO DAYS BEFORE. (PROBABLY THERE HAD BEEN ONE ALSO THREE DAYS BEFORE, AND POSSIBLY ANOTHER FOUR DAYS BEFORE AS WELL.)

‚ÄÚIF HE DEIGNS TO VISIT YOU TO-DAY, NOT A WORD ABOUT ME, I BEG. NOT THE FAINTEST HINT. DON‚ÄÔT SPEAK OF ME, DON‚ÄÔT MENTION ME.‚ÄÎV. S.‚ÄÙ

THE LETTER OF THE DAY BEFORE:

‚ÄÚIF HE DECIDES TO PAY YOU A VISIT THIS MORNING, I THINK THE MOST DIGNIFIED THING WOULD BE NOT TO RECEIVE HIM. THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT I THINK ABOUT IT; I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.‚ÄÎV. S.‚ÄÙ

TO-DAY‚ÄÔS, THE LAST:

‚ÄÚI FEEL SURE THAT YOU‚ÄÔRE IN A REGULAR LITTER AND CLOUDS OF TOBACCO SMOKE. I‚ÄÔM SENDING YOU MARYA AND FOMUSHKA. THEY‚ÄÔLL TIDY YOU UP IN HALF AN HOUR. AND DON‚ÄÔT HINDER THEM, BUT GO AND SIT IN THE KITCHEN WHILE THEY CLEAR UP. I‚ÄÔM SENDING YOU A BOKHARA RUG AND TWO CHINA VASES. I‚ÄÔVE LONG BEEN MEANING TO MAKE YOU A PRESENT OF THEM, AND I‚ÄÔM SENDING YOU MY TENIERS, TOO, FOR A TIME! YOU CAN PUT THE VASES IN THE WINDOW AND HANG THE TENIERS ON THE RIGHT UNDER THE PORTRAIT OF GOETHE; IT WILL BE MORE CONSPICUOUS THERE AND IT‚ÄÔS ALWAYS LIGHT THERE IN THE MORNING. IF HE DOES TURN UP AT LAST, RECEIVE HIM WITH THE UTMOST COURTESY BUT TRY AND TALK OF TRIFLING MATTERS, OF SOME INTELLECTUAL SUBJECT, AND BEHAVE AS THOUGH YOU HAD SEEN EACH OTHER LATELY. NOT A WORD ABOUT ME. PERHAPS I MAY LOOK IN ON YOU IN THE EVENING.‚ÄÎV. S.

‚ÄÚP.S.‚ÄÎIF HE DOES NOT COME TO-DAY HE WON‚ÄÔT COME AT ALL.‚ÄÙ

I READ AND WAS AMAZED THAT HE WAS IN SUCH EXCITEMENT OVER SUCH TRIFLES. LOOKING AT HIM INQUIRINGLY, I NOTICED THAT HE HAD HAD TIME WHILE I WAS READING TO CHANGE THE EVERLASTING WHITE TIE HE ALWAYS WORE, FOR A RED ONE. HIS HAT AND STICK LAY ON THE TABLE. HE WAS PALE, AND HIS HANDS WERE POSITIVELY TREMBLING.

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT CARE A HANG ABOUT HER ANXIETIES,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED FRANTICALLY, IN RESPONSE TO MY INQUIRING LOOK. ‚ÄÚJE M‚ÄÔEN FICHE! SHE HAS THE FACE TO BE EXCITED ABOUT KARMAZINOV, AND SHE DOES NOT ANSWER MY LETTERS. HERE IS MY UNOPENED LETTER WHICH SHE SENT ME BACK YESTERDAY, HERE ON THE TABLE UNDER THE BOOK, UNDER L‚ÄÔHOMME QUI RIT. WHAT IS IT TO ME THAT SHE‚ÄÔS WEARING HERSELF OUT OVER NIKOLAY! JE M‚ÄÔEN FICHE, ET JE PROCLAME MA LIBERT√©! AU DIABLE LE KARMAZINOV! AU DIABLE LA LEMBKE! I‚ÄÔVE HIDDEN THE VASES IN THE ENTRY, AND THE TENIERS IN THE CHEST OF DRAWERS, AND I HAVE DEMANDED THAT SHE IS TO SEE ME AT ONCE. DO YOU HEAR. I‚ÄÔVE INSISTED! I‚ÄÔVE SENT HER JUST SUCH A SCRAP OF PAPER, A PENCIL SCRAWL, UNSEALED, BY NASTASYA, AND I‚ÄÔM WAITING. I WANT DARYA PAVLOVNA TO SPEAK TO ME WITH HER OWN LIPS, BEFORE THE FACE OF HEAVEN, OR AT LEAST BEFORE YOU. VOUS ME SECONDEREZ, N‚ÄÔEST-CE PAS, COMME AMI ET T√©MOIN. I DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO HAVE TO BLUSH, TO LIE, I DON‚ÄÔT WANT SECRETS, I WON‚ÄÔT HAVE SECRETS IN THIS MATTER. LET THEM CONFESS EVERYTHING TO ME OPENLY, FRANKLY, HONOURABLY AND THEN ‚Ä¶ THEN PERHAPS I MAY SURPRISE THE WHOLE GENERATION BY MY MAGNANIMITY.‚Ä¶ AM I A SCOUNDREL OR NOT, MY DEAR SIR?‚ÄÙ HE CONCLUDED SUDDENLY, LOOKING MENACINGLY AT ME, AS THOUGH I‚ÄÔD CONSIDERED HIM A SCOUNDREL.

I OFFERED HIM A SIP OF WATER; I HAD NEVER SEEN HIM LIKE THIS BEFORE. ALL THE WHILE HE WAS TALKING HE KEPT RUNNING FROM ONE END OF THE ROOM TO THE OTHER, BUT HE SUDDENLY STOOD STILL BEFORE ME IN AN EXTRAORDINARY ATTITUDE.

‚ÄÚCAN YOU SUPPOSE,‚ÄÙ HE BEGAN AGAIN WITH HYSTERICAL HAUGHTINESS, LOOKING ME UP AND DOWN, ‚ÄÚCAN YOU IMAGINE THAT I, STEPAN VERHOVENSKY, CANNOT FIND IN MYSELF THE MORAL STRENGTH TO TAKE MY BAG‚ÄÎMY BEGGAR‚ÄÔS BAG‚ÄÎAND LAYING IT ON MY FEEBLE SHOULDERS TO GO OUT AT THE GATE AND VANISH FOREVER, WHEN HONOUR AND THE GREAT PRINCIPLE OF INDEPENDENCE DEMAND IT! IT‚ÄÔS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT STEPAN VERHOVENSKY HAS HAD TO REPEL DESPOTISM BY MORAL FORCE, EVEN THOUGH IT BE THE DESPOTISM OF A CRAZY WOMAN, THAT IS, THE MOST CRUEL AND INSULTING DESPOTISM WHICH CAN EXIST ON EARTH, ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE, I FANCY, FORGOTTEN YOURSELF SO MUCH AS TO LAUGH AT MY PHRASE, MY DEAR SIR! OH, YOU DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE THAT I CAN FIND THE MORAL STRENGTH IN MYSELF TO END MY LIFE AS A TUTOR IN A MERCHANT‚ÄÔS FAMILY, OR TO DIE OF HUNGER IN A DITCH! ANSWER ME, ANSWER AT ONCE; DO YOU BELIEVE IT, OR DON‚ÄÔT YOU BELIEVE IT?‚ÄÙ

BUT I WAS PURPOSELY SILENT. I EVEN AFFECTED TO HESITATE TO WOUND HIM BY ANSWERING IN THE NEGATIVE, BUT TO BE UNABLE TO ANSWER AFFIRMATIVELY. IN ALL THIS NERVOUS EXCITEMENT OF HIS THERE WAS SOMETHING WHICH REALLY DID OFFEND ME, AND NOT PERSONALLY, OH, NO! BUT ‚Ä¶ I WILL EXPLAIN LATER ON. HE POSITIVELY TURNED PALE.

‚ÄÚPERHAPS YOU ARE BORED WITH ME, G‚ÄÎ‚ÄÎV (THIS IS MY SURNAME), AND YOU WOULD LIKE ‚Ä¶ NOT TO COME AND SEE ME AT ALL?‚ÄÙ HE SAID IN THAT TONE OF PALE COMPOSURE WHICH USUALLY PRECEDES SOME EXTRAORDINARY OUTBURST. I JUMPED UP IN ALARM. AT THAT MOMENT NASTASYA CAME IN, AND, WITHOUT A WORD, HANDED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH A PIECE OF PAPER, ON WHICH SOMETHING WAS WRITTEN IN PENCIL. HE GLANCED AT IT AND FLUNG IT TO ME. ON THE PAPER, IN VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS HAND THREE WORDS WERE WRITTEN: ‚ÄÚSTAY AT HOME.‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SNATCHED UP HIS HAT AND STICK IN SILENCE AND WENT QUICKLY OUT OF THE ROOM. MECHANICALLY I FOLLOWED HIM. SUDDENLY VOICES AND SOUNDS OF RAPID FOOTSTEPS WERE HEARD IN THE PASSAGE. HE STOOD STILL, AS THOUGH THUNDER-STRUCK.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS LIPUTIN; I AM LOST!‚ÄÙ HE WHISPERED, CLUTCHING AT MY ARM.

AT THE SAME INSTANT LIPUTIN WALKED INTO THE ROOM.

IV

WHY HE SHOULD BE LOST OWING TO LIPUTIN I DID NOT KNOW, AND INDEED I DID NOT ATTACH MUCH SIGNIFICANCE TO THE WORDS; I PUT IT ALL DOWN TO HIS NERVES. HIS TERROR, HOWEVER, WAS REMARKABLE, AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO KEEP A CAREFUL WATCH ON HIM.

THE VERY APPEARANCE OF LIPUTIN AS HE CAME IN ASSURED US THAT HE HAD ON THIS OCCASION A SPECIAL RIGHT TO COME IN, IN SPITE OF THE PROHIBITION. HE BROUGHT WITH HIM AN UNKNOWN GENTLEMAN, WHO MUST HAVE BEEN A NEW ARRIVAL IN THE TOWN. IN REPLY TO THE SENSELESS STARE OF MY PETRIFIED FRIEND, HE CALLED OUT IMMEDIATELY IN A LOUD VOICE:

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM BRINGING YOU A VISITOR, A SPECIAL ONE! I MAKE BOLD TO INTRUDE ON YOUR SOLITUDE. MR. KIRILLOV, A VERY DISTINGUISHED CIVIL ENGINEER. AND WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE HE KNOWS YOUR SON, THE MUCH ESTEEMED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, VERY INTIMATELY; AND HE HAS A MESSAGE FROM HIM. HE‚ÄÔS ONLY JUST ARRIVED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE MESSAGE IS YOUR OWN ADDITION,‚ÄÙ THE VISITOR OBSERVED CURTLY. ‚ÄÚTHERE‚ÄÔS NO MESSAGE AT ALL. BUT I CERTAINLY DO KNOW VERHOVENSKY. I LEFT HIM IN THE X. PROVINCE, TEN DAYS AHEAD OF US.‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH MECHANICALLY OFFERED HIS HAND AND MOTIONED HIM TO SIT DOWN. HE LOOKED AT ME, HE LOOKED AT LIPUTIN, AND THEN AS THOUGH SUDDENLY RECOLLECTING HIMSELF SAT DOWN HIMSELF, THOUGH HE STILL KEPT HIS HAT AND STICK IN HIS HANDS WITHOUT BEING AWARE OF IT.

‚ÄÚBAH, BUT YOU WERE GOING OUT YOURSELF! I WAS TOLD THAT YOU WERE QUITE KNOCKED UP WITH WORK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, I‚ÄÔM ILL, AND YOU SEE, I MEANT TO GO FOR A WALK, I ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH CHECKED HIMSELF, QUICKLY FLUNG HIS HAT AND STICK ON THE SOFA AND‚ÄÎTURNED CRIMSON.

MEANTIME, I WAS HURRIEDLY EXAMINING THE VISITOR. HE WAS A YOUNG MAN, ABOUT TWENTY-SEVEN, DECENTLY DRESSED, WELL MADE, SLENDER AND DARK, WITH A PALE, RATHER MUDDY-COLOURED FACE AND BLACK LUSTRELESS EYES. HE SEEMED RATHER THOUGHTFUL AND ABSENT-MINDED, SPOKE JERKILY AND UNGRAMMATICALLY, TRANSPOSING WORDS IN RATHER A STRANGE WAY, AND GETTING MUDDLED IF HE ATTEMPTED A SENTENCE OF ANY LENGTH. LIPUTIN WAS PERFECTLY AWARE OF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS ALARM, AND WAS OBVIOUSLY PLEASED AT IT. HE SAT DOWN IN A WICKER CHAIR WHICH HE DRAGGED ALMOST INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM, SO AS TO BE AT AN EQUAL DISTANCE BETWEEN HIS HOST AND THE VISITOR, WHO HAD INSTALLED THEMSELVES ON SOFAS ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ROOM. HIS SHARP EYES DARTED INQUISITIVELY FROM ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM TO ANOTHER.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS.‚Ä¶ A LONG WHILE SINCE I‚ÄÔVE SEEN PETRUSHA.‚Ä¶ YOU MET ABROAD?‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH MANAGED TO MUTTER TO THE VISITOR.

‚ÄÚBOTH HERE AND ABROAD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚALEXEY NILITCH HAS ONLY JUST RETURNED HIMSELF AFTER LIVING FOUR YEARS ABROAD,‚ÄÙ PUT IN LIPUTIN. ‚ÄÚHE HAS BEEN TRAVELLING TO PERFECT HIMSELF IN HIS SPECIALITY AND HAS COME TO US BECAUSE HE HAS GOOD REASONS TO EXPECT A JOB ON THE BUILDING OF OUR RAILWAY BRIDGE, AND HE‚ÄÔS NOW WAITING FOR AN ANSWER ABOUT IT. HE KNOWS THE DROZDOVS AND LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA, THROUGH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH.‚ÄÙ

THE ENGINEER SAT, AS IT WERE, WITH A RUFFLED AIR, AND LISTENED WITH AWKWARD IMPATIENCE. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE WAS ANGRY ABOUT SOMETHING.

‚ÄÚHE KNOWS NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH TOO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH?‚ÄÙ INQUIRED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.

‚ÄÚI KNOW HIM TOO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS ‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS A VERY LONG TIME SINCE I‚ÄÔVE SEEN PETRUSHA, AND ‚Ä¶ I FEEL I HAVE SO LITTLE RIGHT TO CALL MYSELF A FATHER ‚Ä¶ C‚ÄÔEST LE MOT; I ‚Ä¶ HOW DID YOU LEAVE HIM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, YES, I LEFT HIM ‚Ä¶ HE COMES HIMSELF,‚ÄÙ REPLIED MR. KIRILLOV, IN HASTE TO BE RID OF THE QUESTION AGAIN. HE CERTAINLY WAS ANGRY.

‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS COMING! AT LAST I ‚Ä¶ YOU SEE, IT‚ÄÔS VERY LONG SINCE I‚ÄÔVE SEEN PETRUSHA!‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH COULD NOT GET AWAY FROM THIS PHRASE. ‚ÄÚNOW I EXPECT MY POOR BOY TO WHOM ‚Ä¶ TO WHOM I HAVE BEEN SO MUCH TO BLAME! THAT IS, I MEAN TO SAY, WHEN I LEFT HIM IN PETERSBURG, I ‚Ä¶ IN SHORT, I LOOKED ON HIM AS A NONENTITY, QUELQUE CHOSE DANS CE GENRE. HE WAS A VERY NERVOUS BOY, YOU KNOW, EMOTIONAL, AND ‚Ä¶ VERY TIMID. WHEN HE SAID HIS PRAYERS GOING TO BED HE USED TO BOW DOWN TO THE GROUND, AND MAKE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS ON HIS PILLOW THAT HE MIGHT NOT DIE IN THE NIGHT.‚Ä¶ JE M‚ÄÔEN SOUVIENS. ENFIN, NO ARTISTIC FEELING WHATEVER, NOT A SIGN OF ANYTHING HIGHER, OF ANYTHING FUNDAMENTAL, NO EMBRYO OF A FUTURE IDEAL ‚Ä¶ C‚ÄÔ√©TAIT COMME UN PETIT IDIOT, BUT I‚ÄÔM AFRAID I AM INCOHERENT; EXCUSE ME ‚Ä¶ YOU CAME UPON ME ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU SAY SERIOUSLY THAT HE CROSSED HIS PILLOW?‚ÄÙ THE ENGINEER ASKED SUDDENLY WITH MARKED CURIOSITY.

‚ÄÚYES, HE USED TO ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚALL RIGHT. I JUST ASKED. GO ON.‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH LOOKED INTERROGATIVELY AT LIPUTIN.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR VISIT. BUT I MUST CONFESS I‚ÄÔM ‚Ä¶ NOT IN A CONDITION ‚Ä¶ JUST NOW ‚Ä¶ BUT ALLOW ME TO ASK WHERE YOU ARE LODGING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAT FILIPOV‚ÄÔS, IN BOGOYAVLENSKY STREET.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚACH, THAT‚ÄÔS WHERE SHATOV LIVES,‚ÄÙ I OBSERVED INVOLUNTARILY.

‚ÄÚJUST SO, IN THE VERY SAME HOUSE,‚ÄÙ CRIED LIPUTIN, ‚ÄÚONLY SHATOV LODGES ABOVE, IN THE ATTIC, WHILE HE‚ÄÔS DOWN BELOW, AT CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS. HE KNOWS SHATOV TOO, AND HE KNOWS SHATOV‚ÄÔS WIFE. HE WAS VERY INTIMATE WITH HER, ABROAD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCOMMENT! DO YOU REALLY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT UNHAPPY MARRIAGE DE CE PAUVRE AMI AND THAT WOMAN,‚ÄÙ CRIED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, CARRIED AWAY BY SUDDEN FEELING. ‚ÄÚYOU ARE THE FIRST MAN I‚ÄÔVE MET WHO HAS KNOWN HER PERSONALLY; AND IF ONLY ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT NONSENSE!‚ÄÙ THE ENGINEER SNAPPED OUT, FLUSHING ALL OVER. ‚ÄÚHOW YOU ADD TO THINGS, LIPUTIN! I‚ÄÔVE NOT SEEN SHATOV‚ÄÔS WIFE; I‚ÄÔVE ONLY ONCE SEEN HER IN THE DISTANCE AND NOT AT ALL CLOSE.‚Ä¶ I KNOW SHATOV. WHY DO YOU ADD THINGS OF ALL SORTS?‚ÄÙ

HE TURNED ROUND SHARPLY ON THE SOFA, CLUTCHED HIS HAT, THEN LAID IT DOWN AGAIN, AND SETTLING HIMSELF DOWN ONCE MORE AS BEFORE, FIXED HIS ANGRY BLACK EYES ON STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WITH A SORT OF DEFIANCE. I WAS AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND SUCH STRANGE IRRITABILITY.

‚ÄÚEXCUSE ME,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH OBSERVED IMPRESSIVELY. ‚ÄÚI UNDERSTAND THAT IT MAY BE A VERY DELICATE SUBJECT.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO SORT OF DELICATE SUBJECT IN IT, AND INDEED IT‚ÄÔS SHAMEFUL, AND I DIDN‚ÄÔT SHOUT AT YOU THAT IT‚ÄÔS NONSENSE, BUT AT LIPUTIN, BECAUSE HE ADDS THINGS. EXCUSE ME IF YOU TOOK IT TO YOURSELF. I KNOW SHATOV, BUT I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HIS WIFE AT ALL ‚Ä¶ I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HER AT ALL!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND. AND IF I INSISTED, IT‚ÄÔS ONLY BECAUSE I‚ÄÔM VERY FOND OF OUR POOR FRIEND, NOTRE IRASCIBLE AMI, AND HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN AN INTEREST IN HIM.‚Ä¶ IN MY OPINION THAT MAN CHANGED HIS FORMER, POSSIBLY OVER-YOUTHFUL BUT YET SOUND IDEAS, TOO ABRUPTLY. AND NOW HE SAYS ALL SORTS OF THINGS ABOUT NOTRE SAINTE RUSSIE TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT I‚ÄÔVE LONG EXPLAINED THIS UPHEAVAL IN HIS WHOLE CONSTITUTION, I CAN ONLY CALL IT THAT, TO SOME VIOLENT SHOCK IN HIS FAMILY LIFE, AND, IN FACT, TO HIS UNSUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE. I, WHO KNOW MY POOR RUSSIA LIKE THE FINGERS ON MY HAND, AND HAVE DEVOTED MY WHOLE LIFE TO THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE, I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE, AND WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT KNOW THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE AT ALL, EITHER, AND I HAVEN‚ÄÔT TIME TO STUDY THEM,‚ÄÙ THE ENGINEER SNAPPED OUT AGAIN, AND AGAIN HE TURNED SHARPLY ON THE SOFA. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS PULLED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS SPEECH.

‚ÄÚHE IS STUDYING THEM, HE IS STUDYING THEM,‚ÄÙ INTERPOSED LIPUTIN. ‚ÄÚHE HAS ALREADY BEGUN THE STUDY OF THEM, AND IS WRITING A VERY INTERESTING ARTICLE DEALING WITH THE CAUSES OF THE INCREASE OF SUICIDE IN RUSSIA, AND, GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE CAUSES THAT LEAD TO THE INCREASE OR DECREASE OF SUICIDE IN SOCIETY. HE HAS REACHED AMAZING RESULTS.‚ÄÙ

THE ENGINEER BECAME DREADFULLY EXCITED. ‚ÄÚYOU HAVE NO RIGHT AT ALL,‚ÄÙ HE MUTTERED WRATHFULLY. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM NOT WRITING AN ARTICLE. I‚ÄÔM NOT GOING TO DO SILLY THINGS. I ASKED YOU CONFIDENTIALLY, QUITE BY CHANCE. THERE‚ÄÔS NO ARTICLE AT ALL. I‚ÄÔM NOT PUBLISHING, AND YOU HAVEN‚ÄÔT THE RIGHT ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN WAS OBVIOUSLY ENJOYING HIMSELF.

‚ÄÚI BEG YOUR PARDON, PERHAPS I MADE A MISTAKE IN CALLING YOUR LITERARY WORK AN ARTICLE. HE IS ONLY COLLECTING OBSERVATIONS, AND THE ESSENCE OF THE QUESTION, OR, SO TO SAY, ITS MORAL ASPECT HE IS NOT TOUCHING AT ALL. AND, INDEED, HE REJECTS MORALITY ITSELF ALTOGETHER, AND HOLDS WITH THE LAST NEW PRINCIPLE OF GENERAL DESTRUCTION FOR THE SAKE OF ULTIMATE GOOD. HE DEMANDS ALREADY MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLION HEADS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMON SENSE IN EUROPE; MANY MORE THAN THEY DEMANDED AT THE LAST PEACE CONGRESS. ALEXEY NILITCH GOES FURTHER THAN ANYONE IN THAT SENSE.‚ÄÙ THE ENGINEER LISTENED WITH A PALE AND CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE. FOR HALF A MINUTE EVERY ONE WAS SILENT.

‚ÄÚALL THIS IS STUPID, LIPUTIN,‚ÄÙ MR. KIRILLOV OBSERVED AT LAST, WITH A CERTAIN DIGNITY. ‚ÄÚIF I BY CHANCE HAD SAID SOME THINGS TO YOU, AND YOU CAUGHT THEM UP AGAIN, AS YOU LIKE. BUT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT, FOR I NEVER SPEAK TO ANYONE. I SCORN TO TALK.‚Ä¶ IF ONE HAS A CONVICTION THEN IT‚ÄÔS CLEAR TO ME.‚Ä¶ BUT YOU‚ÄÔRE DOING FOOLISHLY. I DON‚ÄÔT ARGUE ABOUT THINGS WHEN EVERYTHING‚ÄÔS SETTLED. I CAN‚ÄÔT BEAR ARGUING. I NEVER WANT TO ARGUE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND PERHAPS YOU ARE VERY WISE,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH COULD NOT RESIST SAYING.

‚ÄÚI APOLOGISE TO YOU, BUT I AM NOT ANGRY WITH ANYONE HERE,‚ÄÙ THE VISITOR WENT ON, SPEAKING HOTLY AND RAPIDLY. ‚ÄÚI HAVE SEEN FEW PEOPLE FOR FOUR YEARS. FOR FOUR YEARS I HAVE TALKED LITTLE AND HAVE TRIED TO SEE NO ONE, FOR MY OWN OBJECTS WHICH DO NOT CONCERN ANYONE ELSE, FOR FOUR YEARS. LIPUTIN FOUND THIS OUT AND IS LAUGHING. I UNDERSTAND AND DON‚ÄÔT MIND. I‚ÄÔM NOT READY TO TAKE OFFENCE, ONLY ANNOYED AT HIS LIBERTY. AND IF I DON‚ÄÔT EXPLAIN MY IDEAS TO YOU,‚ÄÙ HE CONCLUDED UNEXPECTEDLY, SCANNING US ALL WITH RESOLUTE EYES, ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS NOT AT ALL THAT I‚ÄÔM AFRAID OF YOUR GIVING INFORMATION TO THE GOVERNMENT; THAT‚ÄÔS NOT SO; PLEASE DO NOT IMAGINE NONSENSE OF THAT SORT.‚ÄÙ

NO ONE MADE ANY REPLY TO THESE WORDS. WE ONLY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER. EVEN LIPUTIN FORGOT TO SNIGGER.

‚ÄÚGENTLEMEN, I‚ÄÔM VERY SORRY‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎSTEPAN TROFIMOVITCH GOT UP RESOLUTELY FROM THE SOFA‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚBUT I FEEL ILL AND UPSET. EXCUSE ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚACH, THAT‚ÄÔS FOR US TO GO.‚ÄÙ MR. KIRILLOV STARTED, SNATCHING UP HIS CAP. ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS A GOOD THING YOU TOLD US. I‚ÄÔM SO FORGETFUL.‚ÄÙ

HE ROSE, AND WITH A GOOD-NATURED AIR WENT UP TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, HOLDING OUT HIS HAND.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM SORRY YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT WELL, AND I CAME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WISH YOU EVERY SUCCESS AMONG US,‚ÄÙ ANSWERED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, SHAKING HANDS WITH HIM HEARTILY AND WITHOUT HASTE. ‚ÄÚI UNDERSTAND THAT, IF AS YOU SAY YOU HAVE LIVED SO LONG ABROAD, CUTTING YOURSELF OFF FROM PEOPLE FOR OBJECTS OF YOUR OWN AND FORGETTING RUSSIA, YOU MUST INEVITABLY LOOK WITH WONDER ON US WHO ARE RUSSIANS TO THE BACKBONE, AND WE MUST FEEL THE SAME ABOUT YOU. MAIS CELA PASSERA. I‚ÄÔM ONLY PUZZLED AT ONE THING: YOU WANT TO BUILD OUR BRIDGE AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU DECLARE THAT YOU HOLD WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF UNIVERSAL DESTRUCTION. THEY WON‚ÄÔT LET YOU BUILD OUR BRIDGE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT! WHAT‚ÄÔS THAT YOU SAID? ACH, I SAY!‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV CRIED, MUCH STRUCK, AND HE SUDDENLY BROKE INTO THE MOST FRANK AND GOOD-HUMOURED LAUGHTER. FOR A MOMENT HIS FACE TOOK A QUITE CHILDLIKE EXPRESSION, WHICH I THOUGHT SUITED HIM PARTICULARLY. LIPUTIN RUBBED HIS HAND WITH DELIGHT AT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS WITTY REMARK. I KEPT WONDERING TO MYSELF WHY STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS SO FRIGHTENED OF LIPUTIN, AND WHY HE HAD CRIED OUT ‚ÄÚI AM LOST‚ÄÙ WHEN HE HEARD HIM COMING.

V

WE WERE ALL STANDING IN THE DOORWAY. IT WAS THE MOMENT WHEN HOSTS AND GUESTS HURRIEDLY EXCHANGE THE LAST AND MOST CORDIAL WORDS, AND THEN PART TO THEIR MUTUAL GRATIFICATION.

‚ÄÚTHE REASON HE‚ÄÔS SO CROSS TO-DAY,‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN DROPPED ALL AT ONCE, AS IT WERE CASUALLY, WHEN HE WAS JUST GOING OUT OF THE ROOM, ‚ÄÚIS BECAUSE HE HAD A DISTURBANCE TO-DAY WITH CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN OVER HIS SISTER. CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN THRASHES THAT PRECIOUS SISTER OF HIS, THE MAD GIRL, EVERY DAY WITH A WHIP, A REAL COSSACK WHIP, EVERY MORNING AND EVENING. SO ALEXEY NILITCH HAS POSITIVELY TAKEN THE LODGE SO AS NOT TO BE PRESENT. WELL, GOOD-BYE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚA SISTER? AN INVALID? WITH A WHIP?‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH CRIED OUT, AS THOUGH HE HAD SUDDENLY BEEN LASHED WITH A WHIP HIMSELF. ‚ÄÚWHAT SISTER? WHAT LEBYADKIN?‚ÄÙ ALL HIS FORMER TERROR CAME BACK IN AN INSTANT.

‚ÄÚLEBYADKIN! OH, THAT‚ÄÔS THE RETIRED CAPTAIN; HE USED ONLY TO CALL HIMSELF A LIEUTENANT BEFORE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, WHAT IS HIS RANK TO ME? WHAT SISTER? GOOD HEAVENS!‚Ä¶ YOU SAY LEBYADKIN? BUT THERE USED TO BE A LEBYADKIN HERE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS THE VERY MAN. ‚ÄÒOUR‚ÄÔ LEBYADKIN, AT VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS, YOU REMEMBER?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT HE WAS CAUGHT WITH FORGED PAPERS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, NOW HE‚ÄÔS COME BACK. HE‚ÄÔS BEEN HERE ALMOST THREE WEEKS AND UNDER THE MOST PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, BUT HE‚ÄÔS A SCOUNDREL?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAS THOUGH NO ONE COULD BE A SCOUNDREL AMONG US,‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN GRINNED SUDDENLY, HIS KNAVISH LITTLE EYES SEEMING TO PEER INTO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS SOUL.

‚ÄÚGOOD HEAVENS! I DIDN‚ÄÔT MEAN THAT AT ALL ‚Ä¶ THOUGH I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THAT, WITH YOU PARTICULARLY. BUT WHAT THEN, WHAT THEN? WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? YOU CERTAINLY MEANT SOMETHING BY THAT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, IT‚ÄÔS ALL SO TRIVIAL.‚Ä¶ THIS CAPTAIN TO ALL APPEARANCES WENT AWAY FROM US AT THAT TIME; NOT BECAUSE OF THE FORGED PAPERS, BUT SIMPLY TO LOOK FOR HIS SISTER, WHO WAS IN HIDING FROM HIM SOMEWHERE, IT SEEMS; WELL, AND NOW HE‚ÄÔS BROUGHT HER AND THAT‚ÄÔS THE WHOLE STORY. WHY DO YOU SEEM FRIGHTENED, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH? I ONLY TELL THIS FROM HIS DRUNKEN CHATTER THOUGH, HE DOESN‚ÄÔT SPEAK OF IT HIMSELF WHEN HE‚ÄÔS SOBER. HE‚ÄÔS AN IRRITABLE MAN, AND, SO TO SPEAK, √¶STHETIC IN A MILITARY STYLE; ONLY HE HAS BAD TASTE. AND THIS SISTER IS LAME AS WELL AS MAD. SHE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SEDUCED BY SOMEONE, AND MR. LEBYADKIN HAS, IT SEEMS, FOR MANY YEARS RECEIVED A YEARLY GRANT FROM THE SEDUCER BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR THE WOUND TO HIS HONOUR, SO IT WOULD SEEM AT LEAST FROM HIS CHATTER, THOUGH I BELIEVE IT‚ÄÔS ONLY DRUNKEN TALK. IT‚ÄÔS SIMPLY HIS BRAG. BESIDES, THAT SORT OF THING IS DONE MUCH CHEAPER. BUT THAT HE HAS A SUM OF MONEY IS PERFECTLY CERTAIN. TEN DAYS AGO HE WAS WALKING BAREFOOT, AND NOW I‚ÄÔVE SEEN HUNDREDS IN HIS HANDS. HIS SISTER HAS FITS OF SOME SORT EVERY DAY, SHE SHRIEKS AND HE ‚ÄÒKEEPS HER IN ORDER‚ÄÔ WITH THE WHIP. YOU MUST INSPIRE A WOMAN WITH RESPECT, HE SAYS. WHAT I CAN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND IS HOW SHATOV GOES ON LIVING ABOVE HIM. ALEXEY NILITCH HAS ONLY BEEN THREE DAYS WITH THEM. THEY WERE ACQUAINTED IN PETERSBURG, AND NOW HE‚ÄÔS TAKEN THE LODGE TO GET AWAY FROM THE DISTURBANCE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIS THIS ALL TRUE?‚ÄÙ SAID STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, ADDRESSING THE ENGINEER.

‚ÄÚYOU DO GOSSIP A LOT, LIPUTIN,‚ÄÙ THE LATTER MUTTERED WRATHFULLY.

‚ÄÚMYSTERIES, SECRETS! WHERE HAVE ALL THESE MYSTERIES AND SECRETS AMONG US SPRUNG FROM?‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM EXCLAIMING.

THE ENGINEER FROWNED, FLUSHED RED, SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM.

‚ÄÚALEXEY NILITCH POSITIVELY SNATCHED THE WHIP OUT OF HIS HAND, BROKE IT AND THREW IT OUT OF THE WINDOW, AND THEY HAD A VIOLENT QUARREL,‚ÄÙ ADDED LIPUTIN.

‚ÄÚWHY ARE YOU CHATTERING, LIPUTIN; IT‚ÄÔS STUPID. WHAT FOR?‚ÄÙ ALEXEY NILITCH TURNED AGAIN INSTANTLY.

‚ÄÚWHY BE SO MODEST AND CONCEAL THE GENEROUS IMPULSES OF ONE‚ÄÔS SOUL; THAT IS, OF YOUR SOUL? I‚ÄÔM NOT SPEAKING OF MY OWN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW STUPID IT IS ‚Ä¶ AND QUITE UNNECESSARY. LEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS STUPID AND QUITE WORTHLESS‚ÄÎAND NO USE TO THE CAUSE, AND ‚Ä¶ UTTERLY MISCHIEVOUS. WHY DO YOU KEEP BABBLING ALL SORTS OF THINGS? I‚ÄÔM GOING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, WHAT A PITY!‚ÄÙ CRIED LIPUTIN WITH A CANDID SMILE, ‚ÄÚOR I‚ÄÔD HAVE AMUSED YOU WITH ANOTHER LITTLE STORY, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. I CAME, INDEED, ON PURPOSE TO TELL YOU, THOUGH I DARE SAY YOU‚ÄÔVE HEARD IT ALREADY. WELL, TILL ANOTHER TIME, ALEXEY NILITCH IS IN SUCH A HURRY. GOOD-BYE FOR THE PRESENT. THE STORY CONCERNS VARVARA PETROVNA. SHE AMUSED ME THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY; SHE SENT FOR ME ON PURPOSE. IT‚ÄÔS SIMPLY KILLING. GOOD-BYE.‚ÄÙ

BUT AT THIS STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT LET HIM GO. HE SEIZED HIM BY THE SHOULDERS, TURNED HIM SHARPLY BACK INTO THE ROOM, AND SAT HIM DOWN IN A CHAIR. LIPUTIN WAS POSITIVELY SCARED.

‚ÄÚWHY, TO BE SURE,‚ÄÙ HE BEGAN, LOOKING WARILY AT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH FROM HIS CHAIR, ‚ÄÚSHE SUDDENLY SENT FOR ME AND ASKED ME ‚ÄÒCONFIDENTIALLY‚ÄÔ MY PRIVATE OPINION, WHETHER NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH IS MAD OR IN HIS RIGHT MIND. ISN‚ÄÔT THAT ASTONISHING?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE OUT OF YOUR MIND!‚ÄÙ MUTTERED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, AND SUDDENLY, AS THOUGH HE WERE BESIDE HIMSELF: ‚ÄÚLIPUTIN, YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT YOU ONLY CAME HERE TO TELL ME SOMETHING INSULTING OF THAT SORT AND ‚Ä¶ SOMETHING WORSE!‚ÄÙ

IN A FLASH, I RECALLED HIS CONJECTURE THAT LIPUTIN KNEW NOT ONLY MORE THAN WE DID ABOUT OUR AFFAIR, BUT SOMETHING ELSE WHICH WE SHOULD NEVER KNOW.

‚ÄÚUPON MY WORD, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH,‚ÄÙ MUTTERED LIPUTIN, SEEMING GREATLY ALARMED, ‚ÄÚUPON MY WORD ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOLD YOUR TONGUE AND BEGIN! I BEG YOU, MR. KIRILLOV, TO COME BACK TOO, AND BE PRESENT. I EARNESTLY BEG YOU! SIT DOWN, AND YOU, LIPUTIN, BEGIN DIRECTLY, SIMPLY AND WITHOUT ANY EXCUSES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF I HAD ONLY KNOWN IT WOULD UPSET YOU SO MUCH I WOULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE BEGUN AT ALL. AND OF COURSE I THOUGHT YOU KNEW ALL ABOUT IT FROM VARVARA PETROVNA HERSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU DIDN‚ÄÔT THINK THAT AT ALL. BEGIN, BEGIN, I TELL YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚONLY DO ME THE FAVOUR TO SIT DOWN YOURSELF, OR HOW CAN I SIT HERE WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING ABOUT BEFORE ME IN SUCH EXCITEMENT. I CAN‚ÄÔT SPEAK COHERENTLY.‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH RESTRAINED HIMSELF AND SANK IMPRESSIVELY INTO AN EASY CHAIR. THE ENGINEER STARED GLOOMILY AT THE FLOOR. LIPUTIN LOOKED AT THEM WITH INTENSE ENJOYMENT,

‚ÄÚHOW AM I TO BEGIN?‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔM TOO OVERWHELMED.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

VI

‚ÄÚTHE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY A SERVANT WAS SUDDENLY SENT TO ME: ‚ÄÒYOU ARE ASKED TO CALL AT TWELVE O‚ÄÔCLOCK,‚ÄÔ SAID HE. CAN YOU FANCY SUCH A THING? I THREW ASIDE MY WORK, AND PRECISELY AT MIDDAY YESTERDAY I WAS RINGING AT THE BELL. I WAS LET INTO THE DRAWING ROOM; I WAITED A MINUTE‚ÄÎSHE CAME IN; SHE MADE ME SIT DOWN AND SAT DOWN HERSELF, OPPOSITE. I SAT DOWN, AND I COULDN‚ÄÔT BELIEVE IT; YOU KNOW HOW SHE HAS ALWAYS TREATED ME. SHE BEGAN AT ONCE WITHOUT BEATING ABOUT THE BUSH, YOU KNOW HER WAY. ‚ÄÒYOU REMEMBER,‚ÄÔ SHE SAID, ‚ÄÒTHAT FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS ILL HE DID SOME STRANGE THINGS WHICH MADE ALL THE TOWN WONDER TILL THE POSITION WAS EXPLAINED. ONE OF THOSE ACTIONS CONCERNED YOU PERSONALLY. WHEN NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH RECOVERED HE WENT AT MY REQUEST TO CALL ON YOU. I KNOW THAT HE TALKED TO YOU SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE, TOO. TELL ME OPENLY AND CANDIDLY WHAT YOU ‚Ä¶ (SHE FALTERED A LITTLE AT THIS POINT) WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH THEN ‚Ä¶ WHAT WAS YOUR VIEW OF HIM ALTOGETHER ‚Ä¶ WHAT IDEA YOU WERE ABLE TO FORM OF HIM AT THAT TIME ‚Ä¶ AND STILL HAVE?‚ÄÔ

‚ÄÚHERE SHE WAS COMPLETELY CONFUSED, SO THAT SHE PAUSED FOR A WHOLE MINUTE, AND SUDDENLY FLUSHED. I WAS ALARMED. SHE BEGAN AGAIN‚ÄÎTOUCHINGLY IS NOT QUITE THE WORD, IT‚ÄÔS NOT APPLICABLE TO HER‚ÄÎBUT IN A VERY IMPRESSIVE TONE:

‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒI WANT YOU,‚ÄÔ SHE SAID, ‚ÄÒTO UNDERSTAND ME CLEARLY AND WITHOUT MISTAKE. I‚ÄÔVE SENT FOR YOU NOW BECAUSE I LOOK UPON YOU AS A KEEN-SIGHTED AND QUICK-WITTED MAN, QUALIFIED TO MAKE ACCURATE OBSERVATIONS.‚ÄÔ (WHAT COMPLIMENTS!) ‚ÄÒYOU‚ÄÔLL UNDERSTAND TOO,‚ÄÔ SHE SAID, ‚ÄÒTHAT I AM A MOTHER APPEALING TO YOU.‚Ä¶ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAS SUFFERED SOME CALAMITIES AND HAS PASSED THROUGH MANY CHANGES OF FORTUNE IN HIS LIFE. ALL THAT,‚ÄÔ SHE SAID, ‚ÄÒMIGHT WELL HAVE AFFECTED THE STATE OF HIS MIND. I‚ÄÔM NOT SPEAKING OF MADNESS, OF COURSE,‚ÄÔ SHE SAID, ‚ÄÒTHAT‚ÄÔS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION!‚ÄÔ (THIS WAS UTTERED PROUDLY AND RESOLUTELY.) ‚ÄÒBUT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING STRANGE, SOMETHING PECULIAR, SOME TURN OF THOUGHT, A TENDENCY TO SOME PARTICULAR WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS.‚ÄÔ (THOSE WERE HER EXACT WORDS, AND I ADMIRED, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, THE EXACTNESS WITH WHICH VARVARA PETROVNA CAN PUT THINGS. SHE‚ÄÔS A LADY OF SUPERIOR INTELLECT!) ‚ÄÒI HAVE NOTICED IN HIM, ANYWAY,‚ÄÔ SHE SAID, ‚ÄÒA PERPETUAL RESTLESSNESS AND A TENDENCY TO PECULIAR IMPULSES. BUT I AM A MOTHER AND YOU ARE AN IMPARTIAL SPECTATOR, AND THEREFORE QUALIFIED WITH YOUR INTELLIGENCE TO FORM A MORE IMPARTIAL OPINION. I IMPLORE YOU, IN FACT‚ÄÔ (YES, THAT WORD, ‚ÄÒIMPLORE‚ÄÔ WAS UTTERED!), ‚ÄÒTO TELL ME THE WHOLE TRUTH, WITHOUT MINCING MATTERS. AND IF YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR WORD NEVER TO FORGET THAT I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU IN CONFIDENCE, YOU MAY RECKON UPON MY ALWAYS BEING READY TO SEIZE EVERY OPPORTUNITY IN THE FUTURE TO SHOW MY GRATITUDE.‚ÄÔ WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU HAVE ‚Ä¶ SO AMAZED ME ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ FALTERED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, ‚ÄÚTHAT I DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, OBSERVE, OBSERVE,‚ÄÙ CRIED LIPUTIN, AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT HEARD STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, ‚ÄÚOBSERVE WHAT MUST BE HER AGITATION AND UNEASINESS IF SHE STOOPS FROM HER GRANDEUR TO APPEAL TO A MAN LIKE ME, AND EVEN CONDESCENDS TO BEG ME TO KEEP IT SECRET. WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT? HASN‚ÄÔT SHE RECEIVED SOME NEWS OF NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, SOMETHING UNEXPECTED?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT KNOW ‚Ä¶ OF NEWS OF ANY SORT ‚Ä¶ I HAVEN‚ÄÔT SEEN HER FOR SOME DAYS, BUT ‚Ä¶ BUT I MUST SAY ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ LISPED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, EVIDENTLY HARDLY ABLE TO THINK CLEARLY, ‚ÄÚBUT I MUST SAY, LIPUTIN, THAT IF IT WAS SAID TO YOU IN CONFIDENCE, AND HERE YOU‚ÄÔRE TELLING IT BEFORE EVERY ONE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚABSOLUTELY IN CONFIDENCE! BUT GOD STRIKE ME DEAD IF I ‚Ä¶ BUT AS FOR TELLING IT HERE ‚Ä¶ WHAT DOES IT MATTER? ARE WE STRANGERS, EVEN ALEXEY NILITCH?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT SHARE THAT ATTITUDE. NO DOUBT WE THREE HERE WILL KEEP THE SECRET, BUT I‚ÄÔM AFRAID OF THE FOURTH, YOU, AND WOULDN‚ÄÔT TRUST YOU IN ANYTHING.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? WHY IT‚ÄÔS MORE TO MY INTEREST THAN ANYONE‚ÄÔS, SEEING I WAS PROMISED ETERNAL GRATITUDE! WHAT I WANTED WAS TO POINT OUT IN THIS CONNECTION ONE EXTREMELY STRANGE INCIDENT, RATHER TO SAY, PSYCHOLOGICAL THAN SIMPLY STRANGE. YESTERDAY EVENING, UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MY CONVERSATION WITH VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÎYOU CAN FANCY YOURSELF WHAT AN IMPRESSION IT MADE ON ME‚ÄÎI APPROACHED ALEXEY NILITCH WITH A DISCREET QUESTION: ‚ÄÒYOU KNEW NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH ABROAD,‚ÄÔ SAID I, ‚ÄÒAND USED TO KNOW HIM BEFORE IN PETERSBURG TOO. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIS MIND AND HIS ABILITIES?‚ÄÔ SAID I. HE ANSWERED LACONICALLY, AS HIS WAY IS, THAT HE WAS A MAN OF SUBTLE INTELLECT AND SOUND JUDGMENT. ‚ÄÒAND HAVE YOU NEVER NOTICED IN THE COURSE OF YEARS,‚ÄÔ SAID I, ‚ÄÒANY TURN OF IDEAS OR PECULIAR WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS, OR ANY, SO TO SAY, INSANITY?‚ÄÔ IN FACT, I REPEATED VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS OWN QUESTION. AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT, ALEXEY NILITCH SUDDENLY GREW THOUGHTFUL, AND SCOWLED, JUST AS HE‚ÄÔS DOING NOW. ‚ÄÒYES,‚ÄÔ SAID HE, ‚ÄÒI HAVE SOMETIMES THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE.‚ÄÔ TAKE NOTE, TOO, THAT IF ANYTHING COULD HAVE SEEMED STRANGE EVEN TO ALEXEY NILITCH, IT MUST REALLY HAVE BEEN SOMETHING, MUSTN‚ÄÔT IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIS THAT TRUE?‚ÄÙ SAID STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, TURNING TO ALEXEY NILITCH.

‚ÄÚI SHOULD PREFER NOT TO SPEAK OF IT,‚ÄÙ ANSWERED ALEXEY NILITCH, SUDDENLY RAISING HIS HEAD, AND LOOKING AT HIM WITH FLASHING EYES. ‚ÄÚI WISH TO CONTEST YOUR RIGHT TO DO THIS, LIPUTIN. YOU‚ÄÔVE NO RIGHT TO DRAG ME INTO THIS. I DID NOT GIVE MY WHOLE OPINION AT ALL. THOUGH I KNEW NIKOLAY STAVROGIN IN PETERSBURG THAT WAS LONG AGO, AND THOUGH I‚ÄÔVE MET HIM SINCE I KNOW HIM VERY LITTLE. I BEG YOU TO LEAVE ME OUT AND ‚Ä¶ ALL THIS IS SOMETHING LIKE SCANDAL.‚ÄÙ

LIPUTIN THREW UP HIS HANDS WITH AN AIR OF OPPRESSED INNOCENCE.

‚ÄÚA SCANDAL-MONGER! WHY NOT SAY A SPY WHILE YOU‚ÄÔRE ABOUT IT? IT‚ÄÔS ALL VERY WELL FOR YOU, ALEXEY NILITCH, TO CRITICISE WHEN YOU STAND ALOOF FROM EVERYTHING. BUT YOU WOULDN‚ÄÔT BELIEVE IT, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÎTAKE CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN, HE IS STUPID ENOUGH, ONE MAY SAY ‚Ä¶ IN FACT, ONE‚ÄÔS ASHAMED TO SAY HOW STUPID HE IS; THERE IS A RUSSIAN COMPARISON, TO SIGNIFY THE DEGREE OF IT; AND DO YOU KNOW HE CONSIDERS HIMSELF INJURED BY NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, THOUGH HE IS FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR HIS WIT. ‚ÄÒI‚ÄÔM AMAZED,‚ÄÔ SAID HE, ‚ÄÒAT THAT MAN. HE‚ÄÔS A SUBTLE SERPENT.‚ÄÔ HIS OWN WORDS. AND I SAID TO HIM (STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MY CONVERSATION, AND AFTER I HAD SPOKEN TO ALEXEY NILITCH), ‚ÄÒWHAT DO YOU THINK, CAPTAIN, IS YOUR SUBTLE SERPENT MAD OR NOT?‚ÄÔ WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT, IT WAS JUST AS IF I‚ÄÔD GIVEN HIM A SUDDEN LASH FROM BEHIND. HE SIMPLY LEAPT UP FROM HIS SEAT. ‚ÄÒYES,‚ÄÔ SAID HE, ‚ÄÒ ‚Ä¶ YES, ONLY THAT,‚ÄÔ HE SAID, ‚ÄÒCANNOT AFFECT ‚Ä¶‚ÄÔ ‚ÄÒAFFECT WHAT?‚ÄÔ HE DIDN‚ÄÔT FINISH. YES, AND THEN HE FELL TO THINKING SO BITTERLY, THINKING SO MUCH, THAT HIS DRUNKENNESS DROPPED OFF HIM. WE WERE SITTING IN FILIPOV‚ÄÔS RESTAURANT. AND IT WASN‚ÄÔT TILL HALF AN HOUR LATER THAT HE SUDDENLY STRUCK THE TABLE WITH HIS FIST. ‚ÄÒYES,‚ÄÔ SAID HE, ‚ÄÒMAYBE HE‚ÄÔS MAD, BUT THAT CAN‚ÄÔT AFFECT IT.‚Ä¶‚ÄÔ AGAIN HE DIDN‚ÄÔT SAY WHAT IT COULDN‚ÄÔT AFFECT. OF COURSE I‚ÄÔM ONLY GIVING YOU AN EXTRACT OF THE CONVERSATION, BUT ONE CAN UNDERSTAND THE SENSE OF IT. YOU MAY ASK WHOM YOU LIKE, THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME IDEA IN THEIR HEADS, THOUGH IT NEVER ENTERED ANYONE‚ÄÔS HEAD BEFORE. ‚ÄÒYES,‚ÄÔ THEY SAY, ‚ÄÒHE‚ÄÔS MAD; HE‚ÄÔS VERY CLEVER, BUT PERHAPS HE‚ÄÔS MAD TOO.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SAT PONDERING, AND THOUGHT INTENTLY.

‚ÄÚAND HOW DOES LEBYADKIN KNOW?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDO YOU MIND INQUIRING ABOUT THAT OF ALEXEY NILITCH, WHO HAS JUST CALLED ME A SPY? I‚ÄÔM A SPY, YET I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW, BUT ALEXEY NILITCH KNOWS ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF IT, AND HOLDS HIS TONGUE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT, OR HARDLY ANYTHING,‚ÄÙ ANSWERED THE ENGINEER WITH THE SAME IRRITATION. ‚ÄÚYOU MAKE LEBYADKIN DRUNK TO FIND OUT. YOU BROUGHT ME HERE TO FIND OUT AND TO MAKE ME SAY. AND SO YOU MUST BE A SPY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI HAVEN‚ÄÔT MADE HIM DRUNK YET, AND HE‚ÄÔS NOT WORTH THE MONEY EITHER, WITH ALL HIS SECRETS. THEY ARE NOT WORTH THAT TO ME. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TO YOU. ON THE CONTRARY, HE IS SCATTERING THE MONEY, THOUGH TWELVE DAYS AGO HE BEGGED FIFTEEN KOPECKS OF ME, AND IT‚ÄÔS HE TREATS ME TO CHAMPAGNE, NOT I HIM. BUT YOU‚ÄÔVE GIVEN ME AN IDEA, AND IF THERE SHOULD BE OCCASION I WILL MAKE HIM DRUNK, JUST TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AND MAYBE I SHALL FIND OUT ‚Ä¶ ALL YOUR LITTLE SECRETS,‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN SNAPPED BACK SPITEFULLY.

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH LOOKED IN BEWILDERMENT AT THE TWO DISPUTANTS. BOTH WERE GIVING THEMSELVES AWAY, AND WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, WERE NOT STANDING ON CEREMONY. THE THOUGHT CROSSED MY MIND THAT LIPUTIN HAD BROUGHT THIS ALEXEY NILITCH TO US WITH THE SIMPLE OBJECT OF DRAWING HIM INTO A CONVERSATION THROUGH A THIRD PERSON FOR PURPOSES OF HIS OWN‚ÄÎHIS FAVOURITE MAN≈ÌUVRE.

‚ÄÚALEXEY NILITCH KNOWS NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH QUITE WELL,‚ÄÙ HE WENT ON, IRRITABLY, ‚ÄÚONLY HE CONCEALS IT. AND AS TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN, HE MADE HIS ACQUAINTANCE BEFORE ANY OF US DID, SIX YEARS AGO IN PETERSBURG, IN THAT OBSCURE, IF ONE MAY SO EXPRESS IT, EPOCH IN THE LIFE OF NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, BEFORE HE HAD DREAMED OF REJOICING OUR HEARTS BY COMING HERE. OUR PRINCE, ONE MUST CONCLUDE, SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH RATHER A QUEER SELECTION OF ACQUAINTANCES. IT WAS AT THAT TIME, IT SEEMS, THAT HE MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS GENTLEMAN HERE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTAKE CARE, LIPUTIN. I WARN YOU, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH MEANT TO BE HERE SOON HIMSELF, AND HE KNOWS HOW TO DEFEND HIMSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY WARN ME? I AM THE FIRST TO CRY OUT THAT HE IS A MAN OF THE MOST SUBTLE AND REFINED INTELLIGENCE, AND I QUITE REASSURED VARVARA PETROVNA YESTERDAY ON THAT SCORE. ‚ÄÒIT‚ÄÔS HIS CHARACTER,‚ÄÔ I SAID TO HER, ‚ÄÒTHAT I CAN‚ÄÔT ANSWER FOR.‚ÄÔ LEBYADKIN SAID THE SAME THING YESTERDAY: ‚ÄÒA LOT OF HARM HAS COME TO ME FROM HIS CHARACTER,‚ÄÔ HE SAID. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, IT‚ÄÔS ALL VERY WELL FOR YOU TO CRY OUT ABOUT SLANDER AND SPYING, AND AT THE VERY TIME OBSERVE THAT YOU WRING IT ALL OUT OF ME, AND WITH SUCH IMMENSE CURIOSITY TOO. NOW, VARVARA PETROVNA WENT STRAIGHT TO THE POINT YESTERDAY. ‚ÄÒYOU HAVE HAD A PERSONAL INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS,‚ÄÔ SHE SAID, ‚ÄÒTHAT‚ÄÔS WHY I APPEAL TO YOU.‚ÄÔ I SHOULD SAY SO! WHAT NEED TO LOOK FOR MOTIVES WHEN I‚ÄÔVE SWALLOWED A PERSONAL INSULT FROM HIS EXCELLENCY BEFORE THE WHOLE SOCIETY OF THE PLACE. I SHOULD THINK I HAVE GROUNDS TO BE INTERESTED, NOT MERELY FOR THE SAKE OF GOSSIP. HE SHAKES HANDS WITH YOU ONE DAY, AND NEXT DAY, FOR NO EARTHLY REASON, HE RETURNS YOUR HOSPITALITY BY SLAPPING YOU ON THE CHEEKS IN THE FACE OF ALL DECENT SOCIETY, IF THE FANCY TAKES HIM, OUT OF SHEER WANTONNESS. AND WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, THE FAIR SEX IS EVERYTHING FOR THEM, THESE BUTTERFLIES AND METTLESOME COCKS! GRAND GENTLEMEN WITH LITTLE WINGS LIKE THE ANCIENT CUPIDS, LADY-KILLING PETCHORINS! IT‚ÄÔS ALL VERY WELL FOR YOU, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, A CONFIRMED BACHELOR, TO TALK LIKE THAT, STICK UP FOR HIS EXCELLENCY AND CALL ME A SLANDERER. BUT IF YOU MARRIED A PRETTY YOUNG WIFE‚ÄÎAS YOU‚ÄÔRE STILL SUCH A FINE FELLOW‚ÄÎTHEN I DARE SAY YOU‚ÄÔD BOLT YOUR DOOR AGAINST OUR PRINCE, AND THROW UP BARRICADES IN YOUR HOUSE! WHY, IF ONLY THAT MADEMOISELLE LEBYADKIN, WHO IS THRASHED WITH A WHIP, WERE NOT MAD AND BANDY-LEGGED, BY JOVE, I SHOULD FANCY SHE WAS THE VICTIM OF THE PASSIONS OF OUR GENERAL, AND THAT IT WAS FROM HIM THAT CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN HAD SUFFERED ‚ÄÒIN HIS FAMILY DIGNITY,‚ÄÔ AS HE EXPRESSES IT HIMSELF. ONLY PERHAPS THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH HIS REFINED TASTE, THOUGH, INDEED, EVEN THAT‚ÄÔS NO HINDRANCE TO HIM. EVERY BERRY IS WORTH PICKING IF ONLY HE‚ÄÔS IN THE MOOD FOR IT. YOU TALK OF SLANDER, BUT I‚ÄÔM NOT CRYING THIS ALOUD THOUGH THE WHOLE TOWN IS RINGING WITH IT; I ONLY LISTEN AND ASSENT. THAT‚ÄÔS NOT PROHIBITED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE TOWN‚ÄÔS RINGING WITH IT? WHAT‚ÄÔS THE TOWN RINGING WITH?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT IS, CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN IS SHOUTING FOR ALL THE TOWN TO HEAR, AND ISN‚ÄÔT THAT JUST THE SAME AS THE MARKET-PLACE RINGING WITH IT? HOW AM I TO BLAME? I INTEREST MYSELF IN IT ONLY AMONG FRIENDS, FOR, AFTER ALL, I CONSIDER MYSELF AMONG FRIENDS HERE.‚ÄÙ HE LOOKED AT US WITH AN INNOCENT AIR. ‚ÄÚSOMETHING‚ÄÔS HAPPENED, ONLY CONSIDER: THEY SAY HIS EXCELLENCY HAS SENT THREE HUNDRED ROUBLES FROM SWITZERLAND BY A MOST HONOURABLE YOUNG LADY, AND, SO TO SAY, MODEST ORPHAN, WHOM I HAVE THE HONOUR OF KNOWING, TO BE HANDED OVER TO CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN. AND LEBYADKIN, A LITTLE LATER, WAS TOLD AS AN ABSOLUTE FACT ALSO BY A VERY HONOURABLE AND THEREFORE TRUSTWORTHY PERSON, I WON‚ÄÔT SAY WHOM, THAT NOT THREE HUNDRED BUT A THOUSAND ROUBLES HAD BEEN SENT!‚Ä¶ AND SO, LEBYADKIN KEEPS CRYING OUT ‚ÄÒTHE YOUNG LADY HAS GRABBED SEVEN HUNDRED ROUBLES BELONGING TO ME,‚ÄÔ AND HE‚ÄÔS ALMOST READY TO CALL IN THE POLICE; HE THREATENS TO, ANYWAY, AND HE‚ÄÔS MAKING AN UPROAR ALL OVER THE TOWN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHIS IS VILE, VILE OF YOU!‚ÄÙ CRIED THE ENGINEER, LEAPING UP SUDDENLY FROM HIS CHAIR.

‚ÄÚBUT I SAY, YOU ARE YOURSELF THE HONOURABLE PERSON WHO BROUGHT WORD TO LEBYADKIN FROM NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH THAT A THOUSAND ROUBLES WERE SENT, NOT THREE HUNDRED. WHY, THE CAPTAIN TOLD ME SO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS DRUNK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS ‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS AN UNHAPPY MISUNDERSTANDING. SOME ONE‚ÄÔS MADE A MISTAKE AND IT‚ÄÔS LED TO ‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS NONSENSE, AND IT‚ÄÔS BASE OF YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT I‚ÄÔM READY TO BELIEVE THAT IT‚ÄÔS NONSENSE, AND I‚ÄÔM DISTRESSED AT THE STORY, FOR, TAKE IT AS YOU WILL, A GIRL OF AN HONOURABLE REPUTATION IS IMPLICATED FIRST OVER THE SEVEN HUNDRED ROUBLES, AND SECONDLY IN UNMISTAKABLE INTIMACY WITH NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH. FOR HOW MUCH DOES IT MEAN TO HIS EXCELLENCY TO DISGRACE A GIRL OF GOOD CHARACTER, OR PUT TO SHAME ANOTHER MAN‚ÄÔS WIFE, LIKE THAT INCIDENT WITH ME? IF HE COMES ACROSS A GENEROUS-HEARTED MAN HE‚ÄÔLL FORCE HIM TO COVER THE SINS OF OTHERS UNDER THE SHELTER OF HIS HONOURABLE NAME. THAT‚ÄÔS JUST WHAT I HAD TO PUT UP WITH, I‚ÄÔM SPEAKING OF MYSELF.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBE CAREFUL, LIPUTIN.‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH GOT UP FROM HIS EASY CHAIR AND TURNED PALE.

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE IT, DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE IT! SOMEBODY HAS MADE A MISTAKE AND LEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS DRUNK ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ EXCLAIMED THE ENGINEER IN INDESCRIBABLE EXCITEMENT. ‚ÄÚIT WILL ALL BE EXPLAINED, BUT I CAN‚ÄÔT.‚Ä¶ AND I THINK IT‚ÄÔS LOW.‚Ä¶ AND THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH, ENOUGH!‚ÄÙ

HE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM.

‚ÄÚWHAT ARE YOU ABOUT? WHY, I‚ÄÔM GOING WITH YOU!‚ÄÙ CRIED LIPUTIN, STARTLED. HE JUMPED UP AND RAN AFTER ALEXEY NILITCH.

VII

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH STOOD A MOMENT REFLECTING, LOOKED AT ME AS THOUGH HE DID NOT SEE ME, TOOK UP HIS HAT AND STICK AND WALKED QUIETLY OUT OF THE ROOM. I FOLLOWED HIM AGAIN, AS BEFORE. AS WE WENT OUT OF THE GATE, NOTICING THAT I WAS ACCOMPANYING HIM, HE SAID:

‚ÄÚOH YES, YOU MAY SERVE AS A WITNESS ‚Ä¶ DE L‚ÄÔACCIDENT. VOUS M‚ÄÔACCOMPAGNEREZ, N‚ÄÔEST-CE PAS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSTEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, SURELY YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT GOING THERE AGAIN? THINK WHAT MAY COME OF IT!‚ÄÙ

WITH A PITIFUL AND DISTRACTED SMILE, A SMILE OF SHAME AND UTTER DESPAIR, AND AT THE SAME TIME OF A SORT OF STRANGE ECSTASY, HE WHISPERED TO ME, STANDING STILL FOR AN INSTANT:

‚ÄÚI CAN‚ÄÔT MARRY TO COVER ‚ÄÒANOTHER MAN‚ÄÔS SINS‚ÄÔ!‚ÄÙ

THESE WORDS WERE JUST WHAT I WAS EXPECTING. AT LAST THAT FATAL SENTENCE THAT HE HAD KEPT HIDDEN FROM ME WAS UTTERED ALOUD, AFTER A WHOLE WEEK OF SHUFFLING AND PRETENCE. I WAS POSITIVELY ENRAGED.

‚ÄÚAND YOU, STEPAN VERHOVENSKY, WITH YOUR LUMINOUS MIND, YOUR KIND HEART, CAN HARBOUR SUCH A DIRTY, SUCH A LOW IDEA ‚Ä¶ AND COULD BEFORE LIPUTIN CAME!‚ÄÙ

HE LOOKED AT ME, MADE NO ANSWER AND WALKED ON IN THE SAME DIRECTION. I DID NOT WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND. I WANTED TO GIVE VARVARA PETROVNA MY VERSION. I COULD HAVE FORGIVEN HIM IF HE HAD SIMPLY WITH HIS WOMANISH FAINT-HEARTEDNESS BELIEVED LIPUTIN, BUT NOW IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE HAD THOUGHT OF IT ALL HIMSELF LONG BEFORE, AND THAT LIPUTIN HAD ONLY CONFIRMED HIS SUSPICIONS AND POURED OIL ON THE FLAMES. HE HAD NOT HESITATED TO SUSPECT THE GIRL FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY, BEFORE HE HAD ANY KIND OF GROUNDS, EVEN LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS WORDS, TO GO UPON. VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS DESPOTIC BEHAVIOUR HE HAD EXPLAINED TO HIMSELF AS DUE TO HER HASTE TO COVER UP THE ARISTOCRATIC MISDOINGS OF HER PRECIOUS ‚ÄÚNICOLAS‚ÄÙ BY MARRYING THE GIRL TO AN HONOURABLE MAN! I LONGED FOR HIM TO BE PUNISHED FOR IT.

‚ÄÚOH, DIEU, QUI EST SI GRAND ET SI BON! OH, WHO WILL COMFORT ME!‚ÄÙ HE EXCLAIMED, HALTING SUDDENLY AGAIN, AFTER WALKING A HUNDRED PACES.

‚ÄÚCOME STRAIGHT HOME AND I‚ÄÔLL MAKE EVERYTHING CLEAR TO YOU,‚ÄÙ I CRIED, TURNING HIM BY FORCE TOWARDS HOME.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS HE! STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, IT‚ÄÔS YOU? YOU?‚ÄÙ A FRESH, JOYOUS YOUNG VOICE RANG OUT LIKE MUSIC BEHIND US.

WE HAD SEEN NOTHING, BUT A LADY ON HORSEBACK SUDDENLY MADE HER APPEARANCE BESIDE US‚ÄÎLIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA WITH HER INVARIABLE COMPANION. SHE PULLED UP HER HORSE.

‚ÄÚCOME HERE, COME HERE QUICKLY!‚ÄÙ SHE CALLED TO US, LOUDLY AND MERRILY. ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS TWELVE YEARS SINCE I‚ÄÔVE SEEN HIM, AND I KNOW HIM, WHILE HE.‚Ä¶ DO YOU REALLY NOT KNOW ME?‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH CLASPED THE HAND HELD OUT TO HIM AND KISSED IT REVERENTLY. HE GAZED AT HER AS THOUGH HE WERE PRAYING AND COULD NOT UTTER A WORD.

‚ÄÚHE KNOWS ME, AND IS GLAD! MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, HE‚ÄÔS DELIGHTED TO SEE ME! WHY IS IT YOU HAVEN‚ÄÔT BEEN TO SEE US ALL THIS FORTNIGHT? AUNTIE TRIED TO PERSUADE ME YOU WERE ILL AND MUST NOT BE DISTURBED; BUT I KNOW AUNTIE TELLS LIES. I KEPT STAMPING AND SWEARING AT YOU, BUT I HAD MADE UP MY MIND, QUITE MADE UP MY MIND, THAT YOU SHOULD COME TO ME FIRST, THAT WAS WHY I DIDN‚ÄÔT SEND TO YOU. HEAVENS, WHY HE HASN‚ÄÔT CHANGED A BIT!‚ÄÙ SHE SCRUTINISED HIM, BENDING DOWN FROM THE SADDLE. ‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS ABSURDLY UNCHANGED. OH, YES, HE HAS WRINKLES, A LOT OF WRINKLES, ROUND HIS EYES AND ON HIS CHEEKS SOME GREY HAIR, BUT HIS EYES ARE JUST THE SAME. AND HAVE I CHANGED? HAVE I CHANGED? WHY DON‚ÄÔT YOU SAY SOMETHING?‚ÄÙ

I REMEMBERED AT THAT MOMENT THE STORY THAT SHE HAD BEEN ALMOST ILL WHEN SHE WAS TAKEN AWAY TO PETERSBURG AT ELEVEN YEARS OLD, AND THAT SHE HAD CRIED DURING HER ILLNESS AND ASKED FOR STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.

‚ÄÚYOU ‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HE FALTERED NOW IN A VOICE BREAKING WITH JOY. ‚ÄÚI WAS JUST CRYING OUT ‚ÄÒWHO WILL COMFORT ME?‚ÄÔ AND I HEARD YOUR VOICE. I LOOK ON IT AS A MIRACLE ET JE COMMENCE √† CROIRE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEN DIEU! EN DIEU QUI EST L√†-HAUT ET QUI EST SI GRAND ET SI BON! YOU SEE, I KNOW ALL YOUR LECTURES BY HEART. MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, WHAT FAITH HE USED TO PREACH TO ME THEN, EN DIEU QUI EST SI GRAND ET SI BON! AND DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR STORY OF HOW COLUMBUS DISCOVERED AMERICA, AND THEY ALL CRIED OUT, ‚ÄÒLAND! LAND!‚ÄÔ? MY NURSE ALYONA FROLOVNA SAYS I WAS LIGHT-HEADED AT NIGHT AFTERWARDS, AND KEPT CRYING OUT ‚ÄÒLAND! LAND!‚ÄÔ IN MY SLEEP. AND DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU TOLD ME THE STORY OF PRINCE HAMLET? AND DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU DESCRIBED TO ME HOW THE POOR EMIGRANTS WERE TRANSPORTED FROM EUROPE TO AMERICA? AND IT WAS ALL UNTRUE; I FOUND OUT AFTERWARDS HOW THEY WERE TRANSITED. BUT WHAT BEAUTIFUL FIBS HE USED TO TELL ME THEN, MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH! THEY WERE BETTER THAN THE TRUTH. WHY DO YOU LOOK AT MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH LIKE THAT? HE IS THE BEST AND FINEST MAN ON THE FACE OF THE GLOBE AND YOU MUST LIKE HIM JUST AS YOU DO ME! IL FAIT TOUT CE QUE JE VEUX. BUT, DEAR STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, YOU MUST BE UNHAPPY AGAIN, SINCE YOU CRY OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET ASKING WHO WILL COMFORT YOU. UNHAPPY, AREN‚ÄÔT YOU? AREN‚ÄÔT YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOW I‚ÄÔM HAPPY.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAUNT IS HORRID TO YOU?‚ÄÙ SHE WENT ON, WITHOUT LISTENING. ‚ÄÚSHE‚ÄÔS JUST THE SAME AS EVER, CROSS, UNJUST, AND ALWAYS OUR PRECIOUS AUNT! AND DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU THREW YOURSELF INTO MY ARMS IN THE GARDEN AND I COMFORTED YOU AND CRIED‚ÄÎDON‚ÄÔT BE AFRAID OF MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH; HE HAS KNOWN ALL ABOUT YOU, EVERYTHING, FOR EVER SO LONG; YOU CAN WEEP ON HIS SHOULDER AS LONG AS YOU LIKE, AND HE‚ÄÔLL STAND THERE AS LONG AS YOU LIKE! ‚Ä¶ LIFT UP YOUR HAT, TAKE IT OFF ALTOGETHER FOR A MINUTE, LIFT UP YOUR HEAD, STAND ON TIPTOE, I WANT TO KISS YOU ON THE FOREHEAD AS I KISSED YOU FOR THE LAST TIME WHEN WE PARTED. DO YOU SEE THAT YOUNG LADY‚ÄÔS ADMIRING US OUT OF THE WINDOW? COME CLOSER, CLOSER! HEAVENS! HOW GREY HE IS!‚ÄÙ

AND BENDING OVER IN THE SADDLE SHE KISSED HIM ON THE FOREHEAD.

‚ÄÚCOME, NOW TO YOUR HOME! I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE. I‚ÄÔLL BE WITH YOU DIRECTLY, IN A MINUTE. I‚ÄÔLL MAKE YOU THE FIRST VISIT, YOU STUBBORN MAN, AND THEN I MUST HAVE YOU FOR A WHOLE DAY AT HOME. YOU CAN GO AND MAKE READY FOR ME.‚ÄÙ

AND SHE GALLOPED OFF WITH HER CAVALIER. WE RETURNED. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SAT DOWN ON THE SOFA AND BEGAN TO CRY.

‚ÄÚDIEU, DIEU.‚ÄÙ HE EXCLAIMED, ‚ÄÚENFIN UNE MINUTE DE BONHEUR!‚ÄÙ

NOT MORE THAN TEN MINUTES AFTERWARDS SHE REAPPEARED ACCORDING TO HER PROMISE, ESCORTED BY HER MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH.

‚ÄÚVOUS ET LE BONHEUR, VOUS ARRIVEZ EN M√™ME TEMPS!‚ÄÙ HE GOT UP TO MEET HER.

‚ÄÚHERE‚ÄÔS A NOSEGAY FOR YOU; I RODE JUST NOW TO MADAME CHEVALIER‚ÄÔS, SHE HAS FLOWERS ALL THE WINTER FOR NAME-DAYS. HERE‚ÄÔS MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, PLEASE MAKE FRIENDS. I WANTED TO BRING YOU A CAKE INSTEAD OF A NOSEGAY, BUT MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH DECLARES THAT IS NOT IN THE RUSSIAN SPIRIT.‚ÄÙ

MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH WAS AN ARTILLERY CAPTAIN, A TALL AND HANDSOME MAN OF THIRTY-THREE, IRREPROACHABLY CORRECT IN APPEARANCE, WITH AN IMPOSING AND AT FIRST SIGHT ALMOST STERN COUNTENANCE, IN SPITE OF HIS WONDERFUL AND DELICATE KINDNESS WHICH NO ONE COULD FAIL TO PERCEIVE ALMOST THE FIRST MOMENT OF MAKING HIS ACQUAINTANCE. HE WAS TACITURN, HOWEVER, SEEMED VERY SELF-POSSESSED AND MADE NO EFFORTS TO GAIN FRIENDS. MANY OF US SAID LATER THAT HE WAS BY NO MEANS CLEVER; BUT THIS WAS NOT ALTOGETHER JUST.

I WON‚ÄÔT ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE THE BEAUTY OF LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA. THE WHOLE TOWN WAS TALKING OF IT, THOUGH SOME OF OUR LADIES AND YOUNG GIRLS INDIGNANTLY DIFFERED ON THE SUBJECT. THERE WERE SOME AMONG THEM WHO ALREADY DETESTED HER, AND PRINCIPALLY FOR HER PRIDE. THE DROZDOVS HAD SCARCELY BEGUN TO PAY CALLS, WHICH MORTIFIED THEM, THOUGH THE REAL REASON FOR THE DELAY WAS PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA‚ÄÔS INVALID STATE. THEY DETESTED HER IN THE SECOND PLACE BECAUSE SHE WAS A RELATIVE OF THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE, AND THIRDLY BECAUSE SHE RODE OUT EVERY DAY ON HORSEBACK. WE HAD NEVER HAD YOUNG LADIES WHO RODE ON HORSEBACK BEFORE; IT WAS ONLY NATURAL THAT THE APPEARANCE OF LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA ON HORSEBACK AND HER NEGLECT TO PAY CALLS WAS BOUND TO OFFEND LOCAL SOCIETY. YET EVERY ONE KNEW THAT RIDING WAS PRESCRIBED HER BY THE DOCTOR‚ÄÔS ORDERS, AND THEY TALKED SARCASTICALLY OF HER ILLNESS. SHE REALLY WAS ILL. WHAT STRUCK ME AT FIRST SIGHT IN HER WAS HER ABNORMAL, NERVOUS, INCESSANT RESTLESSNESS. ALAS, THE POOR GIRL WAS VERY UNHAPPY, AND EVERYTHING WAS EXPLAINED LATER. TO-DAY, RECALLING THE PAST, I SHOULD NOT SAY SHE WAS SUCH A BEAUTY AS SHE SEEMED TO ME THEN. PERHAPS SHE WAS REALLY NOT PRETTY AT ALL. TALL, SLIM, BUT STRONG AND SUPPLE, SHE STRUCK ONE BY THE IRREGULARITIES OF THE LINES OF HER FACE. HER EYES WERE SET SOMEWHAT LIKE A KALMUCK‚ÄÔS, SLANTING; SHE WAS PALE AND THIN IN THE FACE WITH HIGH CHEEK-BONES, BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE FACE THAT CONQUERED AND FASCINATED! THERE WAS SOMETHING POWERFUL IN THE ARDENT GLANCE OF HER DARK EYES. SHE ALWAYS MADE HER APPEARANCE ‚ÄÚLIKE A CONQUERING HEROINE, AND TO SPREAD HER CONQUESTS.‚ÄÙ SHE SEEMED PROUD AND AT TIMES EVEN ARROGANT. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHETHER SHE SUCCEEDED IN BEING KIND, BUT I KNOW THAT SHE WANTED TO, AND MADE TERRIBLE EFFORTS TO FORCE HERSELF TO BE A LITTLE KIND. THERE WERE, NO DOUBT, MANY FINE IMPULSES AND THE VERY BEST ELEMENTS IN HER CHARACTER, BUT EVERYTHING IN HER SEEMED PERPETUALLY SEEKING ITS BALANCE AND UNABLE TO FIND IT; EVERYTHING WAS IN CHAOS, IN AGITATION, IN UNEASINESS. PERHAPS THE DEMANDS SHE MADE UPON HERSELF WERE TOO SEVERE, AND SHE WAS NEVER ABLE TO FIND IN HERSELF THE STRENGTH TO SATISFY THEM.

SHE SAT ON THE SOFA AND LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM.

‚ÄÚWHY DO I ALWAYS BEGIN TO FEEL SAD AT SUCH MOMENTS; EXPLAIN THAT MYSTERY, YOU LEARNED PERSON? I‚ÄÔVE BEEN THINKING ALL MY LIFE THAT I SHOULD BE GOODNESS KNOWS HOW PLEASED AT SEEING YOU AND RECALLING EVERYTHING, AND HERE I SOMEHOW DON‚ÄÔT FEEL PLEASED AT ALL, ALTHOUGH I DO LOVE YOU.‚Ä¶ ACH, HEAVENS! HE HAS MY PORTRAIT ON THE WALL! GIVE IT HERE. I REMEMBER IT! I REMEMBER IT!‚ÄÙ

AN EXQUISITE MINIATURE IN WATER-COLOUR OF LIZA AT TWELVE YEARS OLD HAD BEEN SENT NINE YEARS BEFORE TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH FROM PETERSBURG BY THE DROZDOVS. HE HAD KEPT IT HANGING ON HIS WALL EVER SINCE.

‚ÄÚWAS I SUCH A PRETTY CHILD? CAN THAT REALLY HAVE BEEN MY FACE?‚ÄÙ

SHE STOOD UP, AND WITH THE PORTRAIT IN HER HAND LOOKED IN THE LOOKING-GLASS.

‚ÄÚMAKE HASTE, TAKE IT!‚ÄÙ SHE CRIED, GIVING BACK THE PORTRAIT. ‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT HANG IT UP NOW, AFTERWARDS. I DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO LOOK AT IT.‚ÄÙ

SHE SAT DOWN ON THE SOFA AGAIN. ‚ÄÚONE LIFE IS OVER AND ANOTHER IS BEGUN, THEN THAT ONE IS OVER‚ÄÎA THIRD BEGINS, AND SO ON, ENDLESSLY. ALL THE ENDS ARE SNIPPED OFF AS IT WERE WITH SCISSORS. SEE WHAT STALE THINGS I‚ÄÔM TELLING YOU. YET HOW MUCH TRUTH THERE IS IN THEM!‚ÄÙ

SHE LOOKED AT ME, SMILING; SHE HAD GLANCED AT ME SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY, BUT IN HIS EXCITEMENT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH FORGOT THAT HE HAD PROMISED TO INTRODUCE ME.

‚ÄÚAND WHY HAVE YOU HUNG MY PORTRAIT UNDER THOSE DAGGERS? AND WHY HAVE YOU GOT SO MANY DAGGERS AND SABRES?‚ÄÙ

HE HAD AS A FACT HANGING ON THE WALL, I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHY, TWO CROSSED DAGGERS AND ABOVE THEM A GENUINE CIRCASSIAN SABRE. AS SHE ASKED THIS QUESTION SHE LOOKED SO DIRECTLY AT ME THAT I WANTED TO ANSWER, BUT HESITATED TO SPEAK. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH GRASPED THE POSITION AT LAST AND INTRODUCED ME.

‚ÄÚI KNOW, I KNOW,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID, ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM DELIGHTED TO MEET YOU. MOTHER HAS HEARD A GREAT DEAL ABOUT YOU, TOO. LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH TOO, HE‚ÄÔS A SPLENDID PERSON. I HAD FORMED A FUNNY NOTION OF YOU ALREADY. YOU‚ÄÔRE STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS CONFIDANT, AREN‚ÄÔT YOU?‚ÄÙ

I TURNED RATHER RED.

‚ÄÚACH, FORGIVE ME, PLEASE. I USED QUITE THE WRONG WORD: NOT FUNNY AT ALL, BUT ONLY ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ SHE WAS CONFUSED AND BLUSHED. ‚ÄÚWHY BE ASHAMED THOUGH AT YOUR BEING A SPLENDID PERSON? WELL, IT‚ÄÔS TIME WE WERE GOING, MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH! STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, YOU MUST BE WITH US IN HALF AN HOUR. MERCY, WHAT A LOT WE SHALL TALK! NOW I‚ÄÔM YOUR CONFIDANTE, AND ABOUT EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING, YOU UNDERSTAND?‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS ALARMED AT ONCE.

‚ÄÚOH, MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH KNOWS EVERYTHING, DON‚ÄÔT MIND HIM!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT DOES HE KNOW?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?‚ÄÙ SHE CRIED IN ASTONISHMENT. ‚ÄÚBAH, WHY IT‚ÄÔS TRUE THEN THAT THEY‚ÄÔRE HIDING IT! I WOULDN‚ÄÔT BELIEVE IT! AND THEY‚ÄÔRE HIDING DASHA, TOO. AUNT WOULDN‚ÄÔT LET ME GO IN TO SEE DASHA TO-DAY. SHE SAYS SHE‚ÄÔS GOT A HEADACHE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT ‚Ä¶ BUT HOW DID YOU FIND OUT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMY GOODNESS, LIKE EVERY ONE ELSE. THAT NEEDS NO CUNNING!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT DOES EVERY ONE ELSE ‚Ä¶?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, OF COURSE. MOTHER, IT‚ÄÔS TRUE, HEARD IT FIRST THROUGH ALYONA FROLOVNA, MY NURSE; YOUR NASTASYA RAN ROUND TO TELL HER. YOU TOLD NASTASYA, DIDN‚ÄÔT YOU? SHE SAYS YOU TOLD HER YOURSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI ‚Ä¶ I DID ONCE SPEAK,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH FALTERED, CRIMSONING ALL OVER, ‚ÄÚBUT ‚Ä¶ I ONLY HINTED ‚Ä¶ J‚ÄÔ√©TAIS SI NERVEUX ET MALADE, ET PUIS ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

SHE LAUGHED.

‚ÄÚAND YOUR CONFIDANT DIDN‚ÄÔT HAPPEN TO BE AT HAND, AND NASTASYA TURNED UP. WELL THAT WAS ENOUGH! AND THE WHOLE TOWN‚ÄÔS FULL OF HER CRONIES! COME, IT DOESN‚ÄÔT MATTER, LET THEM KNOW; IT‚ÄÔS ALL THE BETTER. MAKE HASTE AND COME TO US, WE DINE EARLY.‚Ä¶ OH, I FORGOT,‚ÄÙ SHE ADDED, SITTING DOWN AGAIN; ‚ÄÚLISTEN, WHAT SORT OF PERSON IS SHATOV?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSHATOV? HE‚ÄÔS THE BROTHER OF DARYA PAVLOVNA.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNOW HE‚ÄÔS HER BROTHER! WHAT A PERSON YOU ARE, REALLY,‚ÄÙ SHE INTERRUPTED IMPATIENTLY. ‚ÄÚI WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE‚ÄÔS LIKE; WHAT SORT OF MAN HE IS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚC‚ÄÔEST UN PENSE-CREUX D‚ÄÔICI. C‚ÄÔEST LE MEILLEUR ET LE PLUS IRASCIBLE HOMME DU MONDE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE HEARD THAT HE‚ÄÔS RATHER QUEER. BUT THAT WASN‚ÄÔT WHAT I MEANT. I‚ÄÔVE HEARD THAT HE KNOWS THREE LANGUAGES, ONE OF THEM ENGLISH, AND CAN DO LITERARY WORK. IN THAT CASE I‚ÄÔVE A LOT OF WORK FOR HIM. I WANT SOMEONE TO HELP ME AND THE SOONER THE BETTER. WOULD HE TAKE THE WORK OR NOT? HE‚ÄÔS BEEN RECOMMENDED TO ME.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, MOST CERTAINLY HE WILL. ET VOUS FEREZ UN BIENFAIT.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM NOT DOING IT AS A BIENFAIT. I NEED SOMEONE TO HELP ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNOW SHATOV PRETTY WELL,‚ÄÙ I SAID, ‚ÄÚAND IF YOU WILL TRUST ME WITH A MESSAGE TO HIM I‚ÄÔLL GO TO HIM THIS MINUTE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTELL HIM TO COME TO ME AT TWELVE O‚ÄÔCLOCK TO-MORROW MORNING. CAPITAL! THANK YOU. MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, ARE YOU READY?‚ÄÙ

THEY WENT AWAY. I RAN AT ONCE, OF COURSE, TO SHATOV.

‚ÄÚMON AMI!‚ÄÙ SAID STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, OVERTAKING ME ON THE STEPS. ‚ÄÚBE SURE TO BE AT MY LODGING AT TEN OR ELEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK WHEN I COME BACK. OH, I‚ÄÔVE ACTED VERY WRONGLY IN MY CONDUCT TO YOU AND TO EVERY ONE.‚ÄÙ

VIII

I DID NOT FIND SHATOV AT HOME. I RAN ROUND AGAIN, TWO HOURS LATER. HE WAS STILL OUT. AT LAST, AT EIGHT O‚ÄÔCLOCK I WENT TO HIM AGAIN, MEANING TO LEAVE A NOTE IF I DID NOT FIND HIM; AGAIN I FAILED TO FIND HIM. HIS LODGING WAS SHUT UP, AND HE LIVED ALONE WITHOUT A SERVANT OF ANY SORT. I DID THINK OF KNOCKING AT CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS DOWN BELOW TO ASK ABOUT SHATOV; BUT IT WAS ALL SHUT UP BELOW, TOO, AND THERE WAS NO SOUND OR LIGHT AS THOUGH THE PLACE WERE EMPTY. I PASSED BY LEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS DOOR WITH CURIOSITY, REMEMBERING THE STORIES I HAD HEARD THAT DAY. FINALLY, I MADE UP MY MIND TO COME VERY EARLY NEXT MORNING. TO TELL THE TRUTH I DID NOT PUT MUCH CONFIDENCE IN THE EFFECT OF A NOTE. SHATOV MIGHT TAKE NO NOTICE OF IT; HE WAS SO OBSTINATE AND SHY. CURSING MY WANT OF SUCCESS, I WAS GOING OUT OF THE GATE WHEN ALL AT ONCE I STUMBLED ON MR. KIRILLOV. HE WAS GOING INTO THE HOUSE AND HE RECOGNISED ME FIRST. AS HE BEGAN QUESTIONING ME OF HIMSELF, I TOLD HIM HOW THINGS WERE, AND THAT I HAD A NOTE.

‚ÄÚLET US GO IN,‚ÄÙ SAID HE, ‚ÄÚI WILL DO EVERYTHING.‚ÄÙ

I REMEMBERED THAT LIPUTIN HAD TOLD US HE HAD TAKEN THE WOODEN LODGE IN THE YARD THAT MORNING. IN THE LODGE, WHICH WAS TOO LARGE FOR HIM, A DEAF OLD WOMAN WHO WAITED UPON HIM WAS LIVING TOO. THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE HAD MOVED INTO A NEW HOUSE IN ANOTHER STREET, WHERE HE KEPT A RESTAURANT, AND THIS OLD WOMAN, A RELATION OF HIS, I BELIEVE, WAS LEFT BEHIND TO LOOK AFTER EVERYTHING IN THE OLD HOUSE. THE ROOMS IN THE LODGE WERE FAIRLY CLEAN, THOUGH THE WALL-PAPERS WERE DIRTY. IN THE ONE WE WENT INTO THE FURNITURE WAS OF DIFFERENT SORTS, PICKED UP HERE AND THERE, AND ALL UTTERLY WORTHLESS. THERE WERE TWO CARD-TABLES, A CHEST OF DRAWERS MADE OF ELDER, A BIG DEAL TABLE THAT MUST HAVE COME FROM SOME PEASANT HUT OR KITCHEN, CHAIRS AND A SOFA WITH TRELLIS-WORK BACK AND HARD LEATHER CUSHIONS. IN ONE CORNER THERE WAS AN OLD-FASHIONED IKON, IN FRONT OF WHICH THE OLD WOMAN HAD LIGHTED A LAMP BEFORE WE CAME IN, AND ON THE WALLS HUNG TWO DINGY OIL-PAINTINGS, ONE, A PORTRAIT OF THE TSAR NIKOLAS I, PAINTED APPARENTLY BETWEEN 1820 AND 1830; THE OTHER THE PORTRAIT OF SOME BISHOP. MR. KIRILLOV LIGHTED A CANDLE AND TOOK OUT OF HIS TRUNK, WHICH STOOD NOT YET UNPACKED IN A CORNER, AN ENVELOPE, SEALING-WAX, AND A GLASS SEAL.

‚ÄÚSEAL YOUR NOTE AND ADDRESS THE ENVELOPE.‚ÄÙ

I WOULD HAVE OBJECTED THAT THIS WAS UNNECESSARY, BUT HE INSISTED. WHEN I HAD ADDRESSED THE ENVELOPE I TOOK MY CAP.

‚ÄÚI WAS THINKING YOU‚ÄÔD HAVE TEA,‚ÄÙ HE SAID. ‚ÄÚI HAVE BOUGHT TEA. WILL YOU?‚ÄÙ

I COULD NOT REFUSE. THE OLD WOMAN SOON BROUGHT IN THE TEA, THAT IS, A VERY LARGE TEA-POT OF BOILING WATER, A LITTLE TEA-POT FULL OF STRONG TEA, TWO LARGE EARTHENWARE CUPS, COARSELY DECORATED, A FANCY LOAF, AND A WHOLE DEEP SAUCER OF LUMP SUGAR.

‚ÄÚI LOVE TEA AT NIGHT,‚ÄÙ SAID HE. ‚ÄÚI WALK MUCH AND DRINK IT TILL DAYBREAK. ABROAD TEA AT NIGHT IS INCONVENIENT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU GO TO BED AT DAYBREAK?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚALWAYS; FOR A LONG WHILE. I EAT LITTLE; ALWAYS TEA. LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS SLY, BUT IMPATIENT.‚ÄÙ

I WAS SURPRISED AT HIS WANTING TO TALK; I MADE UP MY MIND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY. ‚ÄÚTHERE WERE UNPLEASANT MISUNDERSTANDINGS THIS MORNING,‚ÄÙ I OBSERVED.

HE SCOWLED.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS FOOLISHNESS; THAT‚ÄÔS GREAT NONSENSE. ALL THIS IS NONSENSE BECAUSE LEBYADKIN IS DRUNK. I DID NOT TELL LIPUTIN, BUT ONLY EXPLAINED THE NONSENSE, BECAUSE HE GOT IT ALL WRONG. LIPUTIN HAS A GREAT DEAL OF FANTASY, HE BUILT UP A MOUNTAIN OUT OF NONSENSE. I TRUSTED LIPUTIN YESTERDAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND ME TO-DAY?‚ÄÙ I SAID, LAUGHING.

‚ÄÚBUT YOU SEE, YOU KNEW ALL ABOUT IT ALREADY THIS MORNING; LIPUTIN IS WEAK OR IMPATIENT, OR MALICIOUS OR ‚Ä¶ HE‚ÄÔS ENVIOUS.‚ÄÙ

THE LAST WORD STRUCK ME.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE MENTIONED SO MANY ADJECTIVES, HOWEVER, THAT IT WOULD BE STRANGE IF ONE DIDN‚ÄÔT DESCRIBE HIM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOR ALL AT ONCE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, AND THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT LIPUTIN REALLY IS‚ÄÎHE‚ÄÔS A CHAOS. HE WAS LYING THIS MORNING WHEN HE SAID YOU WERE WRITING SOMETHING, WASN‚ÄÔT HE?

‚ÄÚWHY SHOULD HE?‚ÄÙ HE SAID, SCOWLING AGAIN AND STARING AT THE FLOOR.

I APOLOGISED, AND BEGAN ASSURING HIM THAT I WAS NOT INQUISITIVE. HE FLUSHED.

‚ÄÚHE TOLD THE TRUTH; I AM WRITING. ONLY THAT‚ÄÔS NO MATTER.‚ÄÙ

WE WERE SILENT FOR A MINUTE. HE SUDDENLY SMILED WITH THE CHILDLIKE SMILE I HAD NOTICED THAT MORNING.

‚ÄÚHE INVENTED THAT ABOUT HEADS HIMSELF OUT OF A BOOK, AND TOLD ME FIRST HIMSELF, AND UNDERSTANDS BADLY. BUT I ONLY SEEK THE CAUSES WHY MEN DARE NOT KILL THEMSELVES; THAT‚ÄÔS ALL. AND IT‚ÄÔS ALL NO MATTER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW DO YOU MEAN THEY DON‚ÄÔT DARE? ARE THERE SO FEW SUICIDES?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚVERY FEW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDO YOU REALLY THINK SO?‚ÄÙ

HE MADE NO ANSWER, GOT UP, AND BEGAN WALKING TO AND FRO LOST IN THOUGHT.

‚ÄÚWHAT IS IT RESTRAINS PEOPLE FROM SUICIDE, DO YOU THINK?‚ÄÙ I ASKED.

HE LOOKED AT ME ABSENT-MINDEDLY, AS THOUGH TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT.

‚ÄÚI ‚Ä¶ I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW MUCH YET.‚Ä¶ TWO PREJUDICES RESTRAIN THEM, TWO THINGS; ONLY TWO, ONE VERY LITTLE, THE OTHER VERY BIG.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT IS THE LITTLE THING?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPAIN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPAIN? CAN THAT BE OF IMPORTANCE AT SUCH A MOMENT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOF THE GREATEST. THERE ARE TWO SORTS: THOSE WHO KILL THEMSELVES EITHER FROM GREAT SORROW OR FROM SPITE, OR BEING MAD, OR NO MATTER WHAT ‚Ä¶ THEY DO IT SUDDENLY. THEY THINK LITTLE ABOUT THE PAIN, BUT KILL THEMSELVES SUDDENLY. BUT SOME DO IT FROM REASON‚ÄÎTHEY THINK A GREAT DEAL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, ARE THERE PEOPLE WHO DO IT FROM REASON?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚVERY MANY. IF IT WERE NOT FOR SUPERSTITION THERE WOULD BE MORE, VERY MANY, ALL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT, ALL?‚ÄÙ

HE DID NOT ANSWER.

‚ÄÚBUT AREN‚ÄÔT THERE MEANS OF DYING WITHOUT PAIN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIMAGINE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHE STOPPED BEFORE ME‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚIMAGINE A STONE AS BIG AS A GREAT HOUSE; IT HANGS AND YOU ARE UNDER IT; IF IT FALLS ON YOU, ON YOUR HEAD, WILL IT HURT YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚA STONE AS BIG AS A HOUSE? OF COURSE IT WOULD BE FEARFUL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SPEAK NOT OF THE FEAR. WILL IT HURT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚA STONE AS BIG AS A MOUNTAIN, WEIGHING MILLIONS OF TONS? OF COURSE IT WOULDN‚ÄÔT HURT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT REALLY STAND THERE AND WHILE IT HANGS YOU WILL FEAR VERY MUCH THAT IT WILL HURT. THE MOST LEARNED MAN, THE GREATEST DOCTOR, ALL, ALL WILL BE VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED. EVERY ONE WILL KNOW THAT IT WON‚ÄÔT HURT, AND EVERY ONE WILL BE AFRAID THAT IT WILL HURT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, AND THE SECOND CAUSE, THE BIG ONE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE OTHER WORLD!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU MEAN PUNISHMENT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS NO MATTER. THE OTHER WORLD; ONLY THE OTHER WORLD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚARE THERE NO ATHEISTS, SUCH AS DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE IN THE OTHER WORLD AT ALL?‚ÄÙ

AGAIN HE DID NOT ANSWER.

‚ÄÚYOU JUDGE FROM YOURSELF, PERHAPS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEVERY ONE CANNOT JUDGE EXCEPT FROM HIMSELF,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, REDDENING. ‚ÄÚTHERE WILL BE FULL FREEDOM WHEN IT WILL BE JUST THE SAME TO LIVE OR NOT TO LIVE. THAT‚ÄÔS THE GOAL FOR ALL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE GOAL? BUT PERHAPS NO ONE WILL CARE TO LIVE THEN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO ONE,‚ÄÙ HE PRONOUNCED WITH DECISION.

‚ÄÚMAN FEARS DEATH BECAUSE HE LOVES LIFE. THAT‚ÄÔS HOW I UNDERSTAND IT,‚ÄÙ I OBSERVED, ‚ÄÚAND THAT‚ÄÔS DETERMINED BY NATURE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS ABJECT; AND THAT‚ÄÔS WHERE THE DECEPTION COMES IN.‚ÄÙ HIS EYES FLASHED. ‚ÄÚLIFE IS PAIN, LIFE IS TERROR, AND MAN IS UNHAPPY. NOW ALL IS PAIN AND TERROR. NOW MAN LOVES LIFE, BECAUSE HE LOVES PAIN AND TERROR, AND SO THEY HAVE DONE ACCORDING. LIFE IS GIVEN NOW FOR PAIN AND TERROR, AND THAT‚ÄÔS THE DECEPTION. NOW MAN IS NOT YET WHAT HE WILL BE. THERE WILL BE A NEW MAN, HAPPY AND PROUD. FOR WHOM IT WILL BE THE SAME TO LIVE OR NOT TO LIVE, HE WILL BE THE NEW MAN. HE WHO WILL CONQUER PAIN AND TERROR WILL HIMSELF BE A GOD. AND THIS GOD WILL NOT BE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEN THIS GOD DOES EXIST ACCORDING TO YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE DOES NOT EXIST, BUT HE IS. IN THE STONE THERE IS NO PAIN, BUT IN THE FEAR OF THE STONE IS THE PAIN. GOD IS THE PAIN OF THE FEAR OF DEATH. HE WHO WILL CONQUER PAIN AND TERROR WILL BECOME HIMSELF A GOD. THEN THERE WILL BE A NEW LIFE, A NEW MAN; EVERYTHING WILL BE NEW ‚Ä¶ THEN THEY WILL DIVIDE HISTORY INTO TWO PARTS: FROM THE GORILLA TO THE ANNIHILATION OF GOD, AND FROM THE ANNIHILATION OF GOD TO ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO THE GORILLA?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚ‚Ä¶ TO THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE EARTH, AND OF MAN PHYSICALLY. MAN WILL BE GOD, AND WILL BE TRANSFORMED PHYSICALLY, AND THE WORLD WILL BE TRANSFORMED AND THINGS WILL BE TRANSFORMED AND THOUGHTS AND ALL FEELINGS. WHAT DO YOU THINK: WILL MAN BE CHANGED PHYSICALLY THEN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF IT WILL BE JUST THE SAME LIVING OR NOT LIVING, ALL WILL KILL THEMSELVES, AND PERHAPS THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT THE CHANGE WILL BE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS NO MATTER. THEY WILL KILL DECEPTION. EVERY ONE WHO WANTS THE SUPREME FREEDOM MUST DARE TO KILL HIMSELF. HE WHO DARES TO KILL HIMSELF HAS FOUND OUT THE SECRET OF THE DECEPTION. THERE IS NO FREEDOM BEYOND; THAT IS ALL, AND THERE IS NOTHING BEYOND. HE WHO DARES KILL HIMSELF IS GOD. NOW EVERY ONE CAN DO SO THAT THERE SHALL BE NO GOD AND SHALL BE NOTHING. BUT NO ONE HAS ONCE DONE IT YET.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHERE HAVE BEEN MILLIONS OF SUICIDES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT ALWAYS NOT FOR THAT; ALWAYS WITH TERROR AND NOT FOR THAT OBJECT. NOT TO KILL FEAR. HE WHO KILLS HIMSELF ONLY TO KILL FEAR WILL BECOME A GOD AT ONCE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE WON‚ÄÔT HAVE TIME, PERHAPS,‚ÄÙ I OBSERVED.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS NO MATTER,‚ÄÙ HE ANSWERED SOFTLY, WITH CALM PRIDE, ALMOST DISDAIN. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM SORRY THAT YOU SEEM TO BE LAUGHING,‚ÄÙ HE ADDED HALF A MINUTE LATER.

‚ÄÚIT SEEMS STRANGE TO ME THAT YOU WERE SO IRRITABLE THIS MORNING AND ARE NOW SO CALM, THOUGH YOU SPEAK WITH WARMTH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHIS MORNING? IT WAS FUNNY THIS MORNING,‚ÄÙ HE ANSWERED WITH A SMILE. ‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT LIKE SCOLDING, AND I NEVER LAUGH,‚ÄÙ HE ADDED MOURNFULLY.

‚ÄÚYES, YOU DON‚ÄÔT SPEND YOUR NIGHTS VERY CHEERFULLY OVER YOUR TEA.‚ÄÙ

I GOT UP AND TOOK MY CAP.

‚ÄÚYOU THINK NOT?‚ÄÙ HE SMILED WITH SOME SURPRISE. ‚ÄÚWHY? NO, I ‚Ä¶ I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW.‚ÄÙ HE WAS SUDDENLY CONFUSED. ‚ÄÚI KNOW NOT HOW IT IS WITH THE OTHERS, AND I FEEL THAT I CANNOT DO AS OTHERS. EVERYBODY THINKS AND THEN AT ONCE THINKS OF SOMETHING ELSE. I CAN‚ÄÔT THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE. I THINK ALL MY LIFE OF ONE THING. GOD HAS TORMENTED ME ALL MY LIFE,‚ÄÙ HE ENDED UP SUDDENLY WITH ASTONISHING EXPANSIVENESS.

‚ÄÚAND TELL ME, IF I MAY ASK, WHY IS IT YOU SPEAK RUSSIAN NOT QUITE CORRECTLY? SURELY YOU HAVEN‚ÄÔT FORGOTTEN IT AFTER FIVE YEARS ABROAD?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT I SPEAK CORRECTLY? I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW. NO, IT‚ÄÔS NOT BECAUSE OF ABROAD. I HAVE TALKED LIKE THAT ALL MY LIFE ‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS NO MATTER TO ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚANOTHER QUESTION, A MORE DELICATE ONE. I QUITE BELIEVE YOU THAT YOU‚ÄÔRE DISINCLINED TO MEET PEOPLE AND TALK VERY LITTLE. WHY HAVE YOU TALKED TO ME NOW?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO YOU? THIS MORNING YOU SAT SO NICELY AND YOU ‚Ä¶ BUT IT‚ÄÔS ALL NO MATTER ‚Ä¶ YOU ARE LIKE MY BROTHER, VERY MUCH, EXTREMELY,‚ÄÙ HE ADDED, FLUSHING. ‚ÄÚHE HAS BEEN DEAD SEVEN YEARS. HE WAS OLDER, VERY, VERY MUCH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SUPPOSE HE HAD A GREAT INFLUENCE ON YOUR WAY OF THINKING?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚN-NO. HE SAID LITTLE; HE SAID NOTHING. I‚ÄÔLL GIVE YOUR NOTE.‚ÄÙ

HE SAW ME TO THE GATE WITH A LANTERN, TO LOCK IT AFTER ME. ‚ÄÚOF COURSE HE‚ÄÔS MAD,‚ÄÙ I DECIDED. IN THE GATEWAY I MET WITH ANOTHER ENCOUNTER.

IX

I HAD ONLY JUST LIFTED MY LEG OVER THE HIGH BARRIER ACROSS THE BOTTOM OF THE GATEWAY, WHEN SUDDENLY A STRONG HAND CLUTCHED AT MY CHEST.

‚ÄÚWHO‚ÄÔS THIS?‚ÄÙ ROARED A VOICE, ‚ÄÚA FRIEND OR AN ENEMY? OWN UP!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS ONE OF US; ONE OF US!‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS VOICE SQUEALED NEAR BY. ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS MR. G‚ÄÎ‚ÄÎV, A YOUNG MAN OF CLASSICAL EDUCATION, IN TOUCH WITH THE HIGHEST SOCIETY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI LOVE HIM IF HE‚ÄÔS IN SOCIETY, CLAS-SI ‚Ä¶ THAT MEANS HE‚ÄÔS HIGH-LY ED-U-CATED. THE RETIRED CAPTAIN IGNAT LEBYADKIN, AT THE SERVICE OF THE WORLD AND HIS FRIENDS ‚Ä¶ IF THEY‚ÄÔRE TRUE ONES, IF THEY‚ÄÔRE TRUE ONES, THE SCOUNDRELS.‚ÄÙ

CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN, A STOUT, FLESHY MAN OVER SIX FEET IN HEIGHT, WITH CURLY HAIR AND A RED FACE, WAS SO EXTREMELY DRUNK THAT HE COULD SCARCELY STAND UP BEFORE ME, AND ARTICULATED WITH DIFFICULTY. I HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE, HOWEVER, IN THE DISTANCE.

‚ÄÚAND THIS ONE!‚ÄÙ HE ROARED AGAIN, NOTICING KIRILLOV, WHO WAS STILL STANDING WITH THE LANTERN; HE RAISED HIS FIST, BUT LET IT FALL AGAIN AT ONCE.

‚ÄÚI FORGIVE YOU FOR YOUR LEARNING! IGNAT LEBYADKIN‚ÄÎHIGH-LY ED-U-CATED.‚Ä¶

     ‚ÄÒA BOMB OF LOVE WITH STINGING SMART
     EXPLODED IN IGNATY‚ÄÔS HEART.
     IN ANGUISH DIRE I WEEP AGAIN
     THE ARM THAT AT SEVASTOPOL
     I LOST IN BITTER PAIN!‚ÄÔ
NOT THAT I EVER WAS AT SEVASTOPOL, OR EVER LOST MY ARM, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT RHYME IS.‚ÄÙ HE PUSHED UP TO ME WITH HIS UGLY, TIPSY FACE.

‚ÄÚHE IS IN A HURRY, HE IS GOING HOME!‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN TRIED TO PERSUADE HIM. ‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔLL TELL LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA TO-MORROW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLIZAVETA!‚ÄÙ HE YELLED AGAIN. ‚ÄÚSTAY, DON‚ÄÔT GO! A VARIATION:

     ‚ÄÒAMONG THE AMAZONS A STAR,
       UPON HER STEED SHE FLASHES BY,
     AND SMILES UPON ME FROM AFAR,
       THE CHILD OF ARIS-TO-CRA-CY!‚ÄÔ
                      TO A STARRY AMAZON.
YOU KNOW THAT‚ÄÔS A HYMN. IT‚ÄÔS A HYMN, IF YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT AN ASS! THE DUFFERS, THEY DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND! STAY!‚ÄÙ

HE CAUGHT HOLD OF MY COAT, THOUGH I PULLED MYSELF AWAY WITH ALL MY MIGHT.

‚ÄÚTELL HER I‚ÄÔM A KNIGHT AND THE SOUL OF HONOUR, AND AS FOR THAT DASHA ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔD PICK HER UP AND CHUCK HER OUT.‚Ä¶ SHE‚ÄÔS ONLY A SERF, SHE DAREN‚ÄÔT ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

AT THIS POINT HE FELL DOWN, FOR I PULLED MYSELF VIOLENTLY OUT OF HIS HANDS AND RAN INTO THE STREET. LIPUTIN CLUNG ON TO ME.

‚ÄÚALEXEY NILITCH WILL PICK HIM UP. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I‚ÄÔVE JUST FOUND OUT FROM HIM?‚ÄÙ HE BABBLED IN DESPERATE HASTE. ‚ÄÚDID YOU HEAR HIS VERSES? HE‚ÄÔS SEALED THOSE VERSES TO THE ‚ÄÒSTARRY AMAZON‚ÄÔ IN AN ENVELOPE AND IS GOING TO SEND THEM TO-MORROW TO LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA, SIGNED WITH HIS NAME IN FULL. WHAT A FELLOW!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI BET YOU SUGGESTED IT TO HIM YOURSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔLL LOSE YOUR BET,‚ÄÙ LAUGHED LIPUTIN. ‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS IN LOVE, IN LOVE LIKE A CAT, AND DO YOU KNOW IT BEGAN WITH HATRED. HE HATED LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA AT FIRST SO MUCH, FOR RIDING ON HORSEBACK THAT HE ALMOST SWORE ALOUD AT HER IN THE STREET. YES, HE DID ABUSE HER! ONLY THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY HE SWORE AT HER WHEN SHE RODE BY‚ÄÎLUCKILY SHE DIDN‚ÄÔT HEAR. AND, SUDDENLY, TO-DAY‚ÄÎPOETRY! DO YOU KNOW HE MEANS TO RISK A PROPOSAL? SERIOUSLY! SERIOUSLY!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WONDER AT YOU, LIPUTIN; WHENEVER THERE‚ÄÔS ANYTHING NASTY GOING ON YOU‚ÄÔRE ALWAYS ON THE SPOT TAKING A LEADING PART IN IT,‚ÄÙ I SAID ANGRILY.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE GOING RATHER FAR, MR. G‚ÄÎ‚ÄÎV. ISN‚ÄÔT YOUR POOR LITTLE HEART QUAKING, PERHAPS, IN TERROR OF A RIVAL?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHA-AT!‚ÄÙ I CRIED, STANDING STILL.

‚ÄÚWELL, NOW TO PUNISH YOU I WON‚ÄÔT SAY ANYTHING MORE, AND WOULDN‚ÄÔT YOU LIKE TO KNOW THOUGH? TAKE THIS ALONE, THAT THAT LOUT IS NOT A SIMPLE CAPTAIN NOW BUT A LANDOWNER OF OUR PROVINCE, AND RATHER AN IMPORTANT ONE, TOO, FOR NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SOLD HIM ALL HIS ESTATE THE OTHER DAY, FORMERLY OF TWO HUNDRED SERFS; AND AS GOD‚ÄÔS ABOVE, I‚ÄÔM NOT LYING. I‚ÄÔVE ONLY JUST HEARD IT, BUT IT WAS FROM A MOST RELIABLE SOURCE. AND NOW YOU CAN FERRET IT OUT FOR YOURSELF; I‚ÄÔLL SAY NOTHING MORE; GOOD-BYE.‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS AWAITING ME WITH HYSTERICAL IMPATIENCE. IT WAS AN HOUR SINCE HE HAD RETURNED. I FOUND HIM IN A STATE RESEMBLING INTOXICATION; FOR THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES AT LEAST I THOUGHT HE WAS DRUNK. ALAS, THE VISIT TO THE DROZDOVS HAD BEEN THE FINISHING-STROKE.

‚ÄÚMON AMI! I HAVE COMPLETELY LOST THE THREAD ‚Ä¶ LISE ‚Ä¶ I LOVE AND RESPECT THAT ANGEL AS BEFORE; JUST AS BEFORE; BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THEY BOTH ASKED ME SIMPLY TO FIND OUT SOMETHING FROM ME, THAT IS MORE SIMPLY TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF ME, AND THEN TO GET RID OF ME.‚Ä¶ THAT‚ÄÔS HOW IT IS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED!‚ÄÙ I COULDN‚ÄÔT HELP EXCLAIMING.

‚ÄÚMY FRIEND, NOW I AM UTTERLY ALONE. ENFIN, C‚ÄÔEST RIDICULE. WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT, THE PLACE IS POSITIVELY PACKED WITH MYSTERIES THERE TOO. THEY SIMPLY FLEW AT ME ABOUT THOSE EARS AND NOSES, AND SOME MYSTERIES IN PETERSBURG TOO. YOU KNOW THEY HADN‚ÄÔT HEARD TILL THEY CAME ABOUT THE TRICKS NICOLAS PLAYED HERE FOUR YEARS AGO. ‚ÄÒYOU WERE HERE, YOU SAW IT, IS IT TRUE THAT HE IS MAD?‚ÄÔ WHERE THEY GOT THE IDEA I CAN‚ÄÔT MAKE OUT. WHY IS IT THAT PRASKOVYA IS SO ANXIOUS NICOLAS SHOULD BE MAD? THE WOMAN WILL HAVE IT SO, SHE WILL. CE MAURICE, OR WHAT‚ÄÔS HIS NAME, MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, BRAVE HOMME TOUT DE M√™ME ‚Ä¶ BUT CAN IT BE FOR HIS SAKE, AND AFTER SHE WROTE HERSELF FROM PARIS TO CETTE PAUVRE AMIE?‚Ä¶ ENFIN, THIS PRASKOVYA, AS CETTE CH√®RE AMIE CALLS HER, IS A TYPE. SHE‚ÄÔS GOGOL‚ÄÔS MADAME BOX, OF IMMORTAL MEMORY, ONLY SHE‚ÄÔS A SPITEFUL MADAME BOX, A MALIGNANT BOX, AND IN AN IMMENSELY EXAGGERATED FORM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS MAKING HER OUT A REGULAR PACKING-CASE IF IT‚ÄÔS AN EXAGGERATED FORM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, PERHAPS IT‚ÄÔS THE OPPOSITE; IT‚ÄÔS ALL THE SAME, ONLY DON‚ÄÔT INTERRUPT ME, FOR I‚ÄÔM ALL IN A WHIRL. THEY ARE ALL AT LOGGERHEADS, EXCEPT LISE, SHE KEEPS ON WITH HER ‚ÄÒAUNTIE, AUNTIE!‚ÄÔ BUT LISE‚ÄÔS SLY, AND THERE‚ÄÔS SOMETHING BEHIND IT TOO. SECRETS. SHE HAS QUARRELLED WITH THE OLD LADY. CETTE PAUVRE AUNTIE TYRANNISES OVER EVERY ONE IT‚ÄÔS TRUE, AND THEN THERE‚ÄÔS THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE, AND THE RUDENESS OF LOCAL SOCIETY, AND KARMAZINOV‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÒRUDENESS‚ÄÔ; AND THEN THIS IDEA OF MADNESS, CE LIPOUTINE, CE QUE JE NE COMPRENDS PAS ‚Ä¶ AND ‚Ä¶ AND THEY SAY SHE‚ÄÔS BEEN PUTTING VINEGAR ON HER HEAD, AND HERE ARE WE WITH OUR COMPLAINTS AND LETTERS.‚Ä¶ OH, HOW I HAVE TORMENTED HER AND AT SUCH A TIME! JE SUIS UN INGRAT! ONLY IMAGINE, I COME BACK AND FIND A LETTER FROM HER; READ IT, READ IT! OH, HOW UNGRATEFUL IT WAS OF ME!‚ÄÙ

HE GAVE ME A LETTER HE HAD JUST RECEIVED FROM VARVARA PETROVNA. SHE SEEMED TO HAVE REPENTED OF HER ‚ÄÚSTAY AT HOME.‚ÄÙ THE LETTER WAS AMIABLE BUT DECIDED IN TONE, AND BRIEF. SHE INVITED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH TO COME TO HER THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW, WHICH WAS SUNDAY, AT TWELVE O‚ÄÔCLOCK, AND ADVISED HIM TO BRING ONE OF HIS FRIENDS WITH HIM. (MY NAME WAS MENTIONED IN PARENTHESIS). SHE PROMISED ON HER SIDE TO INVITE SHATOV, AS THE BROTHER OF DARYA PAVLOVNA. ‚ÄÚYOU CAN OBTAIN A FINAL ANSWER FROM HER: WILL THAT BE ENOUGH FOR YOU? IS THIS THE FORMALITY YOU WERE SO ANXIOUS FOR?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOBSERVE THAT IRRITABLE PHRASE ABOUT FORMALITY. POOR THING, POOR THING, THE FRIEND OF MY WHOLE LIFE! I CONFESS THE SUDDEN DETERMINATION OF MY WHOLE FUTURE ALMOST CRUSHED ME.‚Ä¶ I CONFESS I STILL HAD HOPES, BUT NOW TOUT EST DIT. I KNOW NOW THAT ALL IS OVER. C‚ÄÔEST TERRIBLE! OH, THAT THAT SUNDAY WOULD NEVER COME AND EVERYTHING WOULD GO ON IN THE OLD WAY. YOU WOULD HAVE GONE ON COMING AND I‚ÄÔD HAVE GONE ON HERE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN UPSET BY ALL THOSE NASTY THINGS LIPUTIN SAID, THOSE SLANDERS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMY DEAR, YOU HAVE TOUCHED ON ANOTHER SORE SPOT WITH YOUR FRIENDLY FINGER. SUCH FRIENDLY FINGERS ARE GENERALLY MERCILESS AND SOMETIMES UNREASONABLE; PARDON, YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE IT, BUT I‚ÄÔD ALMOST FORGOTTEN ALL THAT, ALL THAT NASTINESS, NOT THAT I FORGOT IT, INDEED, BUT IN MY FOOLISHNESS I TRIED ALL THE WHILE I WAS WITH LISE TO BE HAPPY AND PERSUADED MYSELF I WAS HAPPY. BUT NOW ‚Ä¶ OH, NOW I‚ÄÔM THINKING OF THAT GENEROUS, HUMANE WOMAN, SO LONG-SUFFERING WITH MY CONTEMPTIBLE FAILINGS‚ÄÎNOT THAT SHE‚ÄÔS BEEN ALTOGETHER LONG-SUFFERING, BUT WHAT HAVE I BEEN WITH MY HORRID, WORTHLESS CHARACTER! I‚ÄÔM A CAPRICIOUS CHILD, WITH ALL THE EGOISM OF A CHILD AND NONE OF THE INNOCENCE. FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS SHE‚ÄÔS BEEN LOOKING AFTER ME LIKE A NURSE, CETTE PAUVRE AUNTIE, AS LISE SO CHARMINGLY CALLS HER.‚Ä¶ AND NOW, AFTER TWENTY YEARS, THE CHILD CLAMOURS TO BE MARRIED, SENDING LETTER AFTER LETTER, WHILE HER HEAD‚ÄÔS IN A VINEGAR-COMPRESS AND ‚Ä¶ NOW HE‚ÄÔS GOT IT‚ÄÎON SUNDAY I SHALL BE A MARRIED MAN, THAT‚ÄÔS NO JOKE.‚Ä¶ AND WHY DID I KEEP INSISTING MYSELF, WHAT DID I WRITE THOSE LETTERS FOR? OH, I FORGOT. LISE IDOLIZES DARYA PAVLOVNA, SHE SAYS SO ANYWAY; SHE SAYS OF HER ‚ÄÒC‚ÄÔEST UN ANGE, ONLY RATHER A RESERVED ONE.‚ÄÔ THEY BOTH ADVISED ME, EVEN PRASKOVYA. ‚Ä¶ PRASKOVYA DIDN‚ÄÔT ADVISE ME THOUGH. OH, WHAT VENOM LIES CONCEALED IN THAT ‚ÄÒBOX‚ÄÔ! AND LISE DIDN‚ÄÔT EXACTLY ADVISE ME: ‚ÄÒWHAT DO YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED FOR,‚ÄÔ SHE SAID, ‚ÄÒYOUR INTELLECTUAL PLEASURES OUGHT TO BE ENOUGH FOR YOU.‚ÄÔ SHE LAUGHED. I FORGIVE HER FOR LAUGHING, FOR THERE‚ÄÔS AN ACHE IN HER OWN HEART. YOU CAN‚ÄÔT GET ON WITHOUT A WOMAN THOUGH, THEY SAID TO ME. THE INFIRMITIES OF AGE ARE COMING UPON YOU, AND SHE WILL TUCK YOU UP, OR WHATEVER IT IS.‚Ä¶ MA FOI, I‚ÄÔVE BEEN THINKING MYSELF ALL THIS TIME I‚ÄÔVE BEEN SITTING WITH YOU THAT PROVIDENCE WAS SENDING HER TO ME IN THE DECLINE OF MY STORMY YEARS AND THAT SHE WOULD TUCK ME UP, OR WHATEVER THEY CALL IT ‚Ä¶ ENFIN, SHE‚ÄÔLL BE HANDY FOR THE HOUSEKEEPING. SEE WHAT A LITTER THERE IS, LOOK HOW EVERYTHING‚ÄÔS LYING ABOUT. I SAID IT MUST BE CLEARED UP THIS MORNING, AND LOOK AT THE BOOK ON THE FLOOR! LA PAUVRE AMIE WAS ALWAYS ANGRY AT THE UNTIDINESS HERE. ‚Ä¶ AH, NOW I SHALL NO LONGER HEAR HER VOICE! VINGT ANS! AND IT SEEMS THEY‚ÄÔVE HAD ANONYMOUS LETTERS. ONLY FANCY, IT‚ÄÔS SAID THAT NICOLAS HAS SOLD LEBYADKIN HIS PROPERTY. C‚ÄÔEST UN MONSTRE; ET ENFIN WHAT IS LEBYADKIN? LISE LISTENS, AND LISTENS, OOH, HOW SHE LISTENS! I FORGAVE HER LAUGHING. I SAW HER FACE AS SHE LISTENED, AND CE MAURICE ‚Ä¶ I SHOULDN‚ÄÔT CARE TO BE IN HIS SHOES NOW, BRAVE HOMME TOUT DE M√™ME, BUT RATHER SHY; BUT NEVER MIND HIM.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

HE PAUSED. HE WAS TIRED AND UPSET, AND SAT WITH DROOPING HEAD, STARING AT THE FLOOR WITH HIS TIRED EYES. I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE INTERVAL TO TELL HIM OF MY VISIT TO FILIPOV‚ÄÔS HOUSE, AND CURTLY AND DRYLY EXPRESSED MY OPINION THAT LEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS SISTER (WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN) REALLY MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMEHOW VICTIMISED BY NICOLAS AT SOME TIME DURING THAT MYSTERIOUS PERIOD OF HIS LIFE, AS LIPUTIN HAD CALLED IT, AND THAT IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE THAT LEBYADKIN RECEIVED SUMS OF MONEY FROM NICOLAS FOR SOME REASON, BUT THAT WAS ALL. AS FOR THE SCANDAL ABOUT DARYA PAVLOVNA, THAT WAS ALL NONSENSE, ALL THAT BRUTE LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS MISREPRESENTATIONS, THAT THIS WAS ANYWAY WHAT ALEXEY NILITCH WARMLY MAINTAINED, AND WE HAD NO GROUNDS FOR DISBELIEVING HIM. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH LISTENED TO MY ASSURANCES WITH AN ABSENT AIR, AS THOUGH THEY DID NOT CONCERN HIM. I MENTIONED BY THE WAY MY CONVERSATION WITH KIRILLOV, AND ADDED THAT HE MIGHT BE MAD.

‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS NOT MAD, BUT ONE OF THOSE SHALLOW-MINDED PEOPLE,‚ÄÙ HE MUMBLED LISTLESSLY. ‚ÄÚCES GENS-L√† SUPPOSENT LA NATURE ET LA SOCIET√© HUMAINE AUTRES QUE DIEU NE LES A FAITES ET QU‚ÄÔELLES NE SONT R√©ELLEMENT. PEOPLE TRY TO MAKE UP TO THEM, BUT STEPAN VERHOVENSKY DOES NOT, ANYWAY. I SAW THEM THAT TIME IN PETERSBURG AVEC CETTE CH√®RE AMIE (OH, HOW I USED TO WOUND HER THEN), AND I WASN‚ÄÔT AFRAID OF THEIR ABUSE OR EVEN OF THEIR PRAISE. I‚ÄÔM NOT AFRAID NOW EITHER. MAIS PARLONS D‚ÄÔAUTRE CHOSE.‚Ä¶ I BELIEVE I HAVE DONE DREADFUL THINGS. ONLY FANCY, I SENT A LETTER YESTERDAY TO DARYA PAVLOVNA AND ‚Ä¶ HOW I CURSE MYSELF FOR IT!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT DID YOU WRITE ABOUT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, MY FRIEND, BELIEVE ME, IT WAS ALL DONE IN A NOBLE SPIRIT. I LET HER KNOW THAT I HAD WRITTEN TO NICOLAS FIVE DAYS BEFORE, ALSO IN A NOBLE SPIRIT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI UNDERSTAND NOW!‚ÄÙ I CRIED WITH HEAT. ‚ÄÚAND WHAT RIGHT HAD YOU TO COUPLE THEIR NAMES LIKE THAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT, MON CHER, DON‚ÄÔT CRUSH ME COMPLETELY, DON‚ÄÔT SHOUT AT ME; AS IT IS I‚ÄÔM UTTERLY SQUASHED LIKE ‚Ä¶ A BLACK-BEETLE. AND, AFTER ALL, I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL SO HONOURABLE. SUPPOSE THAT SOMETHING REALLY HAPPENED ‚Ä¶ EN SUISSE ‚Ä¶ OR WAS BEGINNING. I WAS BOUND TO QUESTION THEIR HEARTS BEFOREHAND THAT I ‚Ä¶ ENFIN, THAT I MIGHT NOT CONSTRAIN THEIR HEARTS, AND BE A STUMBLING-BLOCK IN THEIR PATHS. I ACTED SIMPLY FROM HONOURABLE FEELING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, HEAVENS! WHAT A STUPID THING YOU‚ÄÔVE DONE!‚ÄÙ I CRIED INVOLUNTARILY.

‚ÄÚYES, YES,‚ÄÙ HE ASSENTED WITH POSITIVE EAGERNESS. ‚ÄÚYOU HAVE NEVER SAID ANYTHING MORE JUST, C‚ÄÔ√©TAIT B√™TE, MAIS QUE FAIRE? TOUT EST DIT. I SHALL MARRY HER JUST THE SAME EVEN IF IT BE TO COVER ‚ÄÒANOTHER‚ÄÔS SINS.‚ÄÔ SO THERE WAS NO OBJECT IN WRITING, WAS THERE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE AT THAT IDEA AGAIN!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, YOU WON‚ÄÔT FRIGHTEN ME WITH YOUR SHOUTS NOW. YOU SEE A DIFFERENT STEPAN VERHOVENSKY BEFORE YOU NOW. THE MAN I WAS IS BURIED. ENFIN, TOUT EST DIT. AND WHY DO YOU CRY OUT? SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT GETTING MARRIED, AND YOU WON‚ÄÔT HAVE TO WEAR A CERTAIN DECORATION ON YOUR HEAD. DOES THAT SHOCK YOU AGAIN? MY POOR FRIEND, YOU DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WOMAN, WHILE I HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT STUDY HER. ‚ÄÒIF YOU WANT TO CONQUER THE WORLD, CONQUER YOURSELF‚ÄÔ‚ÄÎTHE ONE GOOD THING THAT ANOTHER ROMANTIC LIKE YOU, MY BRIDE‚ÄÔS BROTHER, SHATOV, HAS SUCCEEDED IN SAYING. I WOULD GLADLY BORROW FROM HIM HIS PHRASE. WELL, HERE I AM READY TO CONQUER MYSELF, AND I‚ÄÔM GETTING MARRIED. AND WHAT AM I CONQUERING BY WAY OF THE WHOLE WORLD? OH, MY FRIEND, MARRIAGE IS THE MORAL DEATH OF EVERY PROUD SOUL, OF ALL INDEPENDENCE. MARRIED LIFE WILL CORRUPT ME, IT WILL SAP MY ENERGY, MY COURAGE IN THE SERVICE OF THE CAUSE. CHILDREN WILL COME, PROBABLY NOT MY OWN EITHER‚ÄÎCERTAINLY NOT MY OWN: A WISE MAN IS NOT AFRAID TO FACE THE TRUTH. LIPUTIN PROPOSED THIS MORNING PUTTING UP BARRICADES TO KEEP OUT NICOLAS; LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS A FOOL. A WOMAN WOULD DECEIVE THE ALL-SEEING EYE ITSELF. LE BON DIEU KNEW WHAT HE WAS IN FOR WHEN HE WAS CREATING WOMAN, BUT I‚ÄÔM SURE THAT SHE MEDDLED IN IT HERSELF AND FORCED HIM TO CREATE HER SUCH AS SHE IS ‚Ä¶ AND WITH SUCH ATTRIBUTES: FOR WHO WOULD HAVE INCURRED SO MUCH TROUBLE FOR NOTHING? I KNOW NASTASYA MAY BE ANGRY WITH ME FOR FREE-THINKING, BUT ‚Ä¶ ENFIN, TOUT EST DIT.‚ÄÙ

HE WOULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE BEEN HIMSELF IF HE COULD HAVE DISPENSED WITH THE CHEAP GIBING FREE-THOUGHT WHICH WAS IN VOGUE IN HIS DAY. NOW, AT ANY RATE, HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH A GIBE, BUT NOT FOR LONG.

‚ÄÚOH, IF THAT DAY AFTER TO-MORROW, THAT SUNDAY, MIGHT NEVER COME!‚ÄÙ HE EXCLAIMED SUDDENLY, THIS TIME IN UTTER DESPAIR. ‚ÄÚWHY COULD NOT THIS ONE WEEK BE WITHOUT A SUNDAY‚ÄÎSI LE MIRACLE EXISTE? WHAT WOULD IT BE TO PROVIDENCE TO BLOT OUT ONE SUNDAY FROM THE CALENDAR? IF ONLY TO PROVE HIS POWER TO THE ATHEISTS ET QUE TOUT SOIT DIT! OH, HOW I LOVED HER! TWENTY YEARS, THESE TWENTY YEARS, AND SHE HAS NEVER UNDERSTOOD ME!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT OF WHOM ARE YOU TALKING? EVEN I DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND YOU!‚ÄÙ I ASKED, WONDERING.

‚ÄÚVINGT ANS! AND SHE HAS NOT ONCE UNDERSTOOD ME; OH, IT‚ÄÔS CRUEL! AND CAN SHE REALLY BELIEVE THAT I AM MARRYING FROM FEAR, FROM POVERTY? OH, THE SHAME OF IT! OH, AUNTIE, AUNTIE, I DO IT FOR YOU!‚Ä¶ OH, LET HER KNOW, THAT AUNTIE, THAT SHE IS THE ONE WOMAN I HAVE ADORED FOR TWENTY YEARS! SHE MUST LEARN THIS, IT MUST BE SO, IF NOT THEY WILL NEED FORCE TO DRAG ME UNDER CE QU‚ÄÔON APPELLE LE WEDDING-CROWN.‚ÄÙ

IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD HEARD THIS CONFESSION, AND SO VIGOROUSLY UTTERED. I WON‚ÄÔT CONCEAL THE FACT THAT I WAS TERRIBLY TEMPTED TO LAUGH. I WAS WRONG.

‚ÄÚHE IS THE ONLY ONE LEFT ME NOW, THE ONLY ONE, MY ONE HOPE!‚ÄÙ HE CRIED SUDDENLY, CLASPING HIS HANDS AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A NEW IDEA. ‚ÄÚONLY HE, MY POOR BOY, CAN SAVE ME NOW, AND, OH, WHY DOESN‚ÄÔT HE COME! OH, MY SON, OH, MY PETRUSHA.‚Ä¶ AND THOUGH I DO NOT DESERVE THE NAME OF FATHER, BUT RATHER THAT OF TIGER, YET ‚Ä¶ LAISSEZ-MOI, MON AMI, I‚ÄÔLL LIE DOWN A LITTLE, TO COLLECT MY IDEAS. I AM SO TIRED, SO TIRED. AND I THINK IT‚ÄÔS TIME YOU WERE IN BED. VOYEZ VOUS, IT‚ÄÔS TWELVE O‚ÄÔCLOCK.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ





CHAPTER IV. THE CRIPPLE

I

SHATOV WAS NOT PERVERSE BUT ACTED ON MY NOTE, AND CALLED AT MIDDAY ON LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA. WE WENT IN ALMOST TOGETHER; I WAS ALSO GOING TO MAKE MY FIRST CALL. THEY WERE ALL, THAT IS LIZA, HER MOTHER, AND MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, SITTING IN THE BIG DRAWING-ROOM, ARGUING. THE MOTHER WAS ASKING LIZA TO PLAY SOME WALTZ ON THE PIANO, AND AS SOON AS LIZA BEGAN TO PLAY THE PIECE ASKED FOR, DECLARED IT WAS NOT THE RIGHT ONE. MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH IN THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS HEART TOOK LIZA‚ÄÔS PART, MAINTAINING THAT IT WAS THE RIGHT WALTZ. THE ELDER LADY WAS SO ANGRY THAT SHE BEGAN TO CRY. SHE WAS ILL AND WALKED WITH DIFFICULTY. HER LEGS WERE SWOLLEN, AND FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS SHE HAD BEEN CONTINUALLY FRACTIOUS, QUARRELLING WITH EVERY ONE, THOUGH SHE ALWAYS STOOD RATHER IN AWE OF LIZA. THEY WERE PLEASED TO SEE US. LIZA FLUSHED WITH PLEASURE, AND SAYING ‚ÄÚMERCI‚ÄÙ TO ME, ON SHATOV‚ÄÔS ACCOUNT OF COURSE, WENT TO MEET HIM, LOOKING AT HIM WITH INTEREST.

SHATOV STOPPED AWKWARDLY IN THE DOORWAY. THANKING HIM FOR COMING SHE LED HIM UP TO HER MOTHER.

‚ÄÚTHIS IS MR. SHATOV, OF WHOM I HAVE TOLD YOU, AND THIS IS MR. G‚ÄÎ‚ÄÎV, A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE AND OF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS. MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH MADE HIS ACQUAINTANCE YESTERDAY, TOO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND WHICH IS THE PROFESSOR?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHERE‚ÄÔS NO PROFESSOR AT ALL, MAMAN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT THERE IS. YOU SAID YOURSELF THAT THERE‚ÄÔD BE A PROFESSOR. IT‚ÄÔS THIS ONE, PROBABLY.‚ÄÙ SHE DISDAINFULLY INDICATED SHATOV.

‚ÄÚI DIDN‚ÄÔT TELL YOU THAT THERE‚ÄÔD BE A PROFESSOR. MR. G‚ÄÎ‚ÄÎV IS IN THE SERVICE, AND MR. SHATOV IS A FORMER STUDENT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚA STUDENT OR PROFESSOR, THEY ALL COME FROM THE UNIVERSITY JUST THE SAME. YOU ONLY WANT TO ARGUE. BUT THE SWISS ONE HAD MOUSTACHES AND A BEARD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS THE SON OF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH THAT MAMAN ALWAYS CALLS THE PROFESSOR,‚ÄÙ SAID LIZA, AND SHE TOOK SHATOV AWAY TO THE SOFA AT THE OTHER END OF THE DRAWING-ROOM.

‚ÄÚWHEN HER LEGS SWELL, SHE‚ÄÔS ALWAYS LIKE THIS, YOU UNDERSTAND SHE‚ÄÔS ILL,‚ÄÙ SHE WHISPERED TO SHATOV, STILL WITH THE SAME MARKED CURIOSITY, SCRUTINISING HIM, ESPECIALLY HIS SHOCK OF HAIR.

‚ÄÚARE YOU AN OFFICER?‚ÄÙ THE OLD LADY INQUIRED OF ME. LIZA HAD MERCILESSLY ABANDONED ME TO HER.

‚ÄÚN-NO.‚ÄÎI‚ÄÔM IN THE SERVICE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMR. G‚ÄÎ‚ÄÎV IS A GREAT FRIEND OF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS,‚ÄÙ LIZA CHIMED IN IMMEDIATELY.

‚ÄÚARE YOU IN STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS SERVICE? YES, AND HE‚ÄÔS A PROFESSOR, TOO, ISN‚ÄÔT HE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAH, MAMAN, YOU MUST DREAM AT NIGHT OF PROFESSORS,‚ÄÙ CRIED LIZA WITH ANNOYANCE.

‚ÄÚI SEE TOO MANY WHEN I‚ÄÔM AWAKE. BUT YOU ALWAYS WILL CONTRADICT YOUR MOTHER. WERE YOU HERE FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD?‚ÄÙ

I ANSWERED THAT I WAS.

‚ÄÚAND THERE WAS SOME ENGLISHMAN WITH YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, THERE WAS NOT.‚ÄÙ

LIZA LAUGHED.

‚ÄÚWELL, YOU SEE THERE WAS NO ENGLISHMAN, SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN IDLE GOSSIP. AND VARVARA PETROVNA AND STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH BOTH TELL LIES. AND THEY ALL TELL LIES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAUNTIE AND STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH YESTERDAY THOUGHT THERE WAS A RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH AND PRINCE HARRY IN SHAKESPEARE‚ÄÔS HENRY IV, AND IN ANSWER TO THAT MAMAN SAYS THAT THERE WAS NO ENGLISHMAN HERE,‚ÄÙ LIZA EXPLAINED TO US.

‚ÄÚIF HARRY WASN‚ÄÔT HERE, THERE WAS NO ENGLISHMAN. IT WAS NO ONE ELSE BUT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH AT HIS TRICKS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI ASSURE YOU THAT MAMAN‚ÄÔS DOING IT ON PURPOSE,‚ÄÙ LIZA THOUGHT NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN TO SHATOV. ‚ÄÚSHE‚ÄÔS REALLY HEARD OF SHAKESPEARE. I READ HER THE FIRST ACT OF OTHELLO MYSELF. BUT SHE‚ÄÔS IN GREAT PAIN NOW. MAMAN, LISTEN, IT‚ÄÔS STRIKING TWELVE, IT‚ÄÔS TIME YOU TOOK YOUR MEDICINE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE DOCTOR‚ÄÔS COME,‚ÄÙ A MAID-SERVANT ANNOUNCED AT THE DOOR.

THE OLD LADY GOT UP AND BEGAN CALLING HER DOG: ‚ÄÚZEMIRKA, ZEMIRKA, YOU COME WITH ME AT LEAST.‚ÄÙ

ZEMIRKA, A HORRID LITTLE OLD DOG, INSTEAD OF OBEYING, CREPT UNDER THE SOFA WHERE LIZA WAS SITTING.

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT YOU WANT TO? THEN I DON‚ÄÔT WANT YOU. GOOD-BYE, MY GOOD SIR, I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW YOUR NAME OR YOUR FATHER‚ÄÔS,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID, ADDRESSING ME.

‚ÄÚANTON LAVRENTYEVITCH ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, IT DOESN‚ÄÔT MATTER, WITH ME IT GOES IN AT ONE EAR AND OUT OF THE OTHER. DON‚ÄÔT YOU COME WITH ME, MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, IT WAS ZEMIRKA I CALLED. THANK GOD I CAN STILL WALK WITHOUT HELP AND TO-MORROW I SHALL GO FOR A DRIVE.‚ÄÙ

SHE WALKED ANGRILY OUT OF THE DRAWING-ROOM.

‚ÄÚANTON LAVRENTYEVITCH, WILL YOU TALK MEANWHILE TO MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH; I ASSURE YOU YOU‚ÄÔLL BOTH BE GAINERS BY GETTING TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER BETTER,‚ÄÙ SAID LIZA, AND SHE GAVE A FRIENDLY SMILE TO MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, WHO BEAMED ALL OVER AS SHE LOOKED AT HIM. THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT, I REMAINED TO TALK TO MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH.

II

LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA‚ÄÔS BUSINESS WITH SHATOV TURNED OUT, TO MY SURPRISE, TO BE REALLY ONLY CONCERNED WITH LITERATURE. I HAD IMAGINED, I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHY, THAT SHE HAD ASKED HIM TO COME WITH SOME OTHER OBJECT. WE, MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH AND I THAT IS, SEEING THAT THEY WERE TALKING ALOUD AND NOT TRYING TO HIDE ANYTHING FROM US, BEGAN TO LISTEN, AND AT LAST THEY ASKED OUR ADVICE. IT TURNED OUT THAT LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA WAS THINKING OF BRINGING OUT A BOOK WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD BE OF USE, BUT BEING QUITE INEXPERIENCED SHE NEEDED SOMEONE TO HELP HER. THE EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH SHE BEGAN TO EXPLAIN HER PLAN TO SHATOV QUITE SURPRISED ME.

‚ÄÚSHE MUST BE ONE OF THE NEW PEOPLE,‚ÄÙ I THOUGHT. ‚ÄÚSHE HAS NOT BEEN TO SWITZERLAND FOR NOTHING.‚ÄÙ

SHATOV LISTENED WITH ATTENTION, HIS EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND, SHOWING NOT THE SLIGHTEST SURPRISE THAT A GIDDY YOUNG LADY IN SOCIETY SHOULD TAKE UP WORK THAT SEEMED SO OUT OF KEEPING WITH HER.

HER LITERARY SCHEME WAS AS FOLLOWS. NUMBERS OF PAPERS AND JOURNALS ARE PUBLISHED IN THE CAPITALS AND THE PROVINCES OF RUSSIA, AND EVERY DAY A NUMBER OF EVENTS ARE REPORTED IN THEM. THE YEAR PASSES, THE NEWSPAPERS ARE EVERYWHERE FOLDED UP AND PUT AWAY IN CUPBOARDS, OR ARE TORN UP AND BECOME LITTER, OR ARE USED FOR MAKING PARCELS OR WRAPPING THINGS. NUMBERS OF THESE FACTS MAKE AN IMPRESSION AND ARE REMEMBERED BY THE PUBLIC, BUT IN THE COURSE OF YEARS THEY ARE FORGOTTEN. MANY PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO LOOK THEM UP, BUT IT IS A LABOUR FOR THEM TO EMBARK UPON THIS SEA OF PAPER, OFTEN KNOWING NOTHING OF THE DAY OR PLACE OR EVEN YEAR IN WHICH THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. YET IF ALL THE FACTS FOR A WHOLE YEAR WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER INTO ONE BOOK, ON A DEFINITE PLAN, AND WITH A DEFINITE OBJECT, UNDER HEADINGS WITH REFERENCES, ARRANGED ACCORDING TO MONTHS AND DAYS, SUCH A COMPILATION MIGHT REFLECT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF RUSSIAN LIFE FOR THE WHOLE YEAR, EVEN THOUGH THE FACTS PUBLISHED ARE ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE EVENTS THAT TAKE PLACE.

‚ÄÚINSTEAD OF A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS THERE WOULD BE A FEW FAT BOOKS, THAT‚ÄÔS ALL,‚ÄÙ OBSERVED SHATOV.

BUT LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA CLUNG TO HER IDEA, IN SPITE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF CARRYING IT OUT AND HER INABILITY TO DESCRIBE IT. ‚ÄÚIT OUGHT TO BE ONE BOOK, AND NOT EVEN A VERY THICK ONE,‚ÄÙ SHE MAINTAINED. BUT EVEN IF IT WERE THICK IT WOULD BE CLEAR, FOR THE GREAT POINT WOULD BE THE PLAN AND THE CHARACTER OF THE PRESENTATION OF FACTS. OF COURSE NOT ALL WOULD BE COLLECTED AND REPRINTED. THE DECREES AND ACTS OF GOVERNMENT, LOCAL REGULATIONS, LAWS‚ÄÎALL SUCH FACTS, HOWEVER IMPORTANT, MIGHT BE ALTOGETHER OMITTED FROM THE PROPOSED PUBLICATION. THEY COULD LEAVE OUT A GREAT DEAL AND CONFINE THEMSELVES TO A SELECTION OF EVENTS MORE OR LESS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MORAL LIFE OF THE PEOPLE, OF THE PERSONAL CHARACTER OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. OF COURSE EVERYTHING MIGHT BE PUT IN: STRANGE INCIDENTS, FIRES, PUBLIC SUBSCRIPTIONS, ANYTHING GOOD OR BAD, EVERY SPEECH OR WORD, PERHAPS EVEN FLOODINGS OF THE RIVERS, PERHAPS EVEN SOME GOVERNMENT DECREES, BUT ONLY SUCH THINGS TO BE SELECTED AS ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PERIOD; EVERYTHING WOULD BE PUT IN WITH A CERTAIN VIEW, A SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE AND INTENTION, WITH AN IDEA WHICH WOULD ILLUMINATE THE FACTS LOOKED AT IN THE AGGREGATE, AS A WHOLE. AND FINALLY THE BOOK OUGHT TO BE INTERESTING EVEN FOR LIGHT READING, APART FROM ITS VALUE AS A WORK OF REFERENCE. IT WOULD BE, SO TO SAY, A PRESENTATION OF THE SPIRITUAL, MORAL, INNER LIFE OF RUSSIA FOR A WHOLE YEAR.

‚ÄÚWE WANT EVERY ONE TO BUY IT, WE WANT IT TO BE A BOOK THAT WILL BE FOUND ON EVERY TABLE,‚ÄÙ LIZA DECLARED. ‚ÄÚI UNDERSTAND THAT ALL LIES IN THE PLAN, AND THAT‚ÄÔS WHY I APPLY TO YOU,‚ÄÙ SHE CONCLUDED. SHE GREW VERY WARM OVER IT, AND ALTHOUGH HER EXPLANATION WAS OBSCURE AND INCOMPLETE, SHATOV BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND.

‚ÄÚSO IT WOULD AMOUNT TO SOMETHING WITH A POLITICAL TENDENCY, A SELECTION OF FACTS WITH A SPECIAL TENDENCY,‚ÄÙ HE MUTTERED, STILL NOT RAISING HIS HEAD.

‚ÄÚNOT AT ALL, WE MUST NOT SELECT WITH A PARTICULAR BIAS, AND WE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ANY POLITICAL TENDENCY IN IT. NOTHING BUT IMPARTIALITY‚ÄÎTHAT WILL BE THE ONLY TENDENCY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT A TENDENCY WOULD BE NO HARM,‚ÄÙ SAID SHATOV, WITH A SLIGHT MOVEMENT, ‚ÄÚAND ONE CAN HARDLY AVOID IT IF THERE IS ANY SELECTION AT ALL. THE VERY SELECTION OF FACTS WILL SUGGEST HOW THEY ARE TO BE UNDERSTOOD. YOUR IDEA IS NOT A BAD ONE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEN SUCH A BOOK IS POSSIBLE?‚ÄÙ CRIED LIZA DELIGHTEDLY.

‚ÄÚWE MUST LOOK INTO IT AND CONSIDER. IT‚ÄÔS AN IMMENSE UNDERTAKING. ONE CAN‚ÄÔT WORK IT OUT ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT. WE NEED EXPERIENCE. AND WHEN WE DO PUBLISH THE BOOK I DOUBT WHETHER WE SHALL FIND OUT HOW TO DO IT. POSSIBLY AFTER MANY TRIALS; BUT THE THOUGHT IS ALLURING. IT‚ÄÔS A USEFUL IDEA.‚ÄÙ

HE RAISED HIS EYES AT LAST, AND THEY WERE POSITIVELY SPARKLING WITH PLEASURE, HE WAS SO INTERESTED.

‚ÄÚWAS IT YOUR OWN IDEA?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED LIZA, IN A FRIENDLY AND, AS IT WERE, BASHFUL WAY.

‚ÄÚTHE IDEA‚ÄÔS NO TROUBLE, YOU KNOW, IT‚ÄÔS THE PLAN IS THE TROUBLE,‚ÄÙ LIZA SMILED. ‚ÄÚI UNDERSTAND VERY LITTLE. I AM NOT VERY CLEVER, AND I ONLY PURSUE WHAT IS CLEAR TO ME, MYSELF.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPURSUE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPERHAPS THAT‚ÄÔS NOT THE RIGHT WORD?‚ÄÙ LIZA INQUIRED QUICKLY.

‚ÄÚTHE WORD IS ALL RIGHT; I MEANT NOTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI THOUGHT WHILE I WAS ABROAD THAT EVEN I MIGHT BE OF SOME USE. I HAVE MONEY OF MY OWN LYING IDLE. WHY SHOULDN‚ÄÔT I‚ÄÎEVEN I‚ÄÎWORK FOR THE COMMON CAUSE? BESIDES, THE IDEA SOMEHOW OCCURRED TO ME ALL AT ONCE OF ITSELF. I DIDN‚ÄÔT INVENT IT AT ALL, AND WAS DELIGHTED WITH IT. BUT I SAW AT ONCE THAT I COULDN‚ÄÔT GET ON WITHOUT SOMEONE TO HELP, BECAUSE I AM NOT COMPETENT TO DO ANYTHING OF MYSELF. MY HELPER, OF COURSE, WOULD BE THE CO-EDITOR OF THE BOOK. WE WOULD GO HALVES. YOU WOULD GIVE THE PLAN AND THE WORK. MINE WOULD BE THE ORIGINAL IDEA AND THE MEANS FOR PUBLISHING IT. WOULD THE BOOK PAY ITS EXPENSES, DO YOU THINK?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF WE HIT ON A GOOD PLAN THE BOOK WILL GO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WARN YOU THAT I AM NOT DOING IT FOR PROFIT; BUT I AM VERY ANXIOUS THAT THE BOOK SHOULD CIRCULATE AND SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF MAKING A PROFIT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, BUT HOW DO I COME IN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, I INVITE YOU TO BE MY FELLOW-WORKER, TO GO HALVES. YOU WILL THINK OUT THE PLAN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW DO YOU KNOW THAT I AM CAPABLE OF THINKING OUT THE PLAN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT YOU TO ME, AND HERE I‚ÄÔVE HEARD ‚Ä¶ I KNOW THAT YOU ARE VERY CLEVER AND ‚Ä¶ ARE WORKING FOR THE CAUSE ‚Ä¶ AND THINK A GREAT DEAL. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH VERHOVENSKY SPOKE ABOUT YOU IN SWITZERLAND,‚ÄÙ SHE ADDED HURRIEDLY. ‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS A VERY CLEVER MAN, ISN‚ÄÔT HE?‚ÄÙ

SHATOV STOLE A FLEETING, MOMENTARY GLANCE AT HER, BUT DROPPED HIS EYES AGAIN.

‚ÄÚNIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH TOLD ME A GREAT DEAL ABOUT YOU, TOO.‚ÄÙ

SHATOV SUDDENLY TURNED RED.

‚ÄÚBUT HERE ARE THE NEWSPAPERS.‚ÄÙ LIZA HURRIEDLY PICKED UP FROM A CHAIR A BUNDLE OF NEWSPAPERS THAT LAY TIED UP READY. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE TRIED TO MARK THE FACTS HERE FOR SELECTION, TO SORT THEM, AND I HAVE PUT THE PAPERS TOGETHER ‚Ä¶ YOU WILL SEE.‚ÄÙ

SHATOV TOOK THE BUNDLE.

‚ÄÚTAKE THEM HOME AND LOOK AT THEM. WHERE DO YOU LIVE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIN BOGOYAVLENSKY STREET, FILIPOV‚ÄÔS HOUSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNOW. I THINK IT‚ÄÔS THERE, TOO, I‚ÄÔVE BEEN TOLD, A CAPTAIN LIVES, BESIDE YOU, MR. LEBYADKIN,‚ÄÙ SAID LIZA IN THE SAME HURRIED MANNER.

SHATOV SAT FOR A FULL MINUTE WITH THE BUNDLE IN HIS OUTSTRETCHED HAND, MAKING NO ANSWER AND STARING AT THE FLOOR.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔD BETTER FIND SOMEONE ELSE FOR THESE JOBS. I SHOULDN‚ÄÔT SUIT YOU AT ALL,‚ÄÙ HE BROUGHT OUT AT LAST, DROPPING HIS VOICE IN AN AWFULLY STRANGE WAY, ALMOST TO A WHISPER.

LIZA FLUSHED CRIMSON.

‚ÄÚWHAT JOBS ARE YOU SPEAKING OF? MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH,‚ÄÙ SHE CRIED, ‚ÄÚPLEASE BRING THAT LETTER HERE.‚ÄÙ

I TOO FOLLOWED MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH TO THE TABLE.

‚ÄÚLOOK AT THIS,‚ÄÙ SHE TURNED SUDDENLY TO ME, UNFOLDING THE LETTER IN GREAT EXCITEMENT. ‚ÄÚHAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. PLEASE READ IT ALOUD. I WANT MR. SHATOV TO HEAR IT TOO.‚ÄÙ

WITH NO LITTLE ASTONISHMENT I READ ALOUD THE FOLLOWING MISSIVE:

    ‚ÄÚTO THE PERFECTION, MISS TUSHIN.
‚ÄÚGRACIOUS LADY
    ‚ÄÚLIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA!

    ‚ÄÚOH, SHE‚ÄÔS A SWEET QUEEN,
     LIZAVETA TUSHIN!
     WHEN ON SIDE-SADDLE SHE GALLOPS BY,
     AND IN THE BREEZE HER FAIR TRESSES FLY!
     OR WHEN WITH HER MOTHER IN CHURCH SHE BOWS LOW
     AND ON DEVOUT FACES A RED FLUSH DOTH FLOW!
     THEN FOR THE JOYS OF LAWFUL WEDLOCK I ASPIRE,
     AND FOLLOW HER AND HER MOTHER WITH TEARS OF DESIRE.

‚ÄÚCOMPOSED BY AN UNLEARNED MAN IN THE MIDST OF A DISCUSSION.

‚ÄÚGRACIOUS LADY!

    ‚ÄÚI PITY MYSELF ABOVE ALL MEN THAT I DID NOT LOSE MY ARM AT SEVASTOPOL,
NOT HAVING BEEN THERE AT ALL, BUT SERVED ALL THE CAMPAIGN DELIVERING
PALTRY PROVISIONS, WHICH I LOOK ON AS A DEGRADATION. YOU ARE A GODDESS
OF ANTIQUITY, AND I AM NOTHING, BUT HAVE HAD A GLIMPSE OF INFINITY.
LOOK ON IT AS A POEM AND NO MORE, FOR, AFTER ALL, POETRY IS NONSENSE AND
JUSTIFIES WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED IMPUDENCE IN PROSE. CAN THE SUN BE
ANGRY WITH THE INFUSORIA IF THE LATTER COMPOSES VERSES TO HER FROM THE
DROP OF WATER, WHERE THERE IS A MULTITUDE OF THEM IF YOU LOOK THROUGH
THE MICROSCOPE? EVEN THE CLUB FOR PROMOTING HUMANITY TO THE LARGER
ANIMALS IN TIP-TOP SOCIETY IN PETERSBURG, WHICH RIGHTLY FEELS COMPASSION
FOR DOGS AND HORSES, DESPISES THE BRIEF INFUSORIA MAKING NO REFERENCE
TO IT WHATEVER, BECAUSE IT IS NOT BIG ENOUGH. I‚ÄÔM NOT BIG ENOUGH EITHER.
THE IDEA OF MARRIAGE MIGHT SEEM DROLL, BUT SOON I SHALL HAVE PROPERTY
WORTH TWO HUNDRED SOULS THROUGH A MISANTHROPIST WHOM YOU OUGHT TO
DESPISE. I CAN TELL A LOT AND I CAN UNDERTAKE TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS
THAT WOULD MEAN SIBERIA. DON‚ÄÔT DESPISE MY PROPOSAL. A LETTER FROM AN
INFUSORIA IS OF COURSE IN VERSE.

    ‚ÄÚCAPTAIN LEBYADKIN YOUR MOST HUMBLE FRIEND.
    AND HE HAS TIME NO END.‚ÄÙ
‚ÄÚTHAT WAS WRITTEN BY A MAN IN A DRUNKEN CONDITION, A WORTHLESS FELLOW,‚ÄÙ I CRIED INDIGNANTLY. ‚ÄÚI KNOW HIM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT LETTER I RECEIVED YESTERDAY,‚ÄÙ LIZA BEGAN TO EXPLAIN, FLUSHING AND SPEAKING HURRIEDLY. ‚ÄÚI SAW MYSELF, AT ONCE, THAT IT CAME FROM SOME FOOLISH CREATURE, AND I HAVEN‚ÄÔT YET SHOWN IT TO MAMAN, FOR FEAR OF UPSETTING HER MORE. BUT IF HE IS GOING TO KEEP ON LIKE THAT, I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HOW TO ACT. MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH WANTS TO GO OUT AND FORBID HIM TO DO IT. AS I HAVE LOOKED UPON YOU AS A COLLEAGUE,‚ÄÙ SHE TURNED TO SHATOV, ‚ÄÚAND AS YOU LIVE THERE, I WANTED TO QUESTION YOU SO AS TO JUDGE WHAT MORE IS TO BE EXPECTED OF HIM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS A DRUNKARD AND A WORTHLESS FELLOW,‚ÄÙ SHATOV MUTTERED WITH APPARENT RELUCTANCE.

‚ÄÚIS HE ALWAYS SO STUPID?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, HE‚ÄÔS NOT STUPID AT ALL WHEN HE‚ÄÔS NOT DRUNK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI USED TO KNOW A GENERAL WHO WROTE VERSES EXACTLY LIKE THAT,‚ÄÙ I OBSERVED, LAUGHING.

‚ÄÚONE CAN SEE FROM THE LETTER THAT HE IS CLEVER ENOUGH FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES,‚ÄÙ MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, WHO HAD TILL THEN BEEN SILENT, PUT IN UNEXPECTEDLY.

‚ÄÚHE LIVES WITH SOME SISTER?‚ÄÙ LIZA QUERIED.

‚ÄÚYES, WITH HIS SISTER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEY SAY HE TYRANNISES OVER HER, IS THAT TRUE?‚ÄÙ

SHATOV LOOKED AT LIZA AGAIN, SCOWLED, AND MUTTERING, ‚ÄÚWHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF MINE?‚ÄÙ MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR.

‚ÄÚAH, STAY!‚ÄÙ CRIED LIZA, IN A FLUTTER. ‚ÄÚWHERE ARE YOU GOING? WE HAVE SO MUCH STILL TO TALK OVER.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT IS THERE TO TALK OVER? I‚ÄÔLL LET YOU KNOW TO-MORROW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OF ALL‚ÄÎTHE PRINTING-PRESS! DO BELIEVE ME THAT I AM NOT IN JEST, THAT I REALLY WANT TO WORK IN GOOD EARNEST!‚ÄÙ LIZA ASSURED HIM IN GROWING AGITATION. ‚ÄÚIF WE DECIDE TO PUBLISH IT, WHERE IS IT TO BE PRINTED? YOU KNOW IT‚ÄÔS A MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION, FOR WE SHAN‚ÄÔT GO TO MOSCOW FOR IT, AND THE PRINTING-PRESS HERE IS OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR SUCH A PUBLICATION. I MADE UP MY MIND LONG AGO TO SET UP A PRINTING-PRESS OF MY OWN, IN YOUR NAME PERHAPS‚ÄÎAND I KNOW MAMAN WILL ALLOW IT SO LONG AS IT IS IN YOUR NAME.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW DO YOU KNOW THAT I COULD BE A PRINTER?‚ÄÙ SHATOV ASKED SULLENLY.

‚ÄÚWHY, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH TOLD ME OF YOU IN SWITZERLAND, AND REFERRED ME TO YOU AS ONE WHO KNOWS THE BUSINESS AND ABLE TO SET UP A PRINTING-PRESS. HE EVEN MEANT TO GIVE ME A NOTE TO YOU FROM HIMSELF, BUT I FORGOT IT.‚ÄÙ

SHATOV‚ÄÔS FACE CHANGED, AS I RECOLLECT NOW. HE STOOD FOR A FEW SECONDS LONGER, THEN WENT OUT OF THE ROOM.

LIZA WAS ANGRY.

‚ÄÚDOES HE ALWAYS GO OUT LIKE THAT?‚ÄÙ SHE ASKED, TURNING TO ME.

I WAS JUST SHRUGGING MY SHOULDERS WHEN SHATOV SUDDENLY CAME BACK, WENT STRAIGHT UP TO THE TABLE AND PUT DOWN THE ROLL OF PAPERS HE HAD TAKEN.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM NOT GOING TO BE YOUR HELPER, I HAVEN‚ÄÔT THE TIME.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY? WHY? I THINK YOU ARE ANGRY!‚ÄÙ LIZA ASKED HIM IN A GRIEVED AND IMPLORING VOICE.

THE SOUND OF HER VOICE SEEMED TO STRIKE HIM; FOR SOME MOMENTS HE LOOKED AT HER INTENTLY, AS THOUGH TRYING TO PENETRATE TO HER VERY SOUL.

‚ÄÚNO MATTER,‚ÄÙ HE MUTTERED, SOFTLY, ‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

AND HE WENT AWAY ALTOGETHER.

LIZA WAS COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED, QUITE DISPROPORTIONATELY IN FACT, SO IT SEEMED TO ME.

‚ÄÚWONDERFULLY QUEER MAN,‚ÄÙ MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH OBSERVED ALOUD.

III

HE CERTAINLY WAS QUEER, BUT IN ALL THIS THERE WAS A VERY GREAT DEAL NOT CLEAR TO ME. THERE WAS SOMETHING UNDERLYING IT ALL. I SIMPLY DID NOT BELIEVE IN THIS PUBLICATION; THEN THAT STUPID LETTER, IN WHICH THERE WAS AN OFFER, ONLY TOO BAREFACED, TO GIVE INFORMATION AND PRODUCE ‚ÄÚDOCUMENTS,‚ÄÙ THOUGH THEY WERE ALL SILENT ABOUT THAT, AND TALKED OF SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT; FINALLY THAT PRINTING-PRESS AND SHATOV‚ÄÔS SUDDEN EXIT, JUST BECAUSE THEY SPOKE OF A PRINTING-PRESS. ALL THIS LED ME TO IMAGINE THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED BEFORE I CAME IN OF WHICH I KNEW NOTHING; AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THAT IT WAS NO BUSINESS OF MINE AND THAT I WAS IN THE WAY. AND, INDEED, IT WAS TIME TO TAKE LEAVE, I HAD STAYED LONG ENOUGH FOR THE FIRST CALL. I WENT UP TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA.

SHE SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT I WAS IN THE ROOM, AND WAS STILL STANDING IN THE SAME PLACE BY THE TABLE WITH HER HEAD BOWED, PLUNGED IN THOUGHT, GAZING FIXEDLY AT ONE SPOT ON THE CARPET.

‚ÄÚAH, YOU, TOO, ARE GOING, GOOD-BYE,‚ÄÙ SHE MURMURED IN AN ORDINARY FRIENDLY TONE. ‚ÄÚGIVE MY GREETINGS TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, AND PERSUADE HIM TO COME AND SEE ME AS SOON AS HE CAN. MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, ANTON LAVRENTYEVITCH IS GOING. EXCUSE MAMAN‚ÄÔS NOT BEING ABLE TO COME OUT AND SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOU.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

I WENT OUT AND HAD REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS WHEN A FOOTMAN SUDDENLY OVERTOOK ME AT THE STREET DOOR.

‚ÄÚMY LADY BEGS YOU TO COME BACK.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE MISTRESS, OR LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE YOUNG LADY.‚ÄÙ

I FOUND LIZA NOT IN THE BIG ROOM WHERE WE HAD BEEN SITTING, BUT IN THE RECEPTION-ROOM NEXT TO IT. THE DOOR BETWEEN IT AND THE DRAWING-ROOM, WHERE MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH WAS LEFT ALONE, WAS CLOSED.

LIZA SMILED TO ME BUT WAS PALE. SHE WAS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM IN EVIDENT INDECISION, VISIBLY STRUGGLING WITH HERSELF; BUT SHE SUDDENLY TOOK ME BY THE HAND, AND LED ME QUICKLY TO THE WINDOW.

‚ÄÚI WANT TO SEE HER AT ONCE,‚ÄÙ SHE WHISPERED, BENDING UPON ME A BURNING, PASSIONATE, IMPATIENT GLANCE, WHICH WOULD NOT ADMIT A HINT OF OPPOSITION. ‚ÄÚI MUST SEE HER WITH MY OWN EYES, AND I BEG YOU TO HELP ME.‚ÄÙ

SHE WAS IN A PERFECT FRENZY, AND‚ÄÎIN DESPAIR.

‚ÄÚWHO IS IT YOU WANT TO SEE, LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA?‚ÄÙ I INQUIRED IN DISMAY.

‚ÄÚTHAT LEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS SISTER, THAT LAME GIRL.‚Ä¶ IS IT TRUE THAT SHE‚ÄÔS LAME?‚ÄÙ

I WAS ASTOUNDED.

‚ÄÚI HAVE NEVER SEEN HER, BUT I‚ÄÔVE HEARD THAT SHE‚ÄÔS LAME. I HEARD IT YESTERDAY,‚ÄÙ I SAID WITH HURRIED READINESS, AND ALSO IN A WHISPER.

‚ÄÚI MUST SEE HER, ABSOLUTELY. COULD YOU ARRANGE IT TO-DAY?‚ÄÙ

I FELT DREADFULLY SORRY FOR HER.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE, AND, BESIDES, I SHOULD NOT KNOW AT ALL HOW TO SET ABOUT IT,‚ÄÙ I BEGAN PERSUADING HER. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL GO TO SHATOV.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF YOU DON‚ÄÔT ARRANGE IT BY TO-MORROW I‚ÄÔLL GO TO HER BY MYSELF, ALONE, FOR MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH HAS REFUSED. I REST ALL MY HOPES ON YOU AND I‚ÄÔVE NO ONE ELSE; I SPOKE STUPIDLY TO SHATOV.‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔM SURE THAT YOU ARE PERFECTLY HONEST AND PERHAPS READY TO DO ANYTHING FOR ME, ONLY ARRANGE IT.‚ÄÙ

I FELT A PASSIONATE DESIRE TO HELP HER IN EVERY WAY.

‚ÄÚTHIS IS WHAT I‚ÄÔLL DO,‚ÄÙ I SAID, AFTER A MOMENT‚ÄÔS THOUGHT. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL GO MYSELF TO-DAY AND WILL SEE HER FOR SURE, FOR SURE. I WILL MANAGE SO AS TO SEE HER. I GIVE YOU MY WORD OF HONOUR. ONLY LET ME CONFIDE IN SHATOV.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTELL HIM THAT I DO DESIRE IT, AND THAT I CAN‚ÄÔT WAIT ANY LONGER, BUT THAT I WASN‚ÄÔT DECEIVING HIM JUST NOW. HE WENT AWAY PERHAPS BECAUSE HE‚ÄÔS VERY HONEST AND HE DIDN‚ÄÔT LIKE MY SEEMING TO DECEIVE HIM. I WASN‚ÄÔT DECEIVING HIM, I REALLY DO WANT TO EDIT BOOKS AND FOUND A PRINTING-PRESS.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE IS HONEST, VERY HONEST,‚ÄÙ I ASSENTED WARMLY.

‚ÄÚIF IT‚ÄÔS NOT ARRANGED BY TO-MORROW, THOUGH, I SHALL GO MYSELF WHATEVER HAPPENS, AND EVEN IF EVERY ONE WERE TO KNOW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI CAN‚ÄÔT BE WITH YOU BEFORE THREE O‚ÄÔCLOCK TO-MORROW,‚ÄÙ I OBSERVED, AFTER A MOMENT‚ÄÔS DELIBERATION.

‚ÄÚAT THREE O‚ÄÔCLOCK THEN. THEN IT WAS TRUE WHAT I IMAGINED YESTERDAY AT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS, THAT YOU‚ÄÎARE RATHER DEVOTED TO ME?‚ÄÙ SHE SAID WITH A SMILE, HURRIEDLY PRESSING MY HAND TO SAY GOOD-BYE, AND HURRYING BACK TO THE FORSAKEN MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH.

I WENT OUT WEIGHED DOWN BY MY PROMISE, AND UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD HAPPENED. I HAD SEEN A WOMAN IN REAL DESPAIR, NOT HESITATING TO COMPROMISE HERSELF BY CONFIDING IN A MAN SHE HARDLY KNEW. HER WOMANLY SMILE AT A MOMENT SO TERRIBLE FOR HER AND HER HINT THAT SHE HAD NOTICED MY FEELINGS THE DAY BEFORE SENT A PANG TO MY HEART; BUT I FELT SORRY FOR HER, VERY SORRY‚ÄÎTHAT WAS ALL! HER SECRETS BECAME AT ONCE SOMETHING SACRED FOR ME, AND IF ANYONE HAD BEGUN TO REVEAL THEM TO ME NOW, I THINK I SHOULD HAVE COVERED MY EARS, AND SHOULD HAVE REFUSED TO HEAR ANYTHING MORE. I ONLY HAD A PRESENTIMENT OF SOMETHING ‚Ä¶ YET I WAS UTTERLY AT A LOSS TO SEE HOW I COULD DO ANYTHING. WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE I DID NOT EVEN YET UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT I HAD TO ARRANGE; AN INTERVIEW, BUT WHAT SORT OF AN INTERVIEW? AND HOW COULD I BRING THEM TOGETHER? MY ONLY HOPE WAS SHATOV, THOUGH I COULD BE SURE THAT HE WOULDN‚ÄÔT HELP ME IN ANY WAY. BUT ALL THE SAME, I HURRIED TO HIM.

IV

I DID NOT FIND HIM AT HOME TILL PAST SEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK THAT EVENING. TO MY SURPRISE HE HAD VISITORS WITH HIM‚ÄÎALEXEY NILITCH, AND ANOTHER GENTLEMAN I HARDLY KNEW, ONE SHIGALOV, THE BROTHER OF VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS WIFE.

THIS GENTLEMAN MUST, I THINK, HAVE BEEN STAYING ABOUT TWO MONTHS IN THE TOWN; I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHERE HE CAME FROM. I HAD ONLY HEARD THAT HE HAD WRITTEN SOME SORT OF ARTICLE IN A PROGRESSIVE PETERSBURG MAGAZINE. VIRGINSKY HAD INTRODUCED ME CASUALLY TO HIM IN THE STREET. I HAD NEVER IN MY LIFE SEEN IN A MAN‚ÄÔS FACE SO MUCH DESPONDENCY, GLOOM, AND MOROSENESS. HE LOOKED AS THOUGH HE WERE EXPECTING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WORLD, AND NOT AT SOME INDEFINITE TIME IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROPHECIES, WHICH MIGHT NEVER BE FULFILLED, BUT QUITE DEFINITELY, AS THOUGH IT WERE TO BE THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW AT TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES PAST TEN. WE HARDLY SAID A WORD TO ONE ANOTHER ON THAT OCCASION, BUT HAD SIMPLY SHAKEN HANDS LIKE TWO CONSPIRATORS. I WAS MOST STRUCK BY HIS EARS, WHICH WERE OF UNNATURAL SIZE, LONG, BROAD, AND THICK, STICKING OUT IN A PECULIAR WAY. HIS GESTURES WERE SLOW AND AWKWARD.

IF LIPUTIN HAD IMAGINED THAT A PHALANSTERY MIGHT BE ESTABLISHED IN OUR PROVINCE, THIS GENTLEMAN CERTAINLY KNEW THE DAY AND THE HOUR WHEN IT WOULD BE FOUNDED. HE MADE A SINISTER IMPRESSION ON ME. I WAS THE MORE SURPRISED AT FINDING HIM HERE, AS SHATOV WAS NOT FOND OF VISITORS.

I COULD HEAR FROM THE STAIRS THAT THEY WERE TALKING VERY LOUD, ALL THREE AT ONCE, AND I FANCY THEY WERE DISPUTING; BUT AS SOON AS I WENT IN, THEY ALL CEASED SPEAKING. THEY WERE ARGUING, STANDING UP, BUT NOW THEY ALL SUDDENLY SAT DOWN, SO THAT I HAD TO SIT DOWN TOO. THERE WAS A STUPID SILENCE THAT WAS NOT BROKEN FOR FULLY THREE MINUTES. THOUGH SHIGALOV KNEW ME, HE AFFECTED NOT TO KNOW ME, PROBABLY NOT FROM HOSTILE FEELINGS, BUT FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON. ALEXEY NILITCH AND I BOWED TO ONE ANOTHER IN SILENCE, AND FOR SOME REASON DID NOT SHAKE HANDS. SHIGALOV BEGAN AT LAST LOOKING AT ME STERNLY AND FROWNINGLY, WITH THE MOST NA√ØVE ASSURANCE THAT I SHOULD IMMEDIATELY GET UP AND GO AWAY. AT LAST SHATOV GOT UP FROM HIS CHAIR AND THE OTHERS JUMPED UP AT ONCE. THEY WENT OUT WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE. SHIGALOV ONLY SAID IN THE DOORWAY TO SHATOV, WHO WAS SEEING HIM OUT:

‚ÄÚREMEMBER THAT YOU ARE BOUND TO GIVE AN EXPLANATION.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHANG YOUR EXPLANATION, AND WHO THE DEVIL AM I BOUND TO?‚ÄÙ SAID SHATOV. HE SHOWED THEM OUT AND FASTENED THE DOOR WITH THE LATCH.

‚ÄÚSNIPES!‚ÄÙ HE SAID, LOOKING AT ME, WITH A SORT OF WRY SMILE.

HIS FACE LOOKED ANGRY, AND IT SEEMED STRANGE TO ME THAT HE SPOKE FIRST. WHEN I HAD BEEN TO SEE HIM BEFORE (WHICH WAS NOT OFTEN) IT HAD USUALLY HAPPENED THAT HE SAT SCOWLING IN A CORNER, ANSWERED ILL-HUMOUREDLY AND ONLY COMPLETELY THAWED AND BEGAN TO TALK WITH PLEASURE AFTER A CONSIDERABLE TIME. EVEN SO, WHEN HE WAS SAYING GOOD-BYE HE ALWAYS SCOWLED, AND LET ONE OUT AS THOUGH HE WERE GETTING RID OF A PERSONAL ENEMY.

‚ÄÚI HAD TEA YESTERDAY WITH THAT ALEXEY NILITCH,‚ÄÙ I OBSERVED. ‚ÄÚI THINK HE‚ÄÔS MAD ON ATHEISM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚRUSSIAN ATHEISM HAS NEVER GONE FURTHER THAN MAKING A JOKE,‚ÄÙ GROWLED SHATOV, PUTTING UP A NEW CANDLE IN PLACE OF AN END THAT HAD BURNT OUT.

‚ÄÚNO, THIS ONE DOESN‚ÄÔT SEEM TO ME A JOKER, I THINK HE DOESN‚ÄÔT KNOW HOW TO TALK, LET ALONE TRYING TO MAKE JOKES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMEN MADE OF PAPER! IT ALL COMES FROM FLUNKEYISM OF THOUGHT,‚ÄÙ SHATOV OBSERVED CALMLY, SITTING DOWN ON A CHAIR IN THE CORNER, AND PRESSING THE PALMS OF BOTH HANDS ON HIS KNEES.

‚ÄÚTHERE‚ÄÔS HATRED IN IT, TOO,‚ÄÙ HE WENT ON, AFTER A MINUTE‚ÄÔS PAUSE. ‚ÄÚTHEY‚ÄÔD BE THE FIRST TO BE TERRIBLY UNHAPPY IF RUSSIA COULD BE SUDDENLY REFORMED, EVEN TO SUIT THEIR OWN IDEAS, AND BECAME EXTRAORDINARILY PROSPEROUS AND HAPPY. THEY‚ÄÔD HAVE NO ONE TO HATE THEN, NO ONE TO CURSE, NOTHING TO FIND FAULT WITH. THERE IS NOTHING IN IT BUT AN IMMENSE ANIMAL HATRED FOR RUSSIA WHICH HAS EATEN INTO THEIR ORGANISM.‚Ä¶ AND IT ISN‚ÄÔT A CASE OF TEARS UNSEEN BY THE WORLD UNDER COVER OF A SMILE! THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A FALSER WORD SAID IN RUSSIA THAN ABOUT THOSE UNSEEN TEARS,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, ALMOST WITH FURY.

‚ÄÚGOODNESS ONLY KNOWS WHAT YOU‚ÄÔRE SAYING,‚ÄÙ I LAUGHED.

‚ÄÚOH, YOU‚ÄÔRE A ‚ÄÒMODERATE LIBERAL,‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ SAID SHATOV, SMILING TOO. ‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW,‚ÄÙ HE WENT ON SUDDENLY, ‚ÄÚI MAY HAVE BEEN TALKING NONSENSE ABOUT THE ‚ÄÒFLUNKEYISM OF THOUGHT.‚ÄÔ YOU WILL SAY TO ME NO DOUBT DIRECTLY, ‚ÄÒIT‚ÄÔS YOU WHO ARE THE SON OF A FLUNKEY, BUT I‚ÄÔM NOT A FLUNKEY.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WASN‚ÄÔT DREAMING OF SUCH A THING.‚Ä¶ WHAT ARE YOU SAYING!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU NEED NOT APOLOGISE. I‚ÄÔM NOT AFRAID OF YOU. ONCE I WAS ONLY THE SON OF A FLUNKEY, BUT NOW I‚ÄÔVE BECOME A FLUNKEY MYSELF, LIKE YOU. OUR RUSSIAN LIBERAL IS A FLUNKEY BEFORE EVERYTHING, AND IS ONLY LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHOSE BOOTS HE CAN CLEAN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT BOOTS? WHAT ALLEGORY IS THIS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚALLEGORY, INDEED! YOU ARE LAUGHING, I SEE.‚Ä¶ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SAID TRULY THAT I LIE UNDER A STONE, CRUSHED BUT NOT KILLED, AND DO NOTHING BUT WRIGGLE. IT WAS A GOOD COMPARISON OF HIS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSTEPAN TROFIMOVITCH DECLARES THAT YOU ARE MAD OVER THE GERMANS,‚ÄÙ I LAUGHED. ‚ÄÚWE‚ÄÔVE BORROWED SOMETHING FROM THEM ANYWAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWE TOOK TWENTY KOPECKS, BUT WE GAVE UP A HUNDRED ROUBLES OF OUR OWN.‚ÄÙ

WE WERE SILENT A MINUTE.

‚ÄÚHE GOT THAT SORE LYING IN AMERICA.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHO? WHAT SORE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI MEAN KIRILLOV. I SPENT FOUR MONTHS WITH HIM LYING ON THE FLOOR OF A HUT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, HAVE YOU BEEN IN AMERICA?‚ÄÙ I ASKED, SURPRISED. ‚ÄÚYOU NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT IS THERE TO TELL? THE YEAR BEFORE LAST WE SPENT OUR LAST FARTHING, THREE OF US, GOING TO AMERICA IN AN EMIGRANT STEAMER, TO TEST THE LIFE OF THE AMERICAN WORKMAN ON OURSELVES, AND TO VERIFY BY PERSONAL EXPERIMENT THE STATE OF A MAN IN THE HARDEST SOCIAL CONDITIONS. THAT WAS OUR OBJECT IN GOING THERE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGOOD LORD!‚ÄÙ I LAUGHED. ‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔD MUCH BETTER HAVE GONE SOMEWHERE IN OUR PROVINCE AT HARVEST-TIME IF YOU WANTED TO ‚ÄÒMAKE A PERSONAL EXPERIMENT‚ÄÔ INSTEAD OF BOLTING TO AMERICA.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWE HIRED OURSELVES OUT AS WORKMEN TO AN EXPLOITER; THERE WERE SIX OF US RUSSIANS WORKING FOR HIM‚ÄÎSTUDENTS, EVEN LANDOWNERS COMING FROM THEIR ESTATES, SOME OFFICERS, TOO, AND ALL WITH THE SAME GRAND OBJECT. WELL, SO WE WORKED, SWEATED, WORE OURSELVES OUT; KIRILLOV AND I WERE EXHAUSTED AT LAST; FELL ILL‚ÄÎWENT AWAY‚ÄÎWE COULDN‚ÄÔT STAND IT. OUR EMPLOYER CHEATED US WHEN HE PAID US OFF; INSTEAD OF THIRTY DOLLARS, AS HE HAD AGREED, HE PAID ME EIGHT AND KIRILLOV FIFTEEN; HE BEAT US, TOO, MORE THAN ONCE. SO THEN WE WERE LEFT WITHOUT WORK, KIRILLOV AND I, AND WE SPENT FOUR MONTHS LYING ON THE FLOOR IN THAT LITTLE TOWN. HE THOUGHT OF ONE THING AND I THOUGHT OF ANOTHER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU DON‚ÄÔT MEAN TO SAY YOUR EMPLOYER BEAT YOU? IN AMERICA? HOW YOU MUST HAVE SWORN AT HIM!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOT A BIT OF IT. ON THE CONTRARY, KIRILLOV AND I MADE UP OUR MINDS FROM THE FIRST THAT WE RUSSIANS WERE LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN BESIDE THE AMERICANS, AND THAT ONE MUST BE BORN IN AMERICA, OR AT LEAST LIVE FOR MANY YEARS WITH AMERICANS TO BE ON A LEVEL WITH THEM. AND DO YOU KNOW, IF WE WERE ASKED A DOLLAR FOR A THING WORTH A FARTHING, WE USED TO PAY IT WITH PLEASURE, IN FACT WITH ENTHUSIASM. WE APPROVED OF EVERYTHING: SPIRITUALISM, LYNCH-LAW, REVOLVERS, TRAMPS. ONCE WHEN WE WERE TRAVELLING A FELLOW SLIPPED HIS HAND INTO MY POCKET, TOOK MY BRUSH, AND BEGAN BRUSHING HIS HAIR WITH IT. KIRILLOV AND I ONLY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER, AND MADE UP OUR MINDS THAT THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING AND THAT WE LIKED IT VERY MUCH.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE STRANGE THING IS THAT WITH US ALL THIS IS NOT ONLY IN THE BRAIN BUT IS CARRIED OUT IN PRACTICE,‚ÄÙ I OBSERVED.

‚ÄÚMEN MADE OF PAPER,‚ÄÙ SHATOV REPEATED.

‚ÄÚBUT TO CROSS THE OCEAN IN AN EMIGRANT STEAMER, THOUGH, TO GO TO AN UNKNOWN COUNTRY, EVEN TO MAKE A PERSONAL EXPERIMENT AND ALL THAT‚ÄÎBY JOVE ‚Ä¶ THERE REALLY IS A LARGE-HEARTED STAUNCHNESS ABOUT IT.‚Ä¶ BUT HOW DID YOU GET OUT OF IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WROTE TO A MAN IN EUROPE AND HE SENT ME A HUNDRED ROUBLES.‚ÄÙ

AS SHATOV TALKED HE LOOKED DOGGEDLY AT THE GROUND AS HE ALWAYS DID, EVEN WHEN HE WAS EXCITED. AT THIS POINT HE SUDDENLY RAISED HIS HEAD.

‚ÄÚDO YOU WANT TO KNOW THE MAN‚ÄÔS NAME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHO WAS IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNIKOLAY STAVROGIN.‚ÄÙ

HE GOT UP SUDDENLY, TURNED TO HIS LIMEWOOD WRITING-TABLE AND BEGAN SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING ON IT. THERE WAS A VAGUE, THOUGH WELL-AUTHENTICATED RUMOUR AMONG US THAT SHATOV‚ÄÔS WIFE HAD AT ONE TIME HAD A LIAISON WITH NIKOLAY STAVROGIN, IN PARIS, AND JUST ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO, THAT IS WHEN SHATOV WAS IN AMERICA. IT IS TRUE THAT THIS WAS LONG AFTER HIS WIFE HAD LEFT HIM IN GENEVA.

‚ÄÚIF SO, WHAT POSSESSES HIM NOW TO BRING HIS NAME FORWARD AND TO LAY STRESS ON IT?‚ÄÙ I THOUGHT.

‚ÄÚI HAVEN‚ÄÔT PAID HIM BACK YET,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, TURNING SUDDENLY TO ME AGAIN, AND LOOKING AT ME INTENTLY HE SAT DOWN IN THE SAME PLACE AS BEFORE IN THE CORNER, AND ASKED ABRUPTLY, IN QUITE A DIFFERENT VOICE:

‚ÄÚYOU HAVE COME NO DOUBT WITH SOME OBJECT. WHAT DO YOU WANT?‚ÄÙ

I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING IMMEDIATELY, IN ITS EXACT HISTORICAL ORDER, AND ADDED THAT THOUGH I HAD TIME TO THINK IT OVER COOLLY AFTER THE FIRST EXCITEMENT WAS OVER, I WAS MORE PUZZLED THAN EVER. I SAW THAT IT MEANT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA. I WAS EXTREMELY ANXIOUS TO HELP HER, BUT THE TROUBLE WAS THAT I DIDN‚ÄÔT KNOW HOW TO KEEP THE PROMISE I HAD MADE HER, AND DIDN‚ÄÔT EVEN QUITE UNDERSTAND NOW WHAT I HAD PROMISED HER. THEN I ASSURED HIM IMPRESSIVELY ONCE MORE THAT SHE HAD NOT MEANT TO DECEIVE HIM, AND HAD HAD NO THOUGHT OF DOING SO; THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME MISUNDERSTANDING, AND THAT SHE HAD BEEN VERY MUCH HURT BY THE EXTRAORDINARY WAY IN WHICH HE HAD GONE OFF THAT MORNING.

HE LISTENED VERY ATTENTIVELY.

‚ÄÚPERHAPS I WAS STUPID THIS MORNING, AS I USUALLY AM.‚Ä¶ WELL, IF SHE DIDN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND WHY I WENT AWAY LIKE THAT ‚Ä¶ SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR HER.‚ÄÙ

HE GOT UP, WENT TO THE DOOR, OPENED IT, AND BEGAN LISTENING ON THE STAIRS.

‚ÄÚDO YOU WANT TO SEE THAT PERSON YOURSELF?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS JUST WHAT I WANTED, BUT HOW IS IT TO BE DONE?‚ÄÙ I CRIED, DELIGHTED.

‚ÄÚLET‚ÄÔS SIMPLY GO DOWN WHILE SHE‚ÄÔS ALONE. WHEN HE COMES IN HE‚ÄÔLL BEAT HER HORRIBLY IF HE FINDS OUT WE‚ÄÔVE BEEN THERE. I OFTEN GO IN ON THE SLY. I WENT FOR HIM THIS MORNING WHEN HE BEGAN BEATING HER AGAIN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU MEAN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DRAGGED HIM OFF HER BY THE HAIR. HE TRIED TO BEAT ME, BUT I FRIGHTENED HIM, AND SO IT ENDED. I‚ÄÔM AFRAID HE‚ÄÔLL COME BACK DRUNK, AND WON‚ÄÔT FORGET IT‚ÄÎHE‚ÄÔLL GIVE HER A BAD BEATING BECAUSE OF IT.‚ÄÙ

WE WENT DOWNSTAIRS AT ONCE.

THE LEBYADKINS‚ÄÔ DOOR WAS SHUT BUT NOT LOCKED, AND WE WERE ABLE TO GO IN. THEIR LODGING CONSISTED OF TWO NASTY LITTLE ROOMS, WITH SMOKE-BEGRIMED WALLS ON WHICH THE FILTHY WALL-PAPER LITERALLY HUNG IN TATTERS. IT HAD BEEN USED FOR SOME YEARS AS AN EATING-HOUSE, UNTIL FILIPOV, THE TAVERN-KEEPER, MOVED TO ANOTHER HOUSE. THE OTHER ROOMS BELOW WHAT HAD BEEN THE EATING-HOUSE WERE NOW SHUT UP, AND THESE TWO WERE ALL THE LEBYADKINS HAD. THE FURNITURE CONSISTED OF PLAIN BENCHES AND DEAL TABLES, EXCEPT FOR AN OLD ARM-CHAIR THAT HAD LOST ITS ARMS. IN THE SECOND ROOM THERE WAS THE BEDSTEAD THAT BELONGED TO MLLE. LEBYADKIN STANDING IN THE CORNER, COVERED WITH A CHINTZ QUILT; THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF WENT TO BED ANYWHERE ON THE FLOOR, OFTEN WITHOUT UNDRESSING. EVERYTHING WAS IN DISORDER, WET AND FILTHY; A HUGE SOAKING RAG LAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR IN THE FIRST ROOM, AND A BATTERED OLD SHOE LAY BESIDE IT IN THE WET. IT WAS EVIDENT THAT NO ONE LOOKED AFTER ANYTHING HERE. THE STOVE WAS NOT HEATED, FOOD WAS NOT COOKED; THEY HAD NOT EVEN A SAMOVAR AS SHATOV TOLD ME. THE CAPTAIN HAD COME TO THE TOWN WITH HIS SISTER UTTERLY DESTITUTE, AND HAD, AS LIPUTIN SAID, AT FIRST ACTUALLY GONE FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE BEGGING. BUT HAVING UNEXPECTEDLY RECEIVED SOME MONEY, HE HAD TAKEN TO DRINKING AT ONCE, AND HAD BECOME SO BESOTTED THAT HE WAS INCAPABLE OF LOOKING AFTER THINGS.

MLLE. LEBYADKIN, WHOM I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO SEE, WAS SITTING QUIETLY AT A DEAL KITCHEN TABLE ON A BENCH IN THE CORNER OF THE INNER ROOM, NOT MAKING A SOUND. WHEN WE OPENED THE DOOR SHE DID NOT CALL OUT TO US OR EVEN MOVE FROM HER PLACE. SHATOV SAID THAT THE DOOR INTO THE PASSAGE WOULD NOT LOCK AND IT HAD ONCE STOOD WIDE OPEN ALL NIGHT. BY THE DIM LIGHT OF A THIN CANDLE IN AN IRON CANDLESTICK, I MADE OUT A WOMAN OF ABOUT THIRTY, PERHAPS, SICKLY AND EMACIATED, WEARING AN OLD DRESS OF DARK COTTON MATERIAL, WITH HER LONG NECK UNCOVERED, HER SCANTY DARK HAIR TWISTED INTO A KNOT ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK, NO LARGER THAN THE FIST OF A TWO-YEAR-OLD CHILD. SHE LOOKED AT US RATHER CHEERFULLY. BESIDES THE CANDLESTICK, SHE HAD ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF HER A LITTLE PEASANT LOOKING-GLASS, AN OLD PACK OF CARDS, A TATTERED BOOK OF SONGS, AND A WHITE ROLL OF GERMAN BREAD FROM WHICH ONE OR TWO BITES HAD BEEN TAKEN. IT WAS NOTICEABLE THAT MLLE. LEBYADKIN USED POWDER AND ROUGE, AND PAINTED HER LIPS. SHE ALSO BLACKENED HER EYEBROWS, WHICH WERE FINE, LONG, AND BLACK ENOUGH WITHOUT THAT. THREE LONG WRINKLES STOOD SHARPLY CONSPICUOUS ACROSS HER HIGH, NARROW FOREHEAD IN SPITE OF THE POWDER ON IT. I ALREADY KNEW THAT SHE WAS LAME, BUT ON THIS OCCASION SHE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO GET UP OR WALK. AT SOME TIME, PERHAPS IN EARLY YOUTH, THAT WASTED FACE MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY; BUT HER SOFT, GENTLE GREY EYES WERE REMARKABLE EVEN NOW. THERE WAS SOMETHING DREAMY AND SINCERE IN HER GENTLE, ALMOST JOYFUL, EXPRESSION. THIS GENTLE SERENE JOY, WHICH WAS REFLECTED ALSO IN HER SMILE, ASTONISHED ME AFTER ALL I HAD HEARD OF THE COSSACK WHIP AND HER BROTHER‚ÄÔS VIOLENCE. STRANGE TO SAY, INSTEAD OF THE OPPRESSIVE REPULSION AND ALMOST DREAD ONE USUALLY FEELS IN THE PRESENCE OF THESE CREATURES AFFLICTED BY GOD, I FELT IT ALMOST PLEASANT TO LOOK AT HER FROM THE FIRST MOMENT, AND MY HEART WAS FILLED AFTERWARDS WITH PITY IN WHICH THERE WAS NO TRACE OF AVERSION.

‚ÄÚTHIS IS HOW SHE SITS LITERALLY FOR DAYS TOGETHER, UTTERLY ALONE, WITHOUT MOVING; SHE TRIES HER FORTUNE WITH THE CARDS, OR LOOKS IN THE LOOKING-GLASS,‚ÄÙ SAID SHATOV, POINTING HER OUT TO ME FROM THE DOORWAY. ‚ÄÚHE DOESN‚ÄÔT FEED HER, YOU KNOW. THE OLD WOMAN IN THE LODGE BRINGS HER SOMETHING SOMETIMES OUT OF CHARITY; HOW CAN THEY LEAVE HER ALL ALONE LIKE THIS WITH A CANDLE!‚ÄÙ

TO MY SURPRISE SHATOV SPOKE ALOUD, JUST AS THOUGH SHE WERE NOT IN THE ROOM.

‚ÄÚGOOD DAY, SHATUSHKA!‚ÄÙ MLLE. LEBYADKIN SAID GENIALLY.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE BROUGHT YOU A VISITOR, MARYA TIMOFYEVNA,‚ÄÙ SAID SHATOV.

‚ÄÚTHE VISITOR IS VERY WELCOME. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHO IT IS YOU‚ÄÔVE BROUGHT, I DON‚ÄÔT SEEM TO REMEMBER HIM.‚ÄÙ SHE SCRUTINISED ME INTENTLY FROM BEHIND THE CANDLE, AND TURNED AGAIN AT ONCE TO SHATOV (AND SHE TOOK NO MORE NOTICE OF ME FOR THE REST OF THE CONVERSATION, AS THOUGH I HAD NOT BEEN NEAR HER).

‚ÄÚARE YOU TIRED OF WALKING UP AND DOWN ALONE IN YOUR GARRET?‚ÄÙ SHE LAUGHED, DISPLAYING TWO ROWS OF MAGNIFICENT TEETH.

‚ÄÚI WAS TIRED OF IT, AND I WANTED TO COME AND SEE YOU.‚ÄÙ

SHATOV MOVED A BENCH UP TO THE TABLE, SAT DOWN ON IT AND MADE ME SIT BESIDE HIM.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM ALWAYS GLAD TO HAVE A TALK, THOUGH YOU‚ÄÔRE A FUNNY PERSON, SHATUSHKA, JUST LIKE A MONK. WHEN DID YOU COMB YOUR HAIR LAST? LET ME DO IT FOR YOU.‚ÄÙ AND SHE PULLED A LITTLE COMB OUT OF HER POCKET. ‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE YOU‚ÄÔVE TOUCHED IT SINCE I COMBED IT LAST.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, I HAVEN‚ÄÔT GOT A COMB,‚ÄÙ SAID SHATOV, LAUGHING TOO.

‚ÄÚREALLY? THEN I‚ÄÔLL GIVE YOU MINE; ONLY REMIND ME, NOT THIS ONE BUT ANOTHER.‚ÄÙ

WITH A MOST SERIOUS EXPRESSION SHE SET TO WORK TO COMB HIS HAIR. SHE EVEN PARTED IT ON ONE SIDE; DREW BACK A LITTLE, LOOKED TO SEE WHETHER IT WAS RIGHT AND PUT THE COMB BACK IN HER POCKET.

‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW WHAT, SHATUSHKA?‚ÄÙ SHE SHOOK HER HEAD. ‚ÄÚYOU MAY BE A VERY SENSIBLE MAN BUT YOU‚ÄÔRE DULL. IT‚ÄÔS STRANGE FOR ME TO LOOK AT ALL OF YOU. I DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS PEOPLE ARE DULL. SADNESS IS NOT DULLNESS. I‚ÄÔM HAPPY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND ARE YOU HAPPY WHEN YOUR BROTHER‚ÄÔS HERE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU MEAN LEBYADKIN? HE‚ÄÔS MY FOOTMAN. AND I DON‚ÄÔT CARE WHETHER HE‚ÄÔS HERE OR NOT. I CALL TO HIM: ‚ÄÒLEBYADKIN, BRING THE WATER!‚ÄÔ OR ‚ÄÒLEBYADKIN, BRING MY SHOES!‚ÄÔ AND HE RUNS. SOMETIMES ONE DOES WRONG AND CAN‚ÄÔT HELP LAUGHING AT HIM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS JUST HOW IT IS,‚ÄÙ SAID SHATOV, ADDRESSING ME ALOUD WITHOUT CEREMONY. ‚ÄÚSHE TREATS HIM JUST LIKE A FOOTMAN. I‚ÄÔVE HEARD HER MYSELF CALLING TO HIM, ‚ÄÒLEBYADKIN, GIVE ME SOME WATER!‚ÄÔ AND SHE LAUGHED AS SHE SAID IT. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT HE DOESN‚ÄÔT FETCH THE WATER BUT BEATS HER FOR IT; BUT SHE ISN‚ÄÔT A BIT AFRAID OF HIM. SHE HAS SOME SORT OF NERVOUS FITS, ALMOST EVERY DAY, AND THEY ARE DESTROYING HER MEMORY SO THAT AFTERWARDS SHE FORGETS EVERYTHING THAT‚ÄÔS JUST HAPPENED, AND IS ALWAYS IN A MUDDLE OVER TIME. YOU IMAGINE SHE REMEMBERS HOW YOU CAME IN; PERHAPS SHE DOES REMEMBER, BUT NO DOUBT SHE HAS CHANGED EVERYTHING TO PLEASE HERSELF, AND SHE TAKES US NOW FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE FROM WHAT WE ARE, THOUGH SHE KNOWS I‚ÄÔM ‚ÄÒSHATUSHKA.‚ÄÔ IT DOESN‚ÄÔT MATTER MY SPEAKING ALOUD, SHE SOON LEAVES OFF LISTENING TO PEOPLE WHO TALK TO HER, AND PLUNGES INTO DREAMS. YES, PLUNGES. SHE‚ÄÔS AN EXTRAORDINARY PERSON FOR DREAMING; SHE‚ÄÔLL SIT FOR EIGHT HOURS, FOR WHOLE DAYS TOGETHER IN THE SAME PLACE. YOU SEE THERE‚ÄÔS A ROLL LYING THERE, PERHAPS SHE‚ÄÔS ONLY TAKEN ONE BITE AT IT SINCE THE MORNING, AND SHE‚ÄÔLL FINISH IT TO-MORROW. NOW SHE‚ÄÔS BEGUN TRYING HER FORTUNE ON CARDS.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KEEP TRYING MY FORTUNE, SHATUSHKA, BUT IT DOESN‚ÄÔT COME OUT RIGHT,‚ÄÙ MARYA TIMOFYEVNA PUT IN SUDDENLY, CATCHING THE LAST WORD, AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT SHE PUT OUT HER LEFT HAND FOR THE ROLL (SHE HAD HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT THE ROLL TOO VERY LIKELY). SHE GOT HOLD OF THE ROLL AT LAST AND AFTER KEEPING IT FOR SOME TIME IN HER LEFT HAND, WHILE HER ATTENTION WAS DISTRACTED BY THE CONVERSATION WHICH SPRANG UP AGAIN, SHE PUT IT BACK AGAIN ON THE TABLE UNCONSCIOUSLY WITHOUT HAVING TAKEN A BITE OF IT.

‚ÄÚIT ALWAYS COMES OUT THE SAME, A JOURNEY, A WICKED MAN, SOMEBODY‚ÄÔS TREACHERY, A DEATH-BED, A LETTER, UNEXPECTED NEWS. I THINK IT‚ÄÔS ALL NONSENSE. SHATUSHKA, WHAT DO YOU THINK? IF PEOPLE CAN TELL LIES WHY SHOULDN‚ÄÔT A CARD?‚ÄÙ SHE SUDDENLY THREW THE CARDS TOGETHER AGAIN. ‚ÄÚI SAID THE SAME THING TO MOTHER PRASKOVYA, SHE‚ÄÔS A VERY VENERABLE WOMAN, SHE USED TO RUN TO MY CELL TO TELL HER FORTUNE ON THE CARDS, WITHOUT LETTING THE MOTHER SUPERIOR KNOW. YES, AND SHE WASN‚ÄÔT THE ONLY ONE WHO CAME TO ME. THEY SIGH, AND SHAKE THEIR HEADS AT ME, THEY TALK IT OVER WHILE I LAUGH. ‚ÄÒWHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET A LETTER FROM, MOTHER PRASKOVYA,‚ÄÔ I SAY, ‚ÄÒWHEN YOU HAVEN‚ÄÔT HAD ONE FOR TWELVE YEARS?‚ÄÔ HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY TO TURKEY BY HER HUSBAND, AND FOR TWELVE YEARS THERE HAD BEEN NO SIGHT NOR SOUND OF HER. ONLY I WAS SITTING THE NEXT EVENING AT TEA WITH THE MOTHER SUPERIOR (SHE WAS A PRINCESS BY BIRTH), THERE WAS SOME LADY THERE TOO, A VISITOR, A GREAT DREAMER, AND A LITTLE MONK FROM ATHOS WAS SITTING THERE TOO, A RATHER ABSURD MAN TO MY THINKING. WHAT DO YOU THINK, SHATUSHKA, THAT MONK FROM ATHOS HAD BROUGHT MOTHER PRASKOVYA A LETTER FROM HER DAUGHTER IN TURKEY, THAT MORNING‚ÄÎSO MUCH FOR THE KNAVE OF DIAMONDS‚ÄÎUNEXPECTED NEWS! WE WERE DRINKING OUR TEA, AND THE MONK FROM ATHOS SAID TO THE MOTHER SUPERIOR, ‚ÄÒBLESSED MOTHER SUPERIOR, GOD HAS BLESSED YOUR CONVENT ABOVE ALL THINGS IN THAT YOU PRESERVE SO GREAT A TREASURE IN ITS PRECINCTS,‚ÄÔ SAID HE. ‚ÄÒWHAT TREASURE IS THAT?‚ÄÔ ASKED THE MOTHER SUPERIOR. ‚ÄÒTHE MOTHER LIZAVETA, THE BLESSED.‚ÄÔ THIS LIZAVETA THE BLESSED WAS ENSHRINED IN THE NUNNERY WALL, IN A CAGE SEVEN FEET LONG AND FIVE FEET HIGH, AND SHE HAD BEEN SITTING THERE FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS IN NOTHING BUT A HEMPEN SHIFT, SUMMER AND WINTER, AND SHE ALWAYS KEPT PECKING AT THE HEMPEN CLOTH WITH A STRAW OR A TWIG OF SOME SORT, AND SHE NEVER SAID A WORD, AND NEVER COMBED HER HAIR, OR WASHED, FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS. IN THE WINTER THEY USED TO PUT A SHEEPSKIN IN FOR HER, AND EVERY DAY A PIECE OF BREAD AND A JUG OF WATER. THE PILGRIMS GAZE AT HER, SIGH AND EXCLAIM, AND MAKE OFFERINGS OF MONEY. ‚ÄÒA TREASURE YOU‚ÄÔVE PITCHED ON,‚ÄÔ ANSWERED THE MOTHER SUPERIOR‚ÄÎ(SHE WAS ANGRY, SHE DISLIKED LIZAVETA DREADFULLY)‚ÄÎ‚ÄÒLIZAVETA ONLY SITS THERE OUT OF SPITE, OUT OF PURE OBSTINACY, IT IS NOTHING BUT HYPOCRISY.‚ÄÔ I DIDN‚ÄÔT LIKE THIS; I WAS THINKING AT THE TIME OF SHUTTING MYSELF UP TOO. ‚ÄÒI THINK,‚ÄÔ SAID I, ‚ÄÒTHAT GOD AND NATURE ARE JUST THE SAME THING.‚ÄÔ THEY ALL CRIED OUT WITH ONE VOICE AT ME, ‚ÄÒWELL, NOW!‚ÄÔ THE MOTHER SUPERIOR LAUGHED, WHISPERED SOMETHING TO THE LADY AND CALLED ME UP, PETTED ME, AND THE LADY GAVE ME A PINK RIBBON. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SHOW IT TO YOU? AND THE MONK BEGAN TO ADMONISH ME. BUT HE TALKED SO KINDLY, SO HUMBLY, AND SO WISELY, I SUPPOSE. I SAT AND LISTENED. ‚ÄÒDO YOU UNDERSTAND?‚ÄÔ HE ASKED. ‚ÄÒNO,‚ÄÔ I SAID, ‚ÄÒI DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND A WORD, BUT LEAVE ME QUITE ALONE.‚ÄÔ EVER SINCE THEN THEY‚ÄÔVE LEFT ME IN PEACE, SHATUSHKA. AND AT THAT TIME AN OLD WOMAN WHO WAS LIVING IN THE CONVENT DOING PENANCE FOR PROPHESYING THE FUTURE, WHISPERED TO ME AS SHE WAS COMING OUT OF CHURCH, ‚ÄÒWHAT IS THE MOTHER OF GOD? WHAT DO YOU THINK?‚ÄÔ ‚ÄÒTHE GREAT MOTHER,‚ÄÔ I ANSWER, ‚ÄÒTHE HOPE OF THE HUMAN RACE.‚ÄÔ ‚ÄÒYES,‚ÄÔ SHE ANSWERED, ‚ÄÒTHE MOTHER OF GOD IS THE GREAT MOTHER‚ÄÎTHE DAMP EARTH, AND THEREIN LIES GREAT JOY FOR MEN. AND EVERY EARTHLY WOE AND EVERY EARTHLY TEAR IS A JOY FOR US; AND WHEN YOU WATER THE EARTH WITH YOUR TEARS A FOOT DEEP, YOU WILL REJOICE AT EVERYTHING AT ONCE, AND YOUR SORROW WILL BE NO MORE, SUCH IS THE PROPHECY.‚ÄÔ THAT WORD SANK INTO MY HEART AT THE TIME. SINCE THEN WHEN I BOW DOWN TO THE GROUND AT MY PRAYERS, I‚ÄÔVE TAKEN TO KISSING THE EARTH. I KISS IT AND WEEP. AND LET ME TELL YOU, SHATUSHKA, THERE‚ÄÔS NO HARM IN THOSE TEARS; AND EVEN IF ONE HAS NO GRIEF, ONE‚ÄÔS TEARS FLOW FROM JOY. THE TEARS FLOW OF THEMSELVES, THAT‚ÄÔS THE TRUTH. I USED TO GO OUT TO THE SHORES OF THE LAKE; ON ONE SIDE WAS OUR CONVENT AND ON THE OTHER THE POINTED MOUNTAIN, THEY CALLED IT THE PEAK. I USED TO GO UP THAT MOUNTAIN, FACING THE EAST, FALL DOWN TO THE GROUND, AND WEEP AND WEEP, AND I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HOW LONG I WEPT, AND I DON‚ÄÔT REMEMBER OR KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I WOULD GET UP, AND TURN BACK WHEN THE SUN WAS SETTING, IT WAS SO BIG, AND SPLENDID AND GLORIOUS‚ÄÎDO YOU LIKE LOOKING AT THE SUN, SHATUSHKA? IT‚ÄÔS BEAUTIFUL BUT SAD. I WOULD TURN TO THE EAST AGAIN, AND THE SHADOW, THE SHADOW OF OUR MOUNTAIN WAS FLYING LIKE AN ARROW OVER OUR LAKE, LONG, LONG AND NARROW, STRETCHING A MILE BEYOND, RIGHT UP TO THE ISLAND ON THE LAKE AND CUTTING THAT ROCKY ISLAND RIGHT IN TWO, AND AS IT CUT IT IN TWO, THE SUN WOULD SET ALTOGETHER AND SUDDENLY ALL WOULD BE DARKNESS. AND THEN I USED TO BE QUITE MISERABLE, SUDDENLY I USED TO REMEMBER, I‚ÄÔM AFRAID OF THE DARK, SHATUSHKA. AND WHAT I WEPT FOR MOST WAS MY BABY.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, HAD YOU ONE?‚ÄÙ AND SHATOV, WHO HAD BEEN LISTENING ATTENTIVELY ALL THE TIME, NUDGED ME WITH HIS ELBOW.

‚ÄÚWHY, OF COURSE. A LITTLE ROSY BABY WITH TINY LITTLE NAILS, AND MY ONLY GRIEF IS I CAN‚ÄÔT REMEMBER WHETHER IT WAS A BOY OR A GIRL. SOMETIMES I REMEMBER IT WAS A BOY, AND SOMETIMES IT WAS A GIRL. AND WHEN HE WAS BORN, I WRAPPED HIM IN CAMBRIC AND LACE, AND PUT PINK RIBBONS ON HIM, STREWED HIM WITH FLOWERS, GOT HIM READY, SAID PRAYERS OVER HIM. I TOOK HIM AWAY UN-CHRISTENED AND CARRIED HIM THROUGH THE FOREST, AND I WAS AFRAID OF THE FOREST, AND I WAS FRIGHTENED, AND WHAT I WEEP FOR MOST IS THAT I HAD A BABY AND I NEVER HAD A HUSBAND.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPERHAPS YOU HAD ONE?‚ÄÙ SHATOV QUERIED CAUTIOUSLY.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE ABSURD, SHATUSHKA, WITH YOUR REFLECTIONS. I HAD, PERHAPS I HAD, BUT WHAT‚ÄÔS THE USE OF MY HAVING HAD ONE, IF IT‚ÄÔS JUST THE SAME AS THOUGH I HADN‚ÄÔT. THERE‚ÄÔS AN EASY RIDDLE FOR YOU. GUESS IT!‚ÄÙ SHE LAUGHED.

‚ÄÚWHERE DID YOU TAKE YOUR BABY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI TOOK IT TO THE POND,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID WITH A SIGH.

SHATOV NUDGED ME AGAIN.

‚ÄÚAND WHAT IF YOU NEVER HAD A BABY AND ALL THIS IS ONLY A WILD DREAM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ASK ME A HARD QUESTION, SHATUSHKA,‚ÄÙ SHE ANSWERED DREAMILY, WITHOUT A TRACE OF SURPRISE AT SUCH A QUESTION. ‚ÄÚI CAN‚ÄÔT TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT THAT, PERHAPS I HADN‚ÄÔT; I THINK THAT‚ÄÔS ONLY YOUR CURIOSITY. I SHAN‚ÄÔT LEAVE OFF CRYING FOR HIM ANYWAY, I COULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE DREAMT IT.‚ÄÙ AND BIG TEARS GLITTERED IN HER EYES. ‚ÄÚSHATUSHKA, SHATUSHKA, IS IT TRUE THAT YOUR WIFE RAN AWAY FROM YOU?‚ÄÙ

SHE SUDDENLY PUT BOTH HANDS ON HIS SHOULDERS, AND LOOKED AT HIM PITYINGLY. ‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT BE ANGRY, I FEEL SICK MYSELF. DO YOU KNOW, SHATUSHKA, I‚ÄÔVE HAD A DREAM: HE CAME TO ME AGAIN, HE BECKONED ME, CALLED ME. ‚ÄÒMY LITTLE PUSS,‚ÄÔ HE CRIED TO ME, ‚ÄÒLITTLE PUSS, COME TO ME!‚ÄÔ AND I WAS MORE DELIGHTED AT THAT ‚ÄÒLITTLE PUSS‚ÄÔ THAN ANYTHING; HE LOVES ME, I THOUGHT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPERHAPS HE WILL COME IN REALITY,‚ÄÙ SHATOV MUTTERED IN AN UNDERTONE.

‚ÄÚNO, SHATUSHKA, THAT‚ÄÔS A DREAM.‚Ä¶ HE CAN‚ÄÔT COME IN REALITY. YOU KNOW THE SONG:

     ‚ÄÒA NEW FINE HOUSE I DO NOT CRAVE,
     THIS TINY CELL‚ÄÔS ENOUGH FOR ME;
     THERE WILL I DWELL MY SOUL TO SAVE
     AND EVER PRAY TO GOD FOR THEE.‚ÄÔ
ACH, SHATUSHKA, SHATUSHKA, MY DEAR, WHY DO YOU NEVER ASK ME ABOUT ANYTHING?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, YOU WON‚ÄÔT TELL. THAT‚ÄÔS WHY I DON‚ÄÔT ASK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WON‚ÄÔT TELL, I WON‚ÄÔT TELL,‚ÄÙ SHE ANSWERED QUICKLY. ‚ÄÚYOU MAY KILL ME, I WON‚ÄÔT TELL. YOU MAY BURN ME, I WON‚ÄÔT TELL. AND WHATEVER I HAD TO BEAR I‚ÄÔD NEVER TELL, PEOPLE WON‚ÄÔT FIND OUT!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHERE, YOU SEE. EVERY ONE HAS SOMETHING OF THEIR OWN,‚ÄÙ SHATOV SAID, STILL MORE SOFTLY, HIS HEAD DROOPING LOWER AND LOWER.

‚ÄÚBUT IF YOU WERE TO ASK PERHAPS I SHOULD TELL, PERHAPS I SHOULD!‚ÄÙ SHE REPEATED ECSTATICALLY. ‚ÄÚWHY DON‚ÄÔT YOU ASK? ASK, ASK ME NICELY, SHATUSHKA, PERHAPS I SHALL TELL YOU. ENTREAT ME, SHATUSHKA, SO THAT I SHALL CONSENT OF MYSELF. SHATUSHKA, SHATUSHKA!‚ÄÙ

BUT SHATUSHKA WAS SILENT. THERE WAS COMPLETE SILENCE LASTING A MINUTE. TEARS SLOWLY TRICKLED DOWN HER PAINTED CHEEKS. SHE SAT FORGETTING HER TWO HANDS ON SHATOV‚ÄÔS SHOULDERS, BUT NO LONGER LOOKING AT HIM.

‚ÄÚACH, WHAT IS IT TO DO WITH ME, AND IT‚ÄÔS A SIN.‚ÄÙ SHATOV SUDDENLY GOT UP FROM THE BENCH.

‚ÄÚGET UP!‚ÄÙ HE ANGRILY PULLED THE BENCH FROM UNDER ME AND PUT IT BACK WHERE IT STOOD BEFORE.

‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔLL BE COMING, SO WE MUST MIND HE DOESN‚ÄÔT GUESS. IT‚ÄÔS TIME WE WERE OFF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚACH, YOU‚ÄÔRE TALKING OF MY FOOTMAN,‚ÄÙ MARYA TIMOFYEVNA LAUGHED SUDDENLY. ‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE AFRAID OF HIM. WELL, GOOD-BYE, DEAR VISITORS, BUT LISTEN FOR ONE MINUTE, I‚ÄÔVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU. THAT NILITCH CAME HERE WITH FILIPOV, THE LANDLORD, A RED BEARD, AND MY FELLOW HAD FLOWN AT ME JUST THEN, SO THE LANDLORD CAUGHT HOLD OF HIM AND PULLED HIM ABOUT THE ROOM WHILE HE SHOUTED ‚ÄÒIT‚ÄÔS NOT MY FAULT, I‚ÄÔM SUFFERING FOR ANOTHER MAN‚ÄÔS SIN!‚ÄÔ SO WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT, WE ALL BURST OUT LAUGHING.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚACH, TIMOFYEVNA, WHY IT WAS I, NOT THE RED BEARD, IT WAS I PULLED HIM AWAY FROM YOU BY HIS HAIR, THIS MORNING; THE LANDLORD CAME THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY TO MAKE A ROW; YOU‚ÄÔVE MIXED IT UP.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSTAY, I REALLY HAVE MIXED IT UP. PERHAPS IT WAS YOU. WHY DISPUTE ABOUT TRIFLES? WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO HIM WHO IT IS GIVES HIM A BEATING?‚ÄÙ SHE LAUGHED.

‚ÄÚCOME ALONG!‚ÄÙ SHATOV PULLED ME. ‚ÄÚTHE GATE‚ÄÔS CREAKING, HE‚ÄÔLL FIND US AND BEAT HER.‚ÄÙ

AND BEFORE WE HAD TIME TO RUN OUT ON TO THE STAIRS WE HEARD A DRUNKEN SHOUT AND A SHOWER OF OATHS AT THE GATE.

SHATOV LET ME INTO HIS ROOM AND LOCKED THE DOOR.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔLL HAVE TO STAY A MINUTE IF YOU DON‚ÄÔT WANT A SCENE. HE‚ÄÔS SQUEALING LIKE A LITTLE PIG, HE MUST HAVE STUMBLED OVER THE GATE AGAIN. HE FALLS FLAT EVERY TIME.‚ÄÙ

WE DIDN‚ÄÔT GET OFF WITHOUT A SCENE, HOWEVER.

VI

SHATOV STOOD AT THE CLOSED DOOR OF HIS ROOM AND LISTENED; SUDDENLY HE SPRANG BACK.

‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS COMING HERE, I KNEW HE WOULD,‚ÄÙ HE WHISPERED FURIOUSLY. ‚ÄÚNOW THERE‚ÄÔLL BE NO GETTING RID OF HIM TILL MIDNIGHT.‚ÄÙ

SEVERAL VIOLENT THUMPS OF A FIST ON THE DOOR FOLLOWED.

‚ÄÚSHATOV, SHATOV, OPEN!‚ÄÙ YELLED THE CAPTAIN. ‚ÄÚSHATOV, FRIEND!

    ‚ÄÒI HAVE COME, TO THEE TO TELL THEE
     THAT THE SUN DOTH R-R-RISE APACE,
     THAT THE FOREST GLOWS AND TR-R-REMBLES
     IN ‚Ä¶ THE FIRE OF ‚Ä¶ HIS ‚Ä¶ EMBRACE.
     TELL THEE I HAVE WAKED, GOD DAMN THEE,
     WAKENED UNDER THE BIRCH-TWIGS.‚Ä¶‚ÄÔ
(‚ÄÚAS IT MIGHT BE UNDER THE BIRCH-RODS, HA HA!‚ÄÙ)

    ‚ÄÒEVERY LITTLE BIRD ‚Ä¶ IS ‚Ä¶ THIRSTY,
     SAYS I‚ÄÔM GOING TO ‚Ä¶ HAVE A DRINK,
     BUT I DON‚ÄÔT ‚Ä¶ KNOW WHAT TO DRINK.‚Ä¶‚ÄÔ
‚ÄÚDAMN HIS STUPID CURIOSITY! SHATOV, DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW GOOD IT IS TO BE ALIVE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT ANSWER!‚ÄÙ SHATOV WHISPERED TO ME AGAIN.

‚ÄÚOPEN THE DOOR! DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THERE‚ÄÔS SOMETHING HIGHER THAN BRAWLING ‚Ä¶ IN MANKIND; THERE ARE MOMENTS OF AN HON-HON-HONOURABLE MAN.‚Ä¶ SHATOV, I‚ÄÔM GOOD; I‚ÄÔLL FORGIVE YOU.‚Ä¶ SHATOV, DAMN THE MANIFESTOES, EH?‚ÄÙ

SILENCE.

‚ÄÚDO YOU UNDERSTAND, YOU ASS, THAT I‚ÄÔM IN LOVE, THAT I‚ÄÔVE BOUGHT A DRESS-COAT, LOOK, THE GARB OF LOVE, FIFTEEN ROUBLES; A CAPTAIN‚ÄÔS LOVE CALLS FOR THE NICETIES OF STYLE.‚Ä¶ OPEN THE DOOR!‚ÄÙ HE ROARED SAVAGELY ALL OF A SUDDEN, AND HE BEGAN FURIOUSLY BANGING WITH HIS FISTS AGAIN.

‚ÄÚGO TO HELL!‚ÄÙ SHATOV ROARED SUDDENLY.

‚ÄÚS-S-SLAVE! BOND-SLAVE, AND YOUR SISTER‚ÄÔS A SLAVE, A BONDSWOMAN ‚Ä¶ A TH ‚Ä¶ TH ‚Ä¶ IEF!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND YOU SOLD YOUR SISTER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS A LIE! I PUT UP WITH THE LIBEL THOUGH. I COULD WITH ONE WORD ‚Ä¶ DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE IS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT?‚ÄÙ SHATOV AT ONCE DREW NEAR THE DOOR INQUISITIVELY.

‚ÄÚBUT WILL YOU UNDERSTAND?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, I SHALL UNDERSTAND, TELL ME WHAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM NOT AFRAID TO SAY! I‚ÄÔM NEVER AFRAID TO SAY ANYTHING IN PUBLIC!‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU NOT AFRAID? A LIKELY STORY,‚ÄÙ SAID SHATOV, TAUNTING HIM, AND NODDING TO ME TO LISTEN.

‚ÄÚME AFRAID?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, I THINK YOU ARE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚME AFRAID?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL THEN, TELL AWAY IF YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT AFRAID OF YOUR MASTER‚ÄÔS WHIP.‚Ä¶ YOU‚ÄÔRE A COWARD, THOUGH YOU ARE A CAPTAIN!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI ‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶ SHE‚ÄÔS ‚Ä¶ SHE‚ÄÔS ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ FALTERED LEBYADKIN IN A VOICE SHAKING WITH EXCITEMENT.

‚ÄÚWELL?‚ÄÙ SHATOV PUT HIS EAR TO THE DOOR.

A SILENCE FOLLOWED, LASTING AT LEAST HALF A MINUTE.

‚ÄÚSC-OU-OUNDREL!‚ÄÙ CAME FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR AT LAST, AND THE CAPTAIN HURRIEDLY BEAT A RETREAT DOWNSTAIRS, PUFFING LIKE A SAMOVAR, STUMBLING ON EVERY STEP.

‚ÄÚYES, HE‚ÄÔS A SLY ONE, AND WON‚ÄÔT GIVE HIMSELF AWAY EVEN WHEN HE‚ÄÔS DRUNK.‚ÄÙ

SHATOV MOVED AWAY FROM THE DOOR.

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS IT ALL ABOUT?‚ÄÙ I ASKED.

SHATOV WAVED ASIDE THE QUESTION, OPENED THE DOOR AND BEGAN LISTENING ON THE STAIRS AGAIN. HE LISTENED A LONG WHILE, AND EVEN STEALTHILY DESCENDED A FEW STEPS. AT LAST HE CAME BACK.

‚ÄÚTHERE‚ÄÔS NOTHING TO BE HEARD; HE ISN‚ÄÔT BEATING HER; HE MUST HAVE FLOPPED DOWN AT ONCE TO GO TO SLEEP. IT‚ÄÔS TIME FOR YOU TO GO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLISTEN, SHATOV, WHAT AM I TO GATHER FROM ALL THIS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, GATHER WHAT YOU LIKE!‚ÄÙ HE ANSWERED IN A WEARY AND DISGUSTED VOICE, AND HE SAT DOWN TO HIS WRITING-TABLE.

I WENT AWAY. AN IMPROBABLE IDEA WAS GROWING STRONGER AND STRONGER IN MY MIND. I THOUGHT OF THE NEXT DAY WITH DISTRESS.‚Ä¶

VII

THIS ‚ÄÚNEXT DAY,‚ÄÙ THE VERY SUNDAY WHICH WAS TO DECIDE STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS FATE IRREVOCABLY, WAS ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE DAYS IN MY CHRONICLE. IT WAS A DAY OF SURPRISES, A DAY THAT SOLVED PAST RIDDLES AND SUGGESTED NEW ONES, A DAY OF STARTLING REVELATIONS, AND STILL MORE HOPELESS PERPLEXITY. IN THE MORNING, AS THE READER IS ALREADY AWARE, I HAD BY VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS PARTICULAR REQUEST TO ACCOMPANY MY FRIEND ON HIS VISIT TO HER, AND AT THREE O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON I HAD TO BE WITH LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA IN ORDER TO TELL HER‚ÄÎI DID NOT KNOW WHAT‚ÄÎAND TO ASSIST HER‚ÄÎI DID NOT KNOW HOW. AND MEANWHILE IT ALL ENDED AS NO ONE COULD HAVE EXPECTED. IN A WORD, IT WAS A DAY OF WONDERFUL COINCIDENCES.

TO BEGIN WITH, WHEN STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH AND I ARRIVED AT VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS AT TWELVE O‚ÄÔCLOCK PUNCTUALLY, THE TIME SHE HAD FIXED, WE DID NOT FIND HER AT HOME; SHE HAD NOT YET COME BACK FROM CHURCH. MY POOR FRIEND WAS SO DISPOSED, OR, MORE ACCURATELY SPEAKING, SO INDISPOSED THAT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE CRUSHED HIM AT ONCE; HE SANK ALMOST HELPLESS INTO AN ARM-CHAIR IN THE DRAWING-ROOM. I SUGGESTED A GLASS OF WATER; BUT IN SPITE OF HIS PALLOR AND THE TREMBLING OF HIS HANDS, HE REFUSED IT WITH DIGNITY. HIS GET-UP FOR THE OCCASION WAS, BY THE WAY, EXTREMELY RECHERCH√©: A SHIRT OF BATISTE AND EMBROIDERED, ALMOST FIT FOR A BALL, A WHITE TIE, A NEW HAT IN HIS HAND, NEW STRAW-COLOURED GLOVES, AND EVEN A SUSPICION OF SCENT. WE HAD HARDLY SAT DOWN WHEN SHATOV WAS SHOWN IN BY THE BUTLER, OBVIOUSLY ALSO BY OFFICIAL INVITATION. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS RISING TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM, BUT SHATOV, AFTER LOOKING ATTENTIVELY AT US BOTH, TURNED AWAY INTO A CORNER, AND SAT DOWN THERE WITHOUT EVEN NODDING TO US. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH LOOKED AT ME IN DISMAY AGAIN.

WE SAT LIKE THIS FOR SOME MINUTES LONGER IN COMPLETE SILENCE. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SUDDENLY BEGAN WHISPERING SOMETHING TO ME VERY QUICKLY, BUT I COULD NOT CATCH IT; AND INDEED, HE WAS SO AGITATED HIMSELF THAT HE BROKE OFF WITHOUT FINISHING. THE BUTLER CAME IN ONCE MORE, OSTENSIBLY TO SET SOMETHING STRAIGHT ON THE TABLE, MORE PROBABLY TO TAKE A LOOK AT US.

SHATOV SUDDENLY ADDRESSED HIM WITH A LOUD QUESTION:

‚ÄÚALEXEY YEGORYTCH, DO YOU KNOW WHETHER DARYA PAVLOVNA HAS GONE WITH HER?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚVARVARA PETROVNA WAS PLEASED TO DRIVE TO THE CATHEDRAL ALONE, AND DARYA PAVLOVNA WAS PLEASED TO REMAIN IN HER ROOM UPSTAIRS, BEING INDISPOSED,‚ÄÙ ALEXEY YEGORYTCH ANNOUNCED FORMALLY AND REPROVINGLY.

MY POOR FRIEND AGAIN STOLE A HURRIED AND AGITATED GLANCE AT ME, SO THAT AT LAST I TURNED AWAY FROM HIM. SUDDENLY A CARRIAGE RUMBLED AT THE ENTRANCE, AND SOME COMMOTION AT A DISTANCE IN THE HOUSE MADE US AWARE OF THE LADY‚ÄÔS RETURN. WE ALL LEAPT UP FROM OUR EASY CHAIRS, BUT AGAIN A SURPRISE AWAITED US; WE HEARD THE NOISE OF MANY FOOTSTEPS, SO OUR HOSTESS MUST HAVE RETURNED NOT ALONE, AND THIS CERTAINLY WAS RATHER STRANGE, SINCE SHE HAD FIXED THAT TIME HERSELF. FINALLY, WE HEARD SOME ONE COME IN WITH STRANGE RAPIDITY AS THOUGH RUNNING, IN A WAY THAT VARVARA PETROVNA COULD NOT HAVE COME IN. AND, ALL AT ONCE SHE ALMOST FLEW INTO THE ROOM, PANTING AND EXTREMELY AGITATED. AFTER HER A LITTLE LATER AND MUCH MORE QUICKLY LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA CAME IN, AND WITH HER, HAND IN HAND, MARYA TIMOFYEVNA LEBYADKIN! IF I HAD SEEN THIS IN MY DREAMS, EVEN THEN I SHOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT.

TO EXPLAIN THEIR UTTERLY UNEXPECTED APPEARANCE, I MUST GO BACK AN HOUR AND DESCRIBE MORE IN DETAIL AN EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURE WHICH HAD BEFALLEN VARVARA PETROVNA IN CHURCH.

IN THE FIRST PLACE ALMOST THE WHOLE TOWN, THAT IS, OF COURSE, ALL OF THE UPPER STRATUM OF SOCIETY, WERE ASSEMBLED IN THE CATHEDRAL. IT WAS KNOWN THAT THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE WAS TO MAKE HER APPEARANCE THERE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HER ARRIVAL AMONGST US. I MUST MENTION THAT THERE WERE ALREADY RUMOURS THAT SHE WAS A FREE-THINKER, AND A FOLLOWER OF ‚ÄÚTHE NEW PRINCIPLES.‚ÄÙ ALL THE LADIES WERE ALSO AWARE THAT SHE WOULD BE DRESSED WITH MAGNIFICENCE AND EXTRAORDINARY ELEGANCE. AND SO THE COSTUMES OF OUR LADIES WERE ELABORATE AND GORGEOUS FOR THE OCCASION.

ONLY VARVARA PETROVNA WAS MODESTLY DRESSED IN BLACK AS SHE ALWAYS WAS, AND HAD BEEN FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS. SHE HAD TAKEN HER USUAL PLACE IN CHURCH IN THE FIRST ROW ON THE LEFT, AND A FOOTMAN IN LIVERY HAD PUT DOWN A VELVET CUSHION FOR HER TO KNEEL ON; EVERYTHING IN FACT, HAD BEEN AS USUAL. BUT IT WAS NOTICED, TOO, THAT ALL THROUGH THE SERVICE SHE PRAYED WITH EXTREME FERVOUR. IT WAS EVEN ASSERTED AFTERWARDS WHEN PEOPLE RECALLED IT, THAT SHE HAD HAD TEARS IN HER EYES. THE SERVICE WAS OVER AT LAST, AND OUR CHIEF PRIEST, FATHER PAVEL, CAME OUT TO DELIVER A SOLEMN SERMON. WE LIKED HIS SERMONS AND THOUGHT VERY HIGHLY OF THEM. WE USED EVEN TO TRY TO PERSUADE HIM TO PRINT THEM, BUT HE NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND TO. ON THIS OCCASION THE SERMON WAS A PARTICULARLY LONG ONE.

AND BEHOLD, DURING THE SERMON A LADY DROVE UP TO THE CHURCH IN AN OLD FASHIONED HIRED DROSHKY, THAT IS, ONE IN WHICH THE LADY COULD ONLY SIT SIDEWAYS, HOLDING ON TO THE DRIVER‚ÄÔS SASH, SHAKING AT EVERY JOLT LIKE A BLADE OF GRASS IN THE BREEZE. SUCH DROSHKYS ARE STILL TO BE SEEN IN OUR TOWN. STOPPING AT THE CORNER OF THE CATHEDRAL‚ÄÎFOR THERE WERE A NUMBER OF CARRIAGES, AND MOUNTED POLICE TOO, AT THE GATES‚ÄÎTHE LADY SPRANG OUT OF THE DROSHKY AND HANDED THE DRIVER FOUR KOPECKS IN SILVER.

‚ÄÚISN‚ÄÔT IT ENOUGH, VANYA?‚ÄÙ SHE CRIED, SEEING HIS GRIMACE. ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS ALL I‚ÄÔVE GOT,‚ÄÙ SHE ADDED PLAINTIVELY.

‚ÄÚWELL, THERE, BLESS YOU. I TOOK YOU WITHOUT FIXING THE PRICE,‚ÄÙ SAID THE DRIVER WITH A HOPELESS GESTURE, AND LOOKING AT HER HE ADDED AS THOUGH REFLECTING:

‚ÄÚAND IT WOULD BE A SIN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU TOO.‚ÄÙ

THEN, THRUSTING HIS LEATHER PURSE INTO HIS BOSOM, HE TOUCHED UP HIS HORSE AND DROVE OFF, FOLLOWED BY THE JEERS OF THE DRIVERS STANDING NEAR. JEERS, AND WONDER TOO, FOLLOWED THE LADY AS SHE MADE HER WAY TO THE CATHEDRAL GATES, BETWEEN THE CARRIAGES AND THE FOOTMEN WAITING FOR THEIR MASTERS TO COME OUT. AND INDEED, THERE CERTAINLY WAS SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY AND SURPRISING TO EVERY ONE IN SUCH A PERSON‚ÄÔS SUDDENLY APPEARING IN THE STREET AMONG PEOPLE. SHE WAS PAINFULLY THIN AND SHE LIMPED, SHE WAS HEAVILY POWDERED AND ROUGED; HER LONG NECK WAS QUITE BARE, SHE HAD NEITHER KERCHIEF NOR PELISSE; SHE HAD NOTHING ON BUT AN OLD DARK DRESS IN SPITE OF THE COLD AND WINDY, THOUGH BRIGHT, SEPTEMBER DAY. SHE WAS BAREHEADED, AND HER HAIR WAS TWISTED UP INTO A TINY KNOT, AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF IT WAS STUCK AN ARTIFICIAL ROSE, SUCH AS ARE USED TO DEDICATE CHERUBS SOLD IN PALM WEEK. I HAD NOTICED JUST SUCH A ONE WITH A WREATH OF PAPER ROSES IN A CORNER UNDER THE IKONS WHEN I WAS AT MARYA TIMOFYEVNA‚ÄÔS THE DAY BEFORE. TO PUT A FINISHING-TOUCH TO IT, THOUGH THE LADY WALKED WITH MODESTLY DOWNCAST EYES THERE WAS A SLY AND MERRY SMILE ON HER FACE. IF SHE HAD LINGERED A MOMENT LONGER, SHE WOULD PERHAPS NOT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO ENTER THE CATHEDRAL. BUT SHE SUCCEEDED IN SLIPPING BY, AND ENTERING THE BUILDING, GRADUALLY PRESSED FORWARD.

THOUGH IT WAS HALF-WAY THROUGH THE SERMON, AND THE DENSE CROWD THAT FILLED THE CATHEDRAL WAS LISTENING TO IT WITH ABSORBED AND SILENT ATTENTION, YET SEVERAL PAIRS OF EYES GLANCED WITH CURIOSITY AND AMAZEMENT AT THE NEW-COMER. SHE SANK ON TO THE FLOOR, BOWED HER PAINTED FACE DOWN TO IT, LAY THERE A LONG TIME, UNMISTAKABLY WEEPING; BUT RAISING HER HEAD AGAIN AND GETTING UP FROM HER KNEES, SHE SOON RECOVERED, AND WAS DIVERTED. GAILY AND WITH EVIDENT AND INTENSE ENJOYMENT SHE LET HER EYES ROVE OVER THE FACES, AND OVER THE WALLS OF THE CATHEDRAL. SHE LOOKED WITH PARTICULAR CURIOSITY AT SOME OF THE LADIES, EVEN STANDING ON TIP-TOE TO LOOK AT THEM, AND EVEN LAUGHED ONCE OR TWICE, GIGGLING STRANGELY. BUT THE SERMON WAS OVER, AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE CROSS. THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE WAS THE FIRST TO GO UP TO THE CROSS, BUT SHE STOPPED SHORT TWO STEPS FROM IT, EVIDENTLY WISHING TO MAKE WAY FOR VARVARA PETROVNA, WHO, ON HER SIDE, MOVED TOWARDS IT QUITE DIRECTLY AS THOUGH SHE NOTICED NO ONE IN FRONT OF HER. THERE WAS AN OBVIOUS AND, IN ITS WAY, CLEVER MALICE IMPLIED IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY ACT OF DEFERENCE ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE; EVERY ONE FELT THIS; VARVARA PETROVNA MUST HAVE FELT IT TOO; BUT SHE WENT ON AS BEFORE, APPARENTLY NOTICING NO ONE, AND WITH THE SAME UNFALTERING AIR OF DIGNITY KISSED THE CROSS, AND AT ONCE TURNED TO LEAVE THE CATHEDRAL. A FOOTMAN IN LIVERY CLEARED THE WAY FOR HER, THOUGH EVERY ONE STEPPED BACK SPONTANEOUSLY TO LET HER PASS. BUT JUST AS SHE WAS GOING OUT, IN THE PORCH THE CLOSELY PACKED MASS OF PEOPLE BLOCKED THE WAY FOR A MOMENT. VARVARA PETROVNA STOOD STILL, AND SUDDENLY A STRANGE, EXTRAORDINARY CREATURE, THE WOMAN WITH THE PAPER ROSE ON HER HEAD, SQUEEZED THROUGH THE PEOPLE, AND FELL ON HER KNEES BEFORE HER. VARVARA PETROVNA, WHO WAS NOT EASILY DISCONCERTED, ESPECIALLY IN PUBLIC, LOOKED AT HER STERNLY AND WITH DIGNITY.

I HASTEN TO OBSERVE HERE, AS BRIEFLY AS POSSIBLE, THAT THOUGH VARVARA PETROVNA HAD BECOME, IT WAS SAID, EXCESSIVELY CAREFUL AND EVEN STINGY, YET SOMETIMES SHE WAS NOT SPARING OF MONEY, ESPECIALLY FOR BENEVOLENT OBJECTS. SHE WAS A MEMBER OF A CHARITABLE SOCIETY IN THE CAPITAL. IN THE LAST FAMINE YEAR SHE HAD SENT FIVE HUNDRED ROUBLES TO THE CHIEF COMMITTEE FOR THE RELIEF OF THE SUFFERERS, AND PEOPLE TALKED OF IT IN THE TOWN. MOREOVER, JUST BEFORE THE APPOINTMENT OF THE NEW GOVERNOR, SHE HAD BEEN ON THE VERY POINT OF FOUNDING A LOCAL COMMITTEE OF LADIES TO ASSIST THE POOREST MOTHERS IN THE TOWN AND IN THE PROVINCE. SHE WAS SEVERELY CENSURED AMONG US FOR AMBITION; BUT VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS WELL-KNOWN STRENUOUSNESS AND, AT THE SAME TIME, HER PERSISTENCE NEARLY TRIUMPHED OVER ALL OBSTACLES. THE SOCIETY WAS ALMOST FORMED, AND THE ORIGINAL IDEA EMBRACED A WIDER AND WIDER SCOPE IN THE ENTHUSIASTIC MIND OF THE FOUNDRESS. SHE WAS ALREADY DREAMING OF FOUNDING A SIMILAR SOCIETY IN MOSCOW, AND THE GRADUAL EXPANSION OF ITS INFLUENCE OVER ALL THE PROVINCES OF RUSSIA. AND NOW, WITH THE SUDDEN CHANGE OF GOVERNOR, EVERYTHING WAS AT A STANDSTILL; AND THE NEW GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE HAD, IT WAS SAID, ALREADY UTTERED IN SOCIETY SOME BITING, AND, WHAT WAS WORSE, APT AND SENSIBLE REMARKS ABOUT THE IMPRACTICABILITY OF THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEA OF SUCH A COMMITTEE, WHICH WAS, WITH ADDITIONS OF COURSE, REPEATED TO VARVARA PETROVNA. GOD ALONE KNOWS THE SECRETS OF MEN‚ÄÔS HEARTS; BUT I IMAGINE THAT VARVARA PETROVNA STOOD STILL NOW AT THE VERY CATHEDRAL GATES POSITIVELY WITH A CERTAIN PLEASURE, KNOWING THAT THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE AND, AFTER HER, ALL THE CONGREGATION, WOULD HAVE TO PASS BY IMMEDIATELY, AND ‚ÄÚLET HER SEE FOR HERSELF HOW LITTLE I CARE WHAT SHE THINKS, AND WHAT POINTED THINGS SHE SAYS ABOUT THE VANITY OF MY BENEVOLENCE. SO MUCH FOR ALL OF YOU!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT IS IT MY DEAR? WHAT ARE YOU ASKING?‚ÄÙ SAID VARVARA PETROVNA, LOOKING MORE ATTENTIVELY AT THE KNEELING WOMAN BEFORE HER, WHO GAZED AT HER WITH A FEARFULLY PANIC-STRICKEN, SHAME-FACED, BUT ALMOST REVERENT EXPRESSION, AND SUDDENLY BROKE INTO THE SAME STRANGE GIGGLE.

‚ÄÚWHAT DOES SHE WANT? WHO IS SHE?‚ÄÙ

VARVARA PETROVNA BENT AN IMPERIOUS AND INQUIRING GAZE ON ALL AROUND HER. EVERY ONE WAS SILENT.

‚ÄÚYOU ARE UNHAPPY? YOU ARE IN NEED OF HELP?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM IN NEED.‚Ä¶ I HAVE COME ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ FALTERED THE ‚ÄÚUNHAPPY‚ÄÙ CREATURE, IN A VOICE BROKEN WITH EMOTION. ‚ÄÚI HAVE COME ONLY TO KISS YOUR HAND.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

AGAIN SHE GIGGLED. WITH THE CHILDISH LOOK WITH WHICH LITTLE CHILDREN CARESS SOMEONE, BEGGING FOR A FAVOUR, SHE STRETCHED FORWARD TO SEIZE VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS HAND, BUT, AS THOUGH PANIC-STRICKEN, DREW HER HANDS BACK.

‚ÄÚIS THAT ALL YOU HAVE COME FOR?‚ÄÙ SAID VARVARA PETROVNA, WITH A COMPASSIONATE SMILE; BUT AT ONCE SHE DREW HER MOTHER-OF-PEARL PURSE OUT OF HER POCKET, TOOK OUT A TEN-ROUBLE NOTE AND GAVE IT TO THE UNKNOWN. THE LATTER TOOK IT. VARVARA PETROVNA WAS MUCH INTERESTED AND EVIDENTLY DID NOT LOOK UPON HER AS AN ORDINARY LOW-CLASS BEGGAR.

‚ÄÚI SAY, SHE GAVE HER TEN ROUBLES!‚ÄÙ SOMEONE SAID IN THE CROWD.

‚ÄÚLET ME KISS YOUR HAND,‚ÄÙ FALTERED THE UNKNOWN, HOLDING TIGHT IN THE FINGERS OF HER LEFT HAND THE CORNER OF THE TEN-ROUBLE NOTE, WHICH FLUTTERED IN THE DRAUGHT. VARVARA PETROVNA FROWNED SLIGHTLY, AND WITH A SERIOUS, ALMOST SEVERE, FACE HELD OUT HER HAND. THE CRIPPLE KISSED IT WITH REVERENCE. HER GRATEFUL EYES SHONE WITH POSITIVE ECSTASY. AT THAT MOMENT THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE CAME UP, AND A WHOLE CROWD OF LADIES AND HIGH OFFICIALS FLOCKED AFTER HER. THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE WAS FORCED TO STAND STILL FOR A MOMENT IN THE CRUSH; MANY PEOPLE STOPPED.

‚ÄÚYOU ARE TREMBLING. ARE YOU COLD?‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA OBSERVED SUDDENLY, AND FLINGING OFF HER PELISSE WHICH A FOOTMAN CAUGHT IN MID-AIR, SHE TOOK FROM HER OWN SHOULDERS A VERY EXPENSIVE BLACK SHAWL, AND WITH HER OWN HANDS WRAPPED IT ROUND THE BARE NECK OF THE STILL KNEELING WOMAN.

‚ÄÚBUT GET UP, GET UP FROM YOUR KNEES I BEG YOU!‚ÄÙ

THE WOMAN GOT UP.

‚ÄÚWHERE DO YOU LIVE? IS IT POSSIBLE NO ONE KNOWS WHERE SHE LIVES?‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA GLANCED ROUND IMPATIENTLY AGAIN. BUT THE CROWD WAS DIFFERENT NOW: SHE SAW ONLY THE FACES OF ACQUAINTANCES, PEOPLE IN SOCIETY, SURVEYING THE SCENE, SOME WITH SEVERE ASTONISHMENT, OTHERS WITH SLY CURIOSITY AND AT THE SAME TIME GUILELESS EAGERNESS FOR A SENSATION, WHILE OTHERS POSITIVELY LAUGHED.

‚ÄÚI BELIEVE HER NAME‚ÄÔS LEBYADKIN,‚ÄÙ A GOOD-NATURED PERSON VOLUNTEERED AT LAST IN ANSWER TO VARVARA PETROVNA. IT WAS OUR RESPECTABLE AND RESPECTED MERCHANT ANDREEV, A MAN IN SPECTACLES WITH A GREY BEARD, WEARING RUSSIAN DRESS AND HOLDING A HIGH ROUND HAT IN HIS HANDS. ‚ÄÚTHEY LIVE IN THE FILIPOVS‚ÄÔ HOUSE IN BOGOYAVLENSKY STREET.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLEBYADKIN? FILIPOVS‚ÄÔ HOUSE? I HAVE HEARD SOMETHING.‚Ä¶ THANK YOU, NIKON SEMYONITCH. BUT WHO IS THIS LEBYADKIN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE CALLS HIMSELF A CAPTAIN, A MAN, IT MUST BE SAID, NOT OVER CAREFUL IN HIS BEHAVIOUR. AND NO DOUBT THIS IS HIS SISTER. SHE MUST HAVE ESCAPED FROM UNDER CONTROL,‚ÄÙ NIKON SEMYONITCH WENT ON, DROPPING HIS VOICE, AND GLANCING SIGNIFICANTLY AT VARVARA PETROVNA.

‚ÄÚI UNDERSTAND. THANK YOU, NIKON SEMYONITCH. YOUR NAME IS MLLE. LEBYADKIN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, MY NAME‚ÄÔS NOT LEBYADKIN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEN PERHAPS YOUR BROTHER‚ÄÔS NAME IS LEBYADKIN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMY BROTHER‚ÄÔS NAME IS LEBYADKIN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHIS IS WHAT I‚ÄÔLL DO, I‚ÄÔLL TAKE YOU WITH ME NOW, MY DEAR, AND YOU SHALL BE DRIVEN FROM ME TO YOUR FAMILY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO WITH ME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚACH, I SHOULD!‚ÄÙ CRIED MLLE. LEBYADKIN, CLASPING HER HANDS.

‚ÄÚAUNTIE, AUNTIE, TAKE ME WITH YOU TOO!‚ÄÙ THE VOICE OF LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA CRIED SUDDENLY.

I MUST OBSERVE THAT LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA HAD COME TO THE CATHEDRAL WITH THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE, WHILE PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA HAD BY THE DOCTOR‚ÄÔS ORDERS GONE FOR A DRIVE IN HER CARRIAGE, TAKING MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH TO ENTERTAIN HER. LIZA SUDDENLY LEFT THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE AND RAN UP TO VARVARA PETROVNA.

‚ÄÚMY DEAR, YOU KNOW I‚ÄÔM ALWAYS GLAD TO HAVE YOU, BUT WHAT WILL YOUR MOTHER SAY?‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA BEGAN MAJESTICALLY, BUT SHE BECAME SUDDENLY CONFUSED, NOTICING LIZA‚ÄÔS EXTRAORDINARY AGITATION.

‚ÄÚAUNTIE, AUNTIE, I MUST COME WITH YOU!‚ÄÙ LIZA IMPLORED, KISSING VARVARA PETROVNA.

‚ÄÚMAIS QU‚ÄÔAVEZ VOUS DONC, LISE?‚ÄÙ THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE ASKED WITH EXPRESSIVE WONDER.

‚ÄÚAH, FORGIVE ME, DARLING, CH√®RE COUSINE, I‚ÄÔM GOING TO AUNTIE‚ÄÔS.‚ÄÙ

LIZA TURNED IN PASSING TO HER UNPLEASANTLY SURPRISED CH√®RE COUSINE, AND KISSED HER TWICE.

‚ÄÚAND TELL MAMAN TO FOLLOW ME TO AUNTIE‚ÄÔS DIRECTLY; MAMAN MEANT, FULLY MEANT TO COME AND SEE YOU, SHE SAID SO THIS MORNING HERSELF, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,‚ÄÙ LIZA PATTERED ON. ‚ÄÚI BEG YOUR PARDON, DON‚ÄÔT BE ANGRY, JULIE, CH√®RE ‚Ä¶ COUSINE.‚Ä¶ AUNTIE, I‚ÄÔM READY!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF YOU DON‚ÄÔT TAKE ME WITH YOU, AUNTIE, I‚ÄÔLL RUN AFTER YOUR CARRIAGE, SCREAMING,‚ÄÙ SHE WHISPERED RAPIDLY AND DESPAIRINGLY IN VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS EAR; IT WAS LUCKY THAT NO ONE HEARD. VARVARA PETROVNA POSITIVELY STAGGERED BACK, AND BENT HER PENETRATING GAZE ON THE MAD GIRL. THAT GAZE SETTLED EVERYTHING. SHE MADE UP HER MIND TO TAKE LIZA WITH HER.

‚ÄÚWE MUST PUT AN END TO THIS!‚ÄÙ BROKE FROM HER LIPS. ‚ÄÚVERY WELL, I‚ÄÔLL TAKE YOU WITH PLEASURE, LIZA,‚ÄÙ SHE ADDED ALOUD, ‚ÄÚIF YULIA MIHAILOVNA IS WILLING TO LET YOU COME, OF COURSE.‚ÄÙ WITH A CANDID AIR AND STRAIGHTFORWARD DIGNITY SHE ADDRESSED THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE DIRECTLY.

‚ÄÚOH, CERTAINLY, I DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO DEPRIVE HER OF SUCH A PLEASURE ESPECIALLY AS I AM MYSELF ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ YULIA MIHAILOVNA LISPED WITH AMAZING AFFABILITY‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚI MYSELF ‚Ä¶ KNOW WELL WHAT A FANTASTIC, WILFUL LITTLE HEAD IT IS!‚ÄÙ YULIA MIHAILOVNA GAVE A CHARMING SMILE.

‚ÄÚI THANK YOU EXTREMELY,‚ÄÙ SAID VARVARA PETROVNA, WITH A COURTEOUS AND DIGNIFIED BOW.

‚ÄÚAND I AM THE MORE GRATIFIED,‚ÄÙ YULIA MIHAILOVNA WENT ON, LISPING ALMOST RAPTUROUSLY, FLUSHING ALL OVER WITH AGREEABLE EXCITEMENT, ‚ÄÚTHAT, APART FROM THE PLEASURE OF BEING WITH YOU LIZA SHOULD BE CARRIED AWAY BY SUCH AN EXCELLENT, I MAY SAY LOFTY, FEELING ‚Ä¶ OF COMPASSION ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ (SHE GLANCED AT THE ‚ÄÚUNHAPPY CREATURE‚ÄÙ) ‚ÄÚAND ‚Ä¶ AND AT THE VERY PORTAL OF THE TEMPLE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSUCH A FEELING DOES YOU HONOUR,‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA APPROVED MAGNIFICENTLY. YULIA MIHAILOVNA IMPULSIVELY HELD OUT HER HAND AND VARVARA PETROVNA WITH PERFECT READINESS TOUCHED IT WITH HER FINGERS. THE GENERAL EFFECT WAS EXCELLENT, THE FACES OF SOME OF THOSE PRESENT BEAMED WITH PLEASURE, SOME BLAND AND INSINUATING SMILES WERE TO BE SEEN.

IN SHORT IT WAS MADE MANIFEST TO EVERY ONE IN THE TOWN THAT IT WAS NOT YULIA MIHAILOVNA WHO HAD UP TILL NOW NEGLECTED VARVARA PETROVNA IN NOT CALLING UPON HER, BUT ON THE CONTRARY THAT VARVARA PETROVNA HAD ‚ÄÚKEPT YULIA MIHAILOVNA WITHIN BOUNDS AT A DISTANCE, WHILE THE LATTER WOULD HAVE HASTENED TO PAY HER A VISIT, GOING ON FOOT PERHAPS IF NECESSARY, HAD SHE BEEN FULLY ASSURED THAT VARVARA PETROVNA WOULD NOT TURN HER AWAY.‚ÄÙ AND VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS PRESTIGE WAS ENORMOUSLY INCREASED.

‚ÄÚGET IN, MY DEAR.‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA MOTIONED MLLE. LEBYADKIN TOWARDS THE CARRIAGE WHICH HAD DRIVEN UP.

THE ‚ÄÚUNHAPPY CREATURE‚ÄÙ HURRIED GLEEFULLY TO THE CARRIAGE DOOR, AND THERE THE FOOTMAN LIFTED HER IN.

‚ÄÚWHAT! YOU‚ÄÔRE LAME!‚ÄÙ CRIED VARVARA PETROVNA, SEEMING QUITE ALARMED, AND SHE TURNED PALE. (EVERY ONE NOTICED IT AT THE TIME, BUT DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT.)

THE CARRIAGE ROLLED AWAY. VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS HOUSE WAS VERY NEAR THE CATHEDRAL. LIZA TOLD ME AFTERWARDS THAT MISS LEBYADKIN LAUGHED HYSTERICALLY FOR THE THREE MINUTES THAT THE DRIVE LASTED, WHILE VARVARA PETROVNA SAT ‚ÄÚAS THOUGH IN A MESMERIC SLEEP.‚ÄÙ LIZA‚ÄÔS OWN EXPRESSION.





CHAPTER V. THE SUBTLE SERPENT

I

VARVARA PETROVNA RANG THE BELL AND THREW HERSELF INTO AN EASY CHAIR BY THE WINDOW.

‚ÄÚSIT HERE, MY DEAR.‚ÄÙ SHE MOTIONED MARYA TIMOFYEVNA TO A SEAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM, BY A LARGE ROUND TABLE. ‚ÄÚSTEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS? SEE, SEE, LOOK AT THIS WOMAN, WHAT IS THE MEANING OF IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI ‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ FALTERED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.

BUT A FOOTMAN CAME IN.

‚ÄÚA CUP OF COFFEE AT ONCE, WE MUST HAVE IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE! KEEP THE HORSES!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMAIS, CH√®RE ET EXCELLENTE AMIE, DANS QUELLE INQUI√©TUDE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH EXCLAIMED IN A DYING VOICE.

‚ÄÚACH! FRENCH! FRENCH! I CAN SEE AT ONCE THAT IT‚ÄÔS THE HIGHEST SOCIETY,‚ÄÙ CRIED MARYA TIMOFYEVNA, CLAPPING HER HANDS, ECSTATICALLY PREPARING HERSELF TO LISTEN TO A CONVERSATION IN FRENCH. VARVARA PETROVNA STARED AT HER ALMOST IN DISMAY.

WE ALL SAT IN SILENCE, WAITING TO SEE HOW IT WOULD END. SHATOV DID NOT LIFT UP HIS HEAD, AND STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS OVERWHELMED WITH CONFUSION AS THOUGH IT WERE ALL HIS FAULT; THE PERSPIRATION STOOD OUT ON HIS TEMPLES. I GLANCED AT LIZA (SHE WAS SITTING IN THE CORNER ALMOST BESIDE SHATOV). HER EYES DARTED KEENLY FROM VARVARA PETROVNA TO THE CRIPPLE AND BACK AGAIN; HER LIPS WERE DRAWN INTO A SMILE, BUT NOT A PLEASANT ONE. VARVARA PETROVNA SAW THAT SMILE. MEANWHILE MARYA TIMOFYEVNA WAS ABSOLUTELY TRANSPORTED. WITH EVIDENT ENJOYMENT AND WITHOUT A TRACE OF EMBARRASSMENT SHE STARED AT VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS BEAUTIFUL DRAWING-ROOM‚ÄÎTHE FURNITURE, THE CARPETS, THE PICTURES ON THE WALLS, THE OLD-FASHIONED PAINTED CEILING, THE GREAT BRONZE CRUCIFIX IN THE CORNER, THE CHINA LAMP, THE ALBUMS, THE OBJECTS ON THE TABLE.

‚ÄÚAND YOU‚ÄÔRE HERE, TOO, SHATUSHKA!‚ÄÙ SHE CRIED SUDDENLY. ‚ÄÚONLY FANCY, I SAW YOU A LONG TIME AGO, BUT I THOUGHT IT COULDN‚ÄÔT BE YOU! HOW COULD YOU COME HERE!‚ÄÙ AND SHE LAUGHED GAILY.

‚ÄÚYOU KNOW THIS WOMAN?‚ÄÙ SAID VARVARA PETROVNA, TURNING TO HIM AT ONCE.

‚ÄÚI KNOW HER,‚ÄÙ MUTTERED SHATOV. HE SEEMED ABOUT TO MOVE FROM HIS CHAIR, BUT REMAINED SITTING.

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU KNOW OF HER? MAKE HASTE, PLEASE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, WELL ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HE STAMMERED WITH AN INCONGRUOUS SMILE. ‚ÄÚYOU SEE FOR YOURSELF.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT DO I SEE? COME NOW, SAY SOMETHING!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSHE LIVES IN THE SAME HOUSE AS I DO ‚Ä¶ WITH HER BROTHER ‚Ä¶ AN OFFICER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL?‚ÄÙ

SHATOV STAMMERED AGAIN.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS NOT WORTH TALKING ABOUT ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HE MUTTERED, AND RELAPSED INTO DETERMINED SILENCE. HE POSITIVELY FLUSHED WITH DETERMINATION.

‚ÄÚOF COURSE ONE CAN EXPECT NOTHING ELSE FROM YOU,‚ÄÙ SAID VARVARA PETROVNA INDIGNANTLY. IT WAS CLEAR TO HER NOW THAT THEY ALL KNEW SOMETHING AND, AT THE SAME TIME, THAT THEY WERE ALL SCARED, THAT THEY WERE EVADING HER QUESTIONS, AND ANXIOUS TO KEEP SOMETHING FROM HER.

THE FOOTMAN CAME IN AND BROUGHT HER, ON A LITTLE SILVER TRAY, THE CUP OF COFFEE SHE HAD SO SPECIALLY ORDERED, BUT AT A SIGN FROM HER MOVED WITH IT AT ONCE TOWARDS MARYA TIMOFYEVNA.

‚ÄÚYOU WERE VERY COLD JUST NOW, MY DEAR; MAKE HASTE AND DRINK IT AND GET WARM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMERCI.‚ÄÙ

MARYA TIMOFYEVNA TOOK THE CUP AND AT ONCE WENT OFF INTO A GIGGLE AT HAVING SAID MERCI TO THE FOOTMAN. BUT MEETING VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS REPROVING EYES, SHE WAS OVERCOME WITH SHYNESS AND PUT THE CUP ON THE TABLE.

‚ÄÚAUNTIE, SURELY YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT ANGRY?‚ÄÙ SHE FALTERED WITH A SORT OF FLIPPANT PLAYFULNESS.

‚ÄÚWH-A-A-T?‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA STARTED, AND DREW HERSELF UP IN HER CHAIR. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM NOT YOUR AUNT. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF?‚ÄÙ

MARYA TIMOFYEVNA, NOT EXPECTING SUCH AN ANGRY OUTBURST, BEGAN TREMBLING ALL OVER IN LITTLE CONVULSIVE SHUDDERS, AS THOUGH SHE WERE IN A FIT, AND SANK BACK IN HER CHAIR.

‚ÄÚI ‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶ THOUGHT THAT WAS THE PROPER WAY,‚ÄÙ SHE FALTERED, GAZING OPEN-EYED AT VARVARA PETROVNA. ‚ÄÚLIZA CALLED YOU THAT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT LIZA?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, THIS YOUNG LADY HERE,‚ÄÙ SAID MARYA TIMOFYEVNA, POINTING WITH HER FINGER.

‚ÄÚSO SHE‚ÄÔS LIZA ALREADY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU CALLED HER THAT YOURSELF JUST NOW,‚ÄÙ SAID MARYA TIMOFYEVNA GROWING A LITTLE BOLDER. ‚ÄÚAND I DREAMED OF A BEAUTY LIKE THAT,‚ÄÙ SHE ADDED, LAUGHING, AS IT WERE ACCIDENTALLY.

VARVARA PETROVNA REFLECTED, AND GREW CALMER, SHE EVEN SMILED FAINTLY AT MARYA TIMOFYEVNA‚ÄÔS LAST WORDS; THE LATTER, CATCHING HER SMILE, GOT UP FROM HER CHAIR, AND LIMPING, WENT TIMIDLY TOWARDS HER.

‚ÄÚTAKE IT. I FORGOT TO GIVE IT BACK. DON‚ÄÔT BE ANGRY WITH MY RUDENESS.‚ÄÙ

SHE TOOK FROM HER SHOULDERS THE BLACK SHAWL THAT VARVARA PETROVNA HAD WRAPPED ROUND HER.

‚ÄÚPUT IT ON AGAIN AT ONCE, AND YOU CAN KEEP IT ALWAYS. GO AND SIT DOWN, DRINK YOUR COFFEE, AND PLEASE DON‚ÄÔT BE AFRAID OF ME, MY DEAR, DON‚ÄÔT WORRY YOURSELF. I AM BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCH√®RE AMIE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH VENTURED AGAIN.

‚ÄÚACH, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, IT‚ÄÔS BEWILDERING ENOUGH WITHOUT YOU. YOU MIGHT AT LEAST SPARE ME.‚Ä¶ PLEASE RING THAT BELL THERE, NEAR YOU, TO THE MAID‚ÄÔS ROOM.‚ÄÙ

A SILENCE FOLLOWED. HER EYES STRAYED IRRITABLY AND SUSPICIOUSLY OVER ALL OUR FACES. AGASHA, HER FAVOURITE MAID, CAME IN.

‚ÄÚBRING ME MY CHECK SHAWL, THE ONE I BOUGHT IN GENEVA. WHAT‚ÄÔS DARYA PAVLOVNA DOING?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSHE‚ÄÔS NOT VERY WELL, MADAM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGO AND ASK HER TO COME HERE. SAY THAT I WANT HER PARTICULARLY, EVEN IF SHE‚ÄÔS NOT WELL.‚ÄÙ

AT THAT INSTANT THERE WAS AGAIN, AS BEFORE, AN UNUSUAL NOISE OF STEPS AND VOICES IN THE NEXT ROOM, AND SUDDENLY PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA, PANTING AND ‚ÄÚDISTRACTED,‚ÄÙ APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY. SHE WAS LEANING ON THE ARM OF MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH.

‚ÄÚACH, HEAVENS, I COULD SCARCELY DRAG MYSELF HERE. LIZA, YOU MAD GIRL, HOW YOU TREAT YOUR MOTHER!‚ÄÙ SHE SQUEAKED, CONCENTRATING IN THAT SQUEAK, AS WEAK AND IRRITABLE PEOPLE ARE WONT TO DO, ALL HER ACCUMULATED IRRITABILITY. ‚ÄÚVARVARA PETROVNA, I‚ÄÔVE COME FOR MY DAUGHTER!‚ÄÙ

VARVARA PETROVNA LOOKED AT HER FROM UNDER HER BROWS, HALF ROSE TO MEET HER, AND SCARCELY CONCEALING HER VEXATION BROUGHT OUT: ‚ÄÚGOOD MORNING, PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA, PLEASE BE SEATED, I KNEW YOU WOULD COME!‚ÄÙ

II

THERE COULD BE NOTHING SURPRISING TO PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA IN SUCH A RECEPTION. VARVARA PETROVNA HAD FROM CHILDHOOD UPWARDS TREATED HER OLD SCHOOL FRIEND TYRANNICALLY, AND UNDER A SHOW OF FRIENDSHIP ALMOST CONTEMPTUOUSLY. AND THIS WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL OCCASION TOO. DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS THERE HAD ALMOST BEEN A COMPLETE RUPTURE BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSEHOLDS, AS I HAVE MENTIONED INCIDENTALLY ALREADY. THE REASON OF THIS RUPTURE WAS STILL A MYSTERY TO VARVARA PETROVNA, WHICH MADE IT ALL THE MORE OFFENSIVE; BUT THE CHIEF CAUSE OF OFFENCE WAS THAT PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA HAD SUCCEEDED IN TAKING UP AN EXTRAORDINARILY SUPERCILIOUS ATTITUDE TOWARDS VARVARA PETROVNA. VARVARA PETROVNA WAS WOUNDED OF COURSE, AND MEANWHILE SOME STRANGE RUMOURS HAD REACHED HER WHICH ALSO IRRITATED HER EXTREMELY, ESPECIALLY BY THEIR VAGUENESS. VARVARA PETROVNA WAS OF A DIRECT AND PROUDLY FRANK CHARACTER, SOMEWHAT SLAP-DASH IN HER METHODS, INDEED, IF THE EXPRESSION IS PERMISSIBLE. THERE WAS NOTHING SHE DETESTED SO MUCH AS SECRET AND MYSTERIOUS INSINUATIONS, SHE ALWAYS PREFERRED WAR IN THE OPEN. ANYWAY, THE TWO LADIES HAD NOT MET FOR FIVE DAYS. THE LAST VISIT HAD BEEN PAID BY VARVARA PETROVNA, WHO HAD COME BACK FROM ‚ÄÚTHAT DROZDOV WOMAN‚ÄÙ OFFENDED AND PERPLEXED. I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA HAD COME ON THIS OCCASION WITH THE NA√ØVE CONVICTION THAT VARVARA PETROVNA WOULD, FOR SOME REASON, BE SURE TO STAND IN AWE OF HER. THIS WAS EVIDENT FROM THE VERY EXPRESSION OF HER FACE. EVIDENTLY TOO, VARVARA PETROVNA WAS ALWAYS POSSESSED BY A DEMON OF HAUGHTY PRIDE WHENEVER SHE HAD THE LEAST GROUND FOR SUSPECTING THAT SHE WAS FOR SOME REASON SUPPOSED TO BE HUMILIATED. LIKE MANY WEAK PEOPLE, WHO FOR A LONG TIME ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE INSULTED WITHOUT RESENTING IT, PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA SHOWED AN EXTRAORDINARY VIOLENCE IN HER ATTACK AT THE FIRST FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY. IT IS TRUE THAT SHE WAS NOT WELL, AND ALWAYS BECAME MORE IRRITABLE IN ILLNESS. I MUST ADD FINALLY, THAT OUR PRESENCE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM COULD HARDLY BE MUCH CHECK TO THE TWO LADIES WHO HAD BEEN FRIENDS FROM CHILDHOOD, IF A QUARREL HAD BROKEN OUT BETWEEN THEM. WE WERE LOOKED UPON AS FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY, AND ALMOST AS THEIR SUBJECTS. I MADE THAT REFLECTION WITH SOME ALARM AT THE TIME. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, WHO HAD NOT SAT DOWN SINCE THE ENTRANCE OF VARVARA PETROVNA, SANK HELPLESSLY INTO AN ARM-CHAIR ON HEARING PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA‚ÄÔS SQUEAL, AND TRIED TO CATCH MY EYE WITH A LOOK OF DESPAIR. SHATOV TURNED SHARPLY IN HIS CHAIR, AND GROWLED SOMETHING TO HIMSELF. I BELIEVE HE MEANT TO GET UP AND GO AWAY. LIZA ROSE FROM HER CHAIR BUT SANK BACK AGAIN AT ONCE WITHOUT EVEN PAYING BEFITTING ATTENTION TO HER MOTHER‚ÄÔS SQUEAL‚ÄÎNOT FROM ‚ÄÚWAYWARDNESS,‚ÄÙ BUT OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE SHE WAS ENTIRELY ABSORBED BY SOME OTHER OVERWHELMING IMPRESSION. SHE WAS LOOKING ABSENT-MINDEDLY INTO THE AIR, NO LONGER NOTICING EVEN MARYA TIMOFYEVNA.

III

‚ÄÚACH, HERE!‚ÄÙ PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA INDICATED AN EASY CHAIR NEAR THE TABLE AND SANK HEAVILY INTO IT WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH. ‚ÄÚI WOULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE SAT DOWN IN YOUR HOUSE, MY LADY, IF IT WEREN‚ÄÔT FOR MY LEGS,‚ÄÙ SHE ADDED IN A BREAKING VOICE.

VARVARA PETROVNA RAISED HER HEAD A LITTLE, AND WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SUFFERING PRESSED THE FINGERS OF HER RIGHT HAND TO HER RIGHT TEMPLE, EVIDENTLY IN ACUTE PAIN (TIC DOULOUREUX).

‚ÄÚWHY SO, PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA; WHY WOULDN‚ÄÔT YOU SIT DOWN IN MY HOUSE? I POSSESSED YOUR LATE HUSBAND‚ÄÔS SINCERE FRIENDSHIP ALL HIS LIFE; AND YOU AND I USED TO PLAY WITH OUR DOLLS AT SCHOOL TOGETHER AS GIRLS.‚ÄÙ

PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA WAVED HER HANDS.

‚ÄÚI KNEW THAT WAS COMING! YOU ALWAYS BEGIN ABOUT THE SCHOOL WHEN YOU WANT TO REPROACH ME‚ÄÎTHAT‚ÄÔS YOUR WAY. BUT TO MY THINKING THAT‚ÄÔS ONLY FINE TALK. I CAN‚ÄÔT STAND THE SCHOOL YOU‚ÄÔRE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE COME IN RATHER A BAD TEMPER, I‚ÄÔM AFRAID; HOW ARE YOUR LEGS? HERE THEY‚ÄÔRE BRINGING YOU SOME COFFEE, PLEASE HAVE SOME, DRINK IT AND DON‚ÄÔT BE CROSS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚVARVARA PETROVNA, YOU TREAT ME AS THOUGH I WERE A CHILD. I WON‚ÄÔT HAVE ANY COFFEE, SO THERE!‚ÄÙ

AND SHE PETTISHLY WAVED AWAY THE FOOTMAN WHO WAS BRINGING HER COFFEE. (ALL THE OTHERS REFUSED COFFEE TOO EXCEPT MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH AND ME. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH TOOK IT, BUT PUT IT ASIDE ON THE TABLE. THOUGH MARYA TIMOFYEVNA WAS VERY EAGER TO HAVE ANOTHER CUP AND EVEN PUT OUT HER HAND TO TAKE IT, ON SECOND THOUGHTS SHE REFUSED IT CEREMONIOUSLY, AND WAS OBVIOUSLY PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR DOING SO.)

VARVARA PETROVNA GAVE A WRY SMILE.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS, PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA, MY FRIEND, YOU MUST HAVE TAKEN SOME FANCY INTO YOUR HEAD AGAIN, AND THAT‚ÄÔS WHY YOU‚ÄÔVE COME. YOU‚ÄÔVE SIMPLY LIVED ON FANCIES ALL YOUR LIFE. YOU FLEW INTO A FURY AT THE MERE MENTION OF OUR SCHOOL; BUT DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU CAME AND PERSUADED ALL THE CLASS THAT A HUSSAR CALLED SHABLYKIN HAD PROPOSED TO YOU, AND HOW MME. LEFEBURE PROVED ON THE SPOT YOU WERE LYING. YET YOU WEREN‚ÄÔT LYING, YOU WERE SIMPLY IMAGINING IT ALL TO AMUSE YOURSELF. COME, TELL ME, WHAT IS IT NOW? WHAT ARE YOU FANCYING NOW; WHAT IS IT VEXES YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH THE PRIEST WHO USED TO TEACH US SCRIPTURE AT SCHOOL‚ÄÎSO MUCH FOR YOU, SINCE YOU‚ÄÔVE SUCH A SPITEFUL MEMORY. HA HA HA!‚ÄÙ

SHE LAUGHED VICIOUSLY AND WENT OFF INTO A FIT OF COUGHING.

‚ÄÚAH, YOU‚ÄÔVE NOT FORGOTTEN THE PRIEST THEN ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ SAID VARVARA PETROVNA, LOOKING AT HER VINDICTIVELY.

HER FACE TURNED GREEN. PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA SUDDENLY ASSUMED A DIGNIFIED AIR.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM IN NO LAUGHING MOOD NOW, MADAM. WHY HAVE YOU DRAWN MY DAUGHTER INTO YOUR SCANDALS IN THE FACE OF THE WHOLE TOWN? THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT I‚ÄÔVE COME ABOUT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMY SCANDALS?‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA DREW HERSELF UP MENACINGLY.

‚ÄÚMAMAN, I ENTREAT YOU TOO, TO RESTRAIN YOURSELF,‚ÄÙ LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA BROUGHT OUT SUDDENLY.

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THAT YOU SAY?‚ÄÙ THE MAMAN WAS ON THE POINT OF BREAKING INTO A SQUEAL AGAIN, BUT CATCHING HER DAUGHTER‚ÄÔS FLASHING EYE, SHE SUBSIDED SUDDENLY.

‚ÄÚHOW COULD YOU TALK ABOUT SCANDAL, MAMAN?‚ÄÙ CRIED LIZA, FLUSHING RED. ‚ÄÚI CAME OF MY OWN ACCORD WITH YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS PERMISSION, BECAUSE I WANTED TO LEARN THIS UNHAPPY WOMAN‚ÄÔS STORY AND TO BE OF USE TO HER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHIS UNHAPPY WOMAN‚ÄÔS STORY!‚ÄÙ PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA DRAWLED WITH A SPITEFUL LAUGH. ‚ÄÚIS IT YOUR PLACE TO MIX YOURSELF UP WITH SUCH ‚ÄÒSTORIES.‚ÄÔ ACH, ENOUGH OF YOUR TYRANNISING!‚ÄÙ SHE TURNED FURIOUSLY TO VARVARA PETROVNA. ‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHETHER IT‚ÄÔS TRUE OR NOT, THEY SAY YOU KEEP THE WHOLE TOWN IN ORDER, BUT IT SEEMS YOUR TURN HAS COME AT LAST.‚ÄÙ

VARVARA PETROVNA SAT STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW READY TO FLY FROM THE BOW. FOR TEN SECONDS SHE LOOKED STERNLY AND IMMOVABLY AT PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA.

‚ÄÚWELL, PRASKOVYA, YOU MUST THANK GOD THAT ALL HERE PRESENT ARE OUR FRIENDS,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID AT LAST WITH OMINOUS COMPOSURE. ‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE SAID A GREAT DEAL BETTER UNSAID.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT I‚ÄÔM NOT SO MUCH AFRAID OF WHAT THE WORLD WILL SAY, MY LADY, AS SOME PEOPLE. IT‚ÄÔS YOU WHO, UNDER A SHOW OF PRIDE, ARE TREMBLING AT WHAT PEOPLE WILL SAY. AND AS FOR ALL HERE BEING YOUR FRIENDS, IT‚ÄÔS BETTER FOR YOU THAN IF STRANGERS HAD BEEN LISTENING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHAVE YOU GROWN WISER DURING THIS LAST WEEK?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS NOT THAT I‚ÄÔVE GROWN WISER, BUT SIMPLY THAT THE TRUTH HAS COME OUT THIS WEEK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT TRUTH HAS COME OUT THIS WEEK? LISTEN, PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA, DON‚ÄÔT IRRITATE ME. EXPLAIN TO ME THIS MINUTE, I BEG YOU AS A FAVOUR, WHAT TRUTH HAS COME OUT AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY THERE IT IS, SITTING BEFORE YOU!‚ÄÙ AND PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA SUDDENLY POINTED AT MARYA TIMOFYEVNA WITH THAT DESPERATE DETERMINATION WHICH TAKES NO HEED OF CONSEQUENCES, IF ONLY IT CAN MAKE AN IMPRESSION AT THE MOMENT. MARYA TIMOFYEVNA, WHO HAD WATCHED HER ALL THE TIME WITH LIGHT-HEARTED CURIOSITY, LAUGHED EXULTINGLY AT THE SIGHT OF THE WRATHFUL GUEST‚ÄÔS FINGER POINTED IMPETUOUSLY AT HER, AND WRIGGLED GLEEFULLY IN HER EASY CHAIR.

‚ÄÚGOD ALMIGHTY HAVE MERCY ON US, THEY‚ÄÔVE ALL GONE CRAZY!‚ÄÙ EXCLAIMED VARVARA PETROVNA, AND TURNING PALE SHE SANK BACK IN HER CHAIR.

SHE TURNED SO PALE THAT IT CAUSED SOME COMMOTION. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS THE FIRST TO RUSH UP TO HER. I DREW NEAR ALSO; EVEN LIZA GOT UP FROM HER SEAT, THOUGH SHE DID NOT COME FORWARD. BUT THE MOST ALARMED OF ALL WAS PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA HERSELF. SHE UTTERED A SCREAM, GOT UP AS FAR AS SHE COULD AND ALMOST WAILED IN A LACHRYMOSE VOICE:

‚ÄÚVARVARA PETROVNA, DEAR, FORGIVE ME FOR MY WICKED FOOLISHNESS! GIVE HER SOME WATER, SOMEBODY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT WHIMPER, PLEASE, PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA, AND LEAVE ME ALONE, GENTLEMEN, PLEASE, I DON‚ÄÔT WANT ANY WATER!‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA PRONOUNCED IN A FIRM THOUGH LOW VOICE, WITH BLANCHED LIPS.

‚ÄÚVARVARA PETROVNA, MY DEAR,‚ÄÙ PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA WENT ON, A LITTLE REASSURED, ‚ÄÚTHOUGH I AM TO BLAME FOR MY RECKLESS WORDS, WHAT‚ÄÔS UPSET ME MORE THAN ANYTHING ARE THESE ANONYMOUS LETTERS THAT SOME LOW CREATURES KEEP BOMBARDING ME WITH; THEY MIGHT WRITE TO YOU, SINCE IT CONCERNS YOU, BUT I‚ÄÔVE A DAUGHTER!‚ÄÙ

VARVARA PETROVNA LOOKED AT HER IN SILENCE, WITH WIDE-OPEN EYES, LISTENING WITH WONDER. AT THAT MOMENT A SIDE-DOOR IN THE CORNER OPENED NOISELESSLY, AND DARYA PAVLOVNA MADE HER APPEARANCE. SHE STOOD STILL AND LOOKED ROUND. SHE WAS STRUCK BY OUR PERTURBATION. PROBABLY SHE DID NOT AT FIRST DISTINGUISH MARYA TIMOFYEVNA, OF WHOSE PRESENCE SHE HAD NOT BEEN INFORMED. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS THE FIRST TO NOTICE HER; HE MADE A RAPID MOVEMENT, TURNED RED, AND FOR SOME REASON PROCLAIMED IN A LOUD VOICE: ‚ÄÚDARYA PAVLOVNA!‚ÄÙ SO THAT ALL EYES TURNED ON THE NEW-COMER.

‚ÄÚOH, IS THIS YOUR DARYA PAVLOVNA!‚ÄÙ CRIED MARYA TIMOFYEVNA. ‚ÄÚWELL, SHATUSHKA, YOUR SISTER‚ÄÔS NOT LIKE YOU. HOW CAN MY FELLOW CALL SUCH A CHARMER THE SERF-WENCH DASHA?‚ÄÙ

MEANWHILE DARYA PAVLOVNA HAD GONE UP TO VARVARA PETROVNA, BUT STRUCK BY MARYA TIMOFYEVNA‚ÄÔS EXCLAMATION SHE TURNED QUICKLY AND STOPPED JUST BEFORE HER CHAIR, LOOKING AT THE IMBECILE WITH A LONG FIXED GAZE.

‚ÄÚSIT DOWN, DASHA,‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA BROUGHT OUT WITH TERRIFYING COMPOSURE. ‚ÄÚNEARER, THAT‚ÄÔS RIGHT. YOU CAN SEE THIS WOMAN, SITTING DOWN. DO YOU KNOW HER?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI HAVE NEVER SEEN HER,‚ÄÙ DASHA ANSWERED QUIETLY, AND AFTER A PAUSE SHE ADDED AT ONCE:

‚ÄÚSHE MUST BE THE INVALID SISTER OF CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND IT‚ÄÔS THE FIRST TIME I‚ÄÔVE SET EYES ON YOU, MY LOVE, THOUGH I‚ÄÔVE BEEN INTERESTED AND WANTED TO KNOW YOU A LONG TIME, FOR I SEE HOW WELL-BRED YOU ARE IN EVERY MOVEMENT YOU MAKE,‚ÄÙ MARYA TIMOFYEVNA CRIED ENTHUSIASTICALLY. ‚ÄÚAND THOUGH MY FOOTMAN SWEARS AT YOU, CAN SUCH A WELL-EDUCATED CHARMING PERSON AS YOU REALLY HAVE STOLEN MONEY FROM HIM? FOR YOU ARE SWEET, SWEET, SWEET, I TELL YOU THAT FROM MYSELF!‚ÄÙ SHE CONCLUDED, ENTHUSIASTICALLY WAVING HER HAND.

‚ÄÚCAN YOU MAKE ANYTHING OF IT?‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA ASKED WITH PROUD DIGNITY.

‚ÄÚI UNDERSTAND IT.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE MONEY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO DOUBT IT‚ÄÔS THE MONEY THAT I UNDERTOOK AT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH‚ÄÔS REQUEST TO HAND OVER TO HER BROTHER, CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN.‚ÄÙ

A SILENCE FOLLOWED.

‚ÄÚDID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HIMSELF ASK YOU TO DO SO?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO SEND THAT MONEY, THREE HUNDRED ROUBLES, TO MR. LEBYADKIN. AND AS HE DIDN‚ÄÔT KNOW HIS ADDRESS, BUT ONLY KNEW THAT HE WAS TO BE IN OUR TOWN, HE CHARGED ME TO GIVE IT TO MR. LEBYADKIN IF HE CAME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT IS THE MONEY ‚Ä¶ LOST? WHAT WAS THIS WOMAN SPEAKING ABOUT JUST NOW?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW. I‚ÄÔVE HEARD BEFORE THAT MR. LEBYADKIN SAYS I DIDN‚ÄÔT GIVE HIM ALL THE MONEY, BUT I DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND HIS WORDS. THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED ROUBLES AND I SENT HIM THREE HUNDRED ROUBLES.‚ÄÙ

DARYA PAVLOVNA HAD ALMOST COMPLETELY REGAINED HER COMPOSURE. AND IT WAS DIFFICULT, I MAY MENTION, AS A RULE, TO ASTONISH THE GIRL OR RUFFLE HER CALM FOR LONG‚ÄÎWHATEVER SHE MIGHT BE FEELING. SHE BROUGHT OUT ALL HER ANSWERS NOW WITHOUT HASTE, REPLIED IMMEDIATELY TO EVERY QUESTION WITH ACCURACY, QUIETLY, SMOOTHLY, AND WITHOUT A TRACE OF THE SUDDEN EMOTION SHE HAD SHOWN AT FIRST, OR THE SLIGHTEST EMBARRASSMENT WHICH MIGHT HAVE SUGGESTED A CONSCIOUSNESS OF GUILT. VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS EYES WERE FASTENED UPON HER ALL THE TIME SHE WAS SPEAKING. VARVARA PETROVNA THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE:

‚ÄÚIF,‚ÄÙ SHE PRONOUNCED AT LAST FIRMLY, EVIDENTLY ADDRESSING ALL PRESENT, THOUGH SHE ONLY LOOKED AT DASHA, ‚ÄÚIF NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH DID NOT APPEAL EVEN TO ME BUT ASKED YOU TO DO THIS FOR HIM, HE MUST HAVE HAD HIS REASONS FOR DOING SO. I DON‚ÄÔT CONSIDER I HAVE ANY RIGHT TO INQUIRE INTO THEM, IF THEY ARE KEPT SECRET FROM ME. BUT THE VERY FACT OF YOUR HAVING TAKEN PART IN THE MATTER REASSURES ME ON THAT SCORE, BE SURE OF THAT, DARYA, IN ANY CASE. BUT YOU SEE, MY DEAR, YOU MAY, THROUGH IGNORANCE OF THE WORLD, HAVE QUITE INNOCENTLY DONE SOMETHING IMPRUDENT; AND YOU DID SO WHEN YOU UNDERTOOK TO HAVE DEALINGS WITH A LOW CHARACTER. THE RUMOURS SPREAD BY THIS RASCAL SHOW WHAT A MISTAKE YOU MADE. BUT I WILL FIND OUT ABOUT HIM, AND AS IT IS MY TASK TO PROTECT YOU, I SHALL KNOW HOW TO DEFEND YOU. BUT NOW ALL THIS MUST BE PUT A STOP TO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE BEST THING TO DO,‚ÄÙ SAID MARYA TIMOFYEVNA, POPPING UP FROM HER CHAIR, ‚ÄÚIS TO SEND HIM TO THE FOOTMEN‚ÄÔS ROOM WHEN HE COMES. LET HIM SIT ON THE BENCHES THERE AND PLAY CARDS WITH THEM WHILE WE SIT HERE AND DRINK COFFEE. WE MIGHT SEND HIM A CUP OF COFFEE TOO, BUT I HAVE A GREAT CONTEMPT FOR HIM.‚ÄÙ

AND SHE WAGGED HER HEAD EXPRESSIVELY.

‚ÄÚWE MUST PUT A STOP TO THIS,‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA REPEATED, LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO MARYA TIMOFYEVNA. ‚ÄÚRING, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, I BEG YOU.‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH RANG, AND SUDDENLY STEPPED FORWARD, ALL EXCITEMENT.

‚ÄÚIF ‚Ä¶ IF ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HE FALTERED FEVERISHLY, FLUSHING, BREAKING OFF AND STUTTERING, ‚ÄÚIF I TOO HAVE HEARD THE MOST REVOLTING STORY, OR RATHER SLANDER, IT WAS WITH UTTER INDIGNATION ‚Ä¶ ENFIN C‚ÄÔEST UN HOMME PERDU, ET QUELQUE CHOSE COMME UN FOR√ßAT EVAD√©.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

HE BROKE DOWN AND COULD NOT GO ON. VARVARA PETROVNA, SCREWING UP HER EYES, LOOKED HIM UP AND DOWN.

THE CEREMONIOUS BUTLER ALEXEY YEGORYTCH CAME IN.

‚ÄÚTHE CARRIAGE,‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA ORDERED. ‚ÄÚAND YOU, ALEXEY YEGORYTCH, GET READY TO ESCORT MISS LEBYADKIN HOME; SHE WILL GIVE YOU THE ADDRESS HERSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMR. LEBYADKIN HAS BEEN WAITING FOR HER FOR SOME TIME DOWNSTAIRS, AND HAS BEEN BEGGING ME TO ANNOUNCE HIM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS IMPOSSIBLE, VARVARA PETROVNA!‚ÄÙ AND MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, WHO HAD SAT ALL THE TIME IN UNBROKEN SILENCE, SUDDENLY CAME FORWARD IN ALARM. ‚ÄÚIF I MAY SPEAK, HE IS NOT A MAN WHO CAN BE ADMITTED INTO SOCIETY. HE ‚Ä¶ HE ‚Ä¶ HE‚ÄÔS AN IMPOSSIBLE PERSON, VARVARA PETROVNA!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWAIT A MOMENT,‚ÄÙ SAID VARVARA PETROVNA TO ALEXEY YEGORYTCH, AND HE DISAPPEARED AT ONCE.

‚ÄÚC‚ÄÔEST UN HOMME MALHONN√™TE ET JE CROIS M√™ME QUE C‚ÄÔEST UN FOR√ßAT EVAD√© OU QUELQUE CHOSE DANS CE GENRE,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH MUTTERED AGAIN, AND AGAIN HE FLUSHED RED AND BROKE OFF.

‚ÄÚLIZA, IT‚ÄÔS TIME WE WERE GOING,‚ÄÙ ANNOUNCED PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA DISDAINFULLY, GETTING UP FROM HER SEAT. SHE SEEMED SORRY THAT IN HER ALARM SHE HAD CALLED HERSELF A FOOL. WHILE DARYA PAVLOVNA WAS SPEAKING, SHE LISTENED, PRESSING HER LIPS SUPERCILIOUSLY. BUT WHAT STRUCK ME MOST WAS THE EXPRESSION OF LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA FROM THE MOMENT DARYA PAVLOVNA HAD COME IN. THERE WAS A GLEAM OF HATRED AND HARDLY DISGUISED CONTEMPT IN HER EYES.

‚ÄÚWAIT ONE MINUTE, PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA, I BEG YOU.‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA DETAINED HER, STILL WITH THE SAME EXAGGERATED COMPOSURE. ‚ÄÚKINDLY SIT DOWN. I INTEND TO SPEAK OUT, AND YOUR LEGS ARE BAD. THAT‚ÄÔS RIGHT, THANK YOU. I LOST MY TEMPER JUST NOW AND UTTERED SOME IMPATIENT WORDS. BE SO GOOD AS TO FORGIVE ME. I BEHAVED FOOLISHLY AND I‚ÄÔM THE FIRST TO REGRET IT, BECAUSE I LIKE FAIRNESS IN EVERYTHING. LOSING YOUR TEMPER TOO, OF COURSE, YOU SPOKE OF CERTAIN ANONYMOUS LETTERS. EVERY ANONYMOUS COMMUNICATION IS DESERVING OF CONTEMPT, JUST BECAUSE IT‚ÄÔS NOT SIGNED. IF YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY I‚ÄÔM SORRY FOR YOU. IN ANY CASE, IF I WERE IN YOUR PLACE, I WOULD NOT PRY INTO SUCH DIRTY CORNERS, I WOULD NOT SOIL MY HANDS WITH IT. BUT YOU HAVE SOILED YOURS. HOWEVER, SINCE YOU HAVE BEGUN ON THE SUBJECT YOURSELF, I MUST TELL YOU THAT SIX DAYS AGO I TOO RECEIVED A CLOWNISH ANONYMOUS LETTER. IN IT SOME RASCAL INFORMS ME THAT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAS GONE OUT OF HIS MIND, AND THAT I HAVE REASON TO FEAR SOME LAME WOMAN, WHO ‚ÄÒIS DESTINED TO PLAY A GREAT PART IN MY LIFE.‚ÄÔ I REMEMBER THE EXPRESSION. REFLECTING AND BEING AWARE THAT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAS VERY NUMEROUS ENEMIES, I PROMPTLY SENT FOR A MAN LIVING HERE, ONE OF HIS SECRET ENEMIES, AND THE MOST VINDICTIVE AND CONTEMPTIBLE OF THEM, AND FROM MY CONVERSATION WITH HIM I GATHERED WHAT WAS THE DESPICABLE SOURCE OF THE ANONYMOUS LETTER. IF YOU TOO, MY POOR PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA, HAVE BEEN WORRIED BY SIMILAR LETTERS ON MY ACCOUNT, AND AS YOU SAY ‚ÄÒBOMBARDED‚ÄÔ WITH THEM, I AM, OF COURSE, THE FIRST TO REGRET HAVING BEEN THE INNOCENT CAUSE OF IT. THAT‚ÄÔS ALL I WANTED TO TELL YOU BY WAY OF EXPLANATION. I‚ÄÔM VERY SORRY TO SEE THAT YOU ARE SO TIRED AND SO UPSET. BESIDES, I HAVE QUITE MADE UP MY MIND TO SEE THAT SUSPICIOUS PERSONAGE OF WHOM MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH SAID JUST NOW, A LITTLE INAPPROPRIATELY, THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RECEIVE HIM. LIZA IN PARTICULAR NEED HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. COME TO ME, LIZA, MY DEAR, LET ME KISS YOU AGAIN.‚ÄÙ

LIZA CROSSED THE ROOM AND STOOD IN SILENCE BEFORE VARVARA PETROVNA. THE LATTER KISSED HER, TOOK HER HANDS, AND, HOLDING HER AT ARM‚ÄÔS-LENGTH, LOOKED AT HER WITH FEELING, THEN MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER HER AND KISSED HER AGAIN.

‚ÄÚWELL, GOOD-BYE, LIZA‚ÄÙ (THERE WAS ALMOST THE SOUND OF TEARS IN VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS VOICE), ‚ÄÚBELIEVE THAT I SHALL NEVER CEASE TO LOVE YOU WHATEVER FATE HAS IN STORE FOR YOU. GOD BE WITH YOU. I HAVE ALWAYS BLESSED HIS HOLY WILL.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

SHE WOULD HAVE ADDED SOMETHING MORE, BUT RESTRAINED HERSELF AND BROKE OFF. LIZA WAS WALKING BACK TO HER PLACE, STILL IN THE SAME SILENCE, AS IT WERE PLUNGED IN THOUGHT, BUT SHE SUDDENLY STOPPED BEFORE HER MOTHER.

‚ÄÚI AM NOT GOING YET, MOTHER. I‚ÄÔLL STAY A LITTLE LONGER AT AUNTIE‚ÄÔS,‚ÄÙ SHE BROUGHT OUT IN A LOW VOICE, BUT THERE WAS A NOTE OF IRON DETERMINATION IN THOSE QUIET WORDS.

‚ÄÚMY GOODNESS! WHAT NOW?‚ÄÙ WAILED PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA, CLASPING HER HANDS HELPLESSLY. BUT LIZA DID NOT ANSWER, AND SEEMED INDEED NOT TO HEAR HER; SHE SAT DOWN IN THE SAME CORNER AND FELL TO GAZING INTO SPACE AGAIN AS BEFORE.

THERE WAS A LOOK OF PRIDE AND TRIUMPH IN VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS FACE.

‚ÄÚMAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, I HAVE A GREAT FAVOUR TO ASK OF YOU. BE SO KIND AS TO GO AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT PERSON DOWNSTAIRS, AND IF THERE IS ANY POSSIBILITY OF ADMITTING HIM, BRING HIM UP HERE.‚ÄÙ

MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH BOWED AND WENT OUT. A MOMENT LATER HE BROUGHT IN MR. LEBYADKIN.

IV

I HAVE SAID SOMETHING OF THIS GENTLEMAN‚ÄÔS OUTWARD APPEARANCE. HE WAS A TALL, CURLY-HAIRED, THICK-SET FELLOW ABOUT FORTY WITH A PURPLISH, RATHER BLOATED AND FLABBY FACE, WITH CHEEKS THAT QUIVERED AT EVERY MOVEMENT OF HIS HEAD, WITH LITTLE BLOODSHOT EYES THAT WERE SOMETIMES RATHER CRAFTY, WITH MOUSTACHES AND SIDE-WHISKERS, AND WITH AN INCIPIENT DOUBLE CHIN, FLESHY AND RATHER UNPLEASANT-LOOKING. BUT WHAT WAS MOST STRIKING ABOUT HIM WAS THE FACT THAT HE APPEARED NOW WEARING A DRESS-COAT AND CLEAN LINEN.

‚ÄÚTHERE ARE PEOPLE ON WHOM CLEAN LINEN IS ALMOST UNSEEMLY,‚ÄÙ AS LIPUTIN HAD ONCE SAID WHEN STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH REPROACHED HIM IN JEST FOR BEING UNTIDY. THE CAPTAIN HAD PERFECTLY NEW BLACK GLOVES TOO, OF WHICH HE HELD THE RIGHT ONE IN HIS HAND, WHILE THE LEFT, TIGHTLY STRETCHED AND UNBUTTONED, COVERED PART OF THE HUGE FLESHY FIST IN WHICH HE HELD A BRAND-NEW, GLOSSY ROUND HAT, PROBABLY WORN FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY. IT APPEARED THEREFORE THAT ‚ÄÚTHE GARB OF LOVE,‚ÄÙ OF WHICH HE HAD SHOUTED TO SHATOV THE DAY BEFORE, REALLY DID EXIST. ALL THIS, THAT IS, THE DRESS-COAT AND CLEAN LINEN, HAD BEEN PROCURED BY LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS ADVICE WITH SOME MYSTERIOUS OBJECT IN VIEW (AS I FOUND OUT LATER). THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT HIS COMING NOW (IN A HIRED CARRIAGE) WAS AT THE INSTIGATION AND WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF SOMEONE ELSE; IT WOULD NEVER HAVE DAWNED ON HIM, NOR COULD HE BY HIMSELF HAVE SUCCEEDED IN DRESSING, GETTING READY AND MAKING UP HIS MIND IN THREE-QUARTERS OF AN HOUR, EVEN IF THE SCENE IN THE PORCH OF THE CATHEDRAL HAD REACHED HIS EARS AT ONCE. HE WAS NOT DRUNK, BUT WAS IN THE DULL, HEAVY, DAZED CONDITION OF A MAN SUDDENLY AWAKENED AFTER MANY DAYS OF DRINKING. IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HE WOULD BE DRUNK AGAIN IF ONE WERE TO PUT ONE‚ÄÔS HANDS ON HIS SHOULDERS AND ROCK HIM TO AND FRO ONCE OR TWICE. HE WAS HURRYING INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM BUT STUMBLED OVER A RUG NEAR THE DOORWAY. MARYA TIMOFYEVNA WAS HELPLESS WITH LAUGHTER. HE LOOKED SAVAGELY AT HER AND SUDDENLY TOOK A FEW RAPID STEPS TOWARDS VARVARA PETROVNA.

‚ÄÚI HAVE COME, MADAM ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HE BLARED OUT LIKE A TRUMPET-BLAST.

‚ÄÚBE SO GOOD, SIR, AS TO TAKE A SEAT THERE, ON THAT CHAIR,‚ÄÙ SAID VARVARA PETROVNA, DRAWING HERSELF UP. ‚ÄÚI SHALL HEAR YOU AS WELL FROM THERE, AND IT WILL BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR ME TO LOOK AT YOU FROM HERE.‚ÄÙ

THE CAPTAIN STOPPED SHORT, LOOKING BLANKLY BEFORE HIM. HE TURNED, HOWEVER, AND SAT DOWN ON THE SEAT INDICATED CLOSE TO THE DOOR. AN EXTREME LACK OF SELF-CONFIDENCE AND AT THE SAME TIME INSOLENCE, AND A SORT OF INCESSANT IRRITABILITY, WERE APPARENT IN THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE. HE WAS HORRIBLY SCARED, THAT WAS EVIDENT, BUT HIS SELF-CONCEIT WAS WOUNDED, AND IT MIGHT BE SURMISED THAT HIS MORTIFIED VANITY MIGHT ON OCCASION LEAD HIM TO ANY EFFRONTERY, IN SPITE OF HIS COWARDICE. HE WAS EVIDENTLY UNEASY AT EVERY MOVEMENT OF HIS CLUMSY PERSON. WE ALL KNOW THAT WHEN SUCH GENTLEMEN ARE BROUGHT BY SOME MARVELLOUS CHANCE INTO SOCIETY, THEY FIND THEIR WORST ORDEAL IN THEIR OWN HANDS, AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF DISPOSING THEM BECOMINGLY, OF WHICH THEY ARE CONSCIOUS AT EVERY MOMENT. THE CAPTAIN SAT RIGID IN HIS CHAIR, WITH HIS HAT AND GLOVES IN HIS HANDS AND HIS EYES FIXED WITH A SENSELESS STARE ON THE STERN FACE OF VARVARA PETROVNA. HE WOULD HAVE LIKED, PERHAPS, TO HAVE LOOKED ABOUT MORE FREELY, BUT HE COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO DO SO YET. MARYA TIMOFYEVNA, APPARENTLY THINKING HIS APPEARANCE VERY FUNNY, LAUGHED AGAIN, BUT HE DID NOT STIR. VARVARA PETROVNA RUTHLESSLY KEPT HIM IN THIS POSITION FOR A LONG TIME, A WHOLE MINUTE, STARING AT HIM WITHOUT MERCY.

‚ÄÚIN THE FIRST PLACE ALLOW ME TO LEARN YOUR NAME FROM YOURSELF,‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA PRONOUNCED IN MEASURED AND IMPRESSIVE TONES.

‚ÄÚCAPTAIN LEBYADKIN,‚ÄÙ THUNDERED THE CAPTAIN. ‚ÄÚI HAVE COME, MADAM ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HE MADE A MOVEMENT AGAIN.

‚ÄÚALLOW ME!‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA CHECKED HIM AGAIN. ‚ÄÚIS THIS UNFORTUNATE PERSON WHO INTERESTS ME SO MUCH REALLY YOUR SISTER?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMY SISTER, MADAM, WHO HAS ESCAPED FROM CONTROL, FOR SHE IS IN A CERTAIN CONDITION.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

HE SUDDENLY FALTERED AND TURNED CRIMSON. ‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT MISUNDERSTAND ME, MADAM,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, TERRIBLY CONFUSED. ‚ÄÚHER OWN BROTHER‚ÄÔS NOT GOING TO THROW MUD AT HER ‚Ä¶ IN A CERTAIN CONDITION DOESN‚ÄÔT MEAN IN SUCH A CONDITION ‚Ä¶ IN THE SENSE OF AN INJURED REPUTATION ‚Ä¶ IN THE LAST STAGE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HE SUDDENLY BROKE OFF.

‚ÄÚSIR!‚ÄÙ SAID VARVARA PETROVNA, RAISING HER HEAD.

‚ÄÚIN THIS CONDITION!‚ÄÙ HE CONCLUDED SUDDENLY, TAPPING THE MIDDLE OF HIS FOREHEAD WITH HIS FINGER.

A PAUSE FOLLOWED.

‚ÄÚAND HAS SHE SUFFERED IN THIS WAY FOR LONG?‚ÄÙ ASKED VARVARA PETROVNA, WITH A SLIGHT DRAWL.

‚ÄÚMADAM, I HAVE COME TO THANK YOU FOR THE GENEROSITY YOU SHOWED IN THE PORCH, IN A RUSSIAN, BROTHERLY WAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBROTHERLY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI MEAN, NOT BROTHERLY, BUT SIMPLY IN THE SENSE THAT I AM MY SISTER‚ÄÔS BROTHER; AND BELIEVE ME, MADAM,‚ÄÙ HE WENT ON MORE HURRIEDLY, TURNING CRIMSON AGAIN, ‚ÄÚI AM NOT SO UNEDUCATED AS I MAY APPEAR AT FIRST SIGHT IN YOUR DRAWING-ROOM. MY SISTER AND I ARE NOTHING, MADAM, COMPARED WITH THE LUXURY WE OBSERVE HERE. HAVING ENEMIES WHO SLANDER US, BESIDES. BUT ON THE QUESTION OF REPUTATION LEBYADKIN IS PROUD, MADAM ‚Ä¶ AND ‚Ä¶ AND ‚Ä¶ AND I‚ÄÔVE COME TO REPAY WITH THANKS.‚Ä¶ HERE IS MONEY, MADAM!‚ÄÙ

AT THIS POINT HE PULLED OUT A POCKET-BOOK, DREW OUT OF IT A BUNDLE OF NOTES, AND BEGAN TURNING THEM OVER WITH TREMBLING FINGERS IN A PERFECT FURY OF IMPATIENCE. IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS IN HASTE TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING, AND INDEED IT WAS QUITE NECESSARY TO DO SO. BUT PROBABLY FEELING HIMSELF THAT HIS FLUSTER WITH THE MONEY MADE HIM LOOK EVEN MORE FOOLISH, HE LOST THE LAST TRACES OF SELF-POSSESSION. THE MONEY REFUSED TO BE COUNTED. HIS FINGERS FUMBLED HELPLESSLY, AND TO COMPLETE HIS SHAME A GREEN NOTE ESCAPED FROM THE POCKET-BOOK, AND FLUTTERED IN ZIGZAGS ON TO THE CARPET.

‚ÄÚTWENTY ROUBLES, MADAM.‚ÄÙ HE LEAPT UP SUDDENLY WITH THE ROLL OF NOTES IN HIS HAND, HIS FACE PERSPIRING WITH DISCOMFORT. NOTICING THE NOTE WHICH HAD DROPPED ON THE FLOOR, HE WAS BENDING DOWN TO PICK IT UP, BUT FOR SOME REASON OVERCOME BY SHAME, HE DISMISSED IT WITH A WAVE.

‚ÄÚFOR YOUR SERVANTS, MADAM; FOR THE FOOTMAN WHO PICKS IT UP. LET THEM REMEMBER MY SISTER!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI CANNOT ALLOW THAT,‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA BROUGHT OUT HURRIEDLY, EVEN WITH SOME ALARM.

‚ÄÚIN THAT CASE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

HE BENT DOWN, PICKED IT UP, FLUSHING CRIMSON, AND SUDDENLY GOING UP TO VARVARA PETROVNA HELD OUT THE NOTES HE HAD COUNTED.

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THIS?‚ÄÙ SHE CRIED, REALLY ALARMED AT LAST, AND POSITIVELY SHRINKING BACK IN HER CHAIR.

MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, AND I ALL STEPPED FORWARD.

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT BE ALARMED, DON‚ÄÔT BE ALARMED; I‚ÄÔM NOT MAD, BY GOD, I‚ÄÔM NOT MAD,‚ÄÙ THE CAPTAIN KEPT ASSEVERATING EXCITEDLY.

‚ÄÚYES, SIR, YOU‚ÄÔRE OUT OF YOUR SENSES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMADAM, SHE‚ÄÔS NOT AT ALL AS YOU SUPPOSE. I AM AN INSIGNIFICANT LINK. OH, MADAM, WEALTHY ARE YOUR MANSIONS, BUT POOR IS THE DWELLING OF MARYA ANONYMA, MY SISTER, WHOSE MAIDEN NAME WAS LEBYADKIN, BUT WHOM WE‚ÄÔLL CALL ANONYMA FOR THE TIME, ONLY FOR THE TIME, MADAM, FOR GOD HIMSELF WILL NOT SUFFER IT FOREVER. MADAM, YOU GAVE HER TEN ROUBLES AND SHE TOOK IT, BECAUSE IT WAS FROM YOU, MADAM! DO YOU HEAR, MADAM? FROM NO ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD WOULD THIS MARYA ANONYMA TAKE IT, OR HER GRANDFATHER, THE OFFICER KILLED IN THE CAUCASUS BEFORE THE VERY EYES OF YERMOLOV, WOULD TURN IN HIS GRAVE. BUT FROM YOU, MADAM, FROM YOU SHE WILL TAKE ANYTHING. BUT WITH ONE HAND SHE TAKES IT, AND WITH THE OTHER SHE HOLDS OUT TO YOU TWENTY ROUBLES BY WAY OF SUBSCRIPTION TO ONE OF THE BENEVOLENT COMMITTEES IN PETERSBURG AND MOSCOW, OF WHICH YOU ARE A MEMBER ‚Ä¶ FOR YOU PUBLISHED YOURSELF, MADAM, IN THE MOSCOW NEWS, THAT YOU ARE READY TO RECEIVE SUBSCRIPTIONS IN OUR TOWN, AND THAT ANY ONE MAY SUBSCRIBE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

THE CAPTAIN SUDDENLY BROKE OFF; HE BREATHED HARD AS THOUGH AFTER SOME DIFFICULT ACHIEVEMENT. ALL HE SAID ABOUT THE BENEVOLENT SOCIETY HAD PROBABLY BEEN PREPARED BEFOREHAND, PERHAPS UNDER LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS SUPERVISION. HE PERSPIRED MORE THAN EVER; DROPS LITERALLY TRICKLED DOWN HIS TEMPLES. VARVARA PETROVNA LOOKED SEARCHINGLY AT HIM.

‚ÄÚTHE SUBSCRIPTION LIST,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID SEVERELY, ‚ÄÚIS ALWAYS DOWNSTAIRS IN CHARGE OF MY PORTER. THERE YOU CAN ENTER YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS IF YOU WISH TO. AND SO I BEG YOU TO PUT YOUR NOTES AWAY AND NOT TO WAVE THEM IN THE AIR. THAT‚ÄÔS RIGHT. I BEG YOU ALSO TO GO BACK TO YOUR SEAT. THAT‚ÄÔS RIGHT. I AM VERY SORRY, SIR, THAT I MADE A MISTAKE ABOUT YOUR SISTER, AND GAVE HER SOMETHING AS THOUGH SHE WERE POOR WHEN SHE IS SO RICH. THERE‚ÄÔS ONLY ONE THING I DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND, WHY SHE CAN ONLY TAKE FROM ME, AND NO ONE ELSE. YOU SO INSISTED UPON THAT THAT I SHOULD LIKE A FULL EXPLANATION.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMADAM, THAT IS A SECRET THAT MAY BE BURIED ONLY IN THE GRAVE!‚ÄÙ ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN.

‚ÄÚWHY?‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA ASKED, NOT QUITE SO FIRMLY.

‚ÄÚMADAM, MADAM ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

HE RELAPSED INTO GLOOMY SILENCE, LOOKING ON THE FLOOR, LAYING HIS RIGHT HAND ON HIS HEART. VARVARA PETROVNA WAITED, NOT TAKING HER EYES OFF HIM.

‚ÄÚMADAM!‚ÄÙ HE ROARED SUDDENLY. ‚ÄÚWILL YOU ALLOW ME TO ASK YOU ONE QUESTION? ONLY ONE, BUT FRANKLY, DIRECTLY, LIKE A RUSSIAN, FROM THE HEART?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚKINDLY DO SO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHAVE YOU EVER SUFFERED MADAM, IN YOUR LIFE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU SIMPLY MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN OR ARE BEING ILL-TREATED BY SOMEONE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMADAM, MADAM!‚ÄÙ HE JUMPED UP AGAIN, PROBABLY UNCONSCIOUS OF DOING SO, AND STRUCK HIMSELF ON THE BREAST. ‚ÄÚHERE IN THIS BOSOM SO MUCH HAS ACCUMULATED, SO MUCH THAT GOD HIMSELF WILL BE AMAZED WHEN IT IS REVEALED AT THE DAY OF JUDGMENT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚH‚ÄÔM! A STRONG EXPRESSION!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMADAM, I SPEAK PERHAPS IRRITABLY.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT BE UNEASY. I KNOW MYSELF WHEN TO STOP YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMAY I ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION, MADAM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚASK ANOTHER QUESTION.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCAN ONE DIE SIMPLY FROM THE GENEROSITY OF ONE‚ÄÔS FEELINGS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT KNOW, AS I‚ÄÔVE NEVER ASKED MYSELF SUCH A QUESTION.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU DON‚ÄÔT KNOW! YOU‚ÄÔVE NEVER ASKED YOURSELF SUCH A QUESTION,‚ÄÙ HE SAID WITH PATHETIC IRONY. ‚ÄÚWELL, IF THAT‚ÄÔS IT, IF THAT‚ÄÔS IT ‚Ä¶

‚ÄÚBE STILL, DESPAIRING HEART!‚ÄÙ

AND HE STRUCK HIMSELF FURIOUSLY ON THE CHEST. HE WAS BY NOW WALKING ABOUT THE ROOM AGAIN.

IT IS TYPICAL OF SUCH PEOPLE TO BE UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF KEEPING THEIR DESIRES TO THEMSELVES; THEY HAVE, ON THE CONTRARY, AN IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE TO DISPLAY THEM IN ALL THEIR UNSEEMLINESS AS SOON AS THEY ARISE. WHEN SUCH A GENTLEMAN GETS INTO A CIRCLE IN WHICH HE IS NOT AT HOME HE USUALLY BEGINS TIMIDLY,‚ÄÎBUT YOU HAVE ONLY TO GIVE HIM AN INCH AND HE WILL AT ONCE RUSH INTO IMPERTINENCE. THE CAPTAIN WAS ALREADY EXCITED. HE WALKED ABOUT WAVING HIS ARMS AND NOT LISTENING TO QUESTIONS, TALKED ABOUT HIMSELF VERY, VERY QUICKLY, SO THAT SOMETIMES HIS TONGUE WOULD NOT OBEY HIM, AND WITHOUT FINISHING ONE PHRASE HE PASSED TO ANOTHER. IT IS TRUE HE WAS PROBABLY NOT QUITE SOBER. MOREOVER, LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA WAS SITTING THERE TOO, AND THOUGH HE DID NOT ONCE GLANCE AT HER, HER PRESENCE SEEMED TO OVER-EXCITE HIM TERRIBLY; THAT, HOWEVER, IS ONLY MY SUPPOSITION. THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME REASON WHICH LED VARVARA PETROVNA TO RESOLVE TO LISTEN TO SUCH A MAN IN SPITE OF HER REPUGNANCE. PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA WAS SIMPLY SHAKING WITH TERROR, THOUGH, I BELIEVE SHE REALLY DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS ABOUT. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS TREMBLING TOO, BUT THAT WAS, ON THE CONTRARY, BECAUSE HE WAS DISPOSED TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING, AND EXAGGERATE IT. MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH STOOD IN THE ATTITUDE OF ONE READY TO DEFEND ALL PRESENT; LIZA WAS PALE, AND SHE GAZED FIXEDLY WITH WIDE-OPEN EYES AT THE WILD CAPTAIN. SHATOV SAT IN THE SAME POSITION AS BEFORE, BUT, WHAT WAS STRANGEST OF ALL, MARYA TIMOFYEVNA HAD NOT ONLY CEASED LAUGHING, BUT HAD BECOME TERRIBLY SAD. SHE LEANED HER RIGHT ELBOW ON THE TABLE, AND WITH A PROLONGED, MOURNFUL GAZE WATCHED HER BROTHER DECLAIMING. DARYA PAVLOVNA ALONE SEEMED TO ME CALM.

‚ÄÚALL THAT IS NONSENSICAL ALLEGORY,‚ÄÙ SAID VARVARA PETROVNA, GETTING ANGRY AT LAST. ‚ÄÚYOU HAVEN‚ÄÔT ANSWERED MY QUESTION, WHY? I INSIST ON AN ANSWER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI HAVEN‚ÄÔT ANSWERED, WHY? YOU INSIST ON AN ANSWER, WHY?‚ÄÙ REPEATED THE CAPTAIN, WINKING. ‚ÄÚTHAT LITTLE WORD ‚ÄÒWHY‚ÄÔ HAS RUN THROUGH ALL THE UNIVERSE FROM THE FIRST DAY OF CREATION, AND ALL NATURE CRIES EVERY MINUTE TO IT‚ÄÔS CREATOR, ‚ÄÒWHY?‚ÄÔ AND FOR SEVEN THOUSAND YEARS IT HAS HAD NO ANSWER, AND MUST CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN ALONE ANSWER? AND IS THAT JUSTICE, MADAM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS ALL NONSENSE AND NOT TO THE POINT!‚ÄÙ CRIED VARVARA PETROVNA, GETTING ANGRY AND LOSING PATIENCE. ‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS ALLEGORY; BESIDES, YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF TOO SENSATIONALLY, SIR, WHICH I CONSIDER IMPERTINENCE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMADAM,‚ÄÙ THE CAPTAIN WENT ON, NOT HEARING, ‚ÄÚI SHOULD HAVE LIKED PERHAPS TO BE CALLED ERNEST, YET I AM FORCED TO BEAR THE VULGAR NAME IGNAT‚ÄÎWHY IS THAT DO YOU SUPPOSE? I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO BE CALLED PRINCE DE MONBART, YET I AM ONLY LEBYADKIN, DERIVED FROM A SWAN.* WHY IS THAT? I AM A POET, MADAM, A POET IN SOUL, AND MIGHT BE GETTING A THOUSAND ROUBLES AT A TIME FROM A PUBLISHER, YET I AM FORCED TO LIVE IN A PIG PAIL. WHY? WHY, MADAM? TO MY MIND RUSSIA IS A FREAK OF NATURE AND NOTHING ELSE.‚ÄÙ

    * FROM LEBYED, A SWAN.
‚ÄÚCAN YOU REALLY SAY NOTHING MORE DEFINITE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI CAN READ YOU THE POEM, ‚ÄÒTHE COCKROACH,‚ÄÔ MADAM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHA-A-T?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMADAM, I‚ÄÔM NOT MAD YET! I SHALL BE MAD, NO DOUBT I SHALL BE, BUT I‚ÄÔM NOT SO YET. MADAM, A FRIEND OF MINE‚ÄÎA MOST HONOURABLE MAN‚ÄÎHAS WRITTEN A KRYLOV‚ÄÔS FABLE, CALLED ‚ÄÒTHE COCKROACH.‚ÄÔ MAY I READ IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU WANT TO READ SOME FABLE OF KRYLOV‚ÄÔS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, IT‚ÄÔS NOT A FABLE OF KRYLOV‚ÄÔS I WANT TO READ. IT‚ÄÔS MY FABLE, MY OWN COMPOSITION. BELIEVE ME, MADAM, WITHOUT OFFENCE I‚ÄÔM NOT SO UNEDUCATED AND DEPRAVED AS NOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT RUSSIA CAN BOAST OF A GREAT FABLE-WRITER, KRYLOV, TO WHOM THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION HAS RAISED A MONUMENT IN THE SUMMER GARDENS FOR THE DIVERSION OF THE YOUNG. HERE, MADAM, YOU ASK ME WHY? THE ANSWER IS AT THE END OF THIS FABLE, IN LETTERS OF FIRE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚREAD YOUR FABLE.‚ÄÙ

     ‚ÄÚLIVED A COCKROACH IN THE WORLD
     SUCH WAS HIS CONDITION,
     IN A GLASS HE CHANCED TO FALL
     FULL OF FLY-PERDITION.‚ÄÙ
‚ÄÚHEAVENS! WHAT DOES IT MEAN?‚ÄÙ CRIED VARVARA PETROVNA.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS WHEN FLIES GET INTO A GLASS IN THE SUMMER-TIME,‚ÄÙ THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED HURRIEDLY WITH THE IRRITABLE IMPATIENCE OF AN AUTHOR INTERRUPTED IN READING. ‚ÄÚTHEN IT IS PERDITION TO THE FLIES, ANY FOOL CAN UNDERSTAND. DON‚ÄÔT INTERRUPT, DON‚ÄÔT INTERRUPT. YOU‚ÄÔLL SEE, YOU‚ÄÔLL SEE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HE KEPT WAVING HIS ARMS.

     ‚ÄÚBUT HE SQUEEZED AGAINST THE FLIES,
     THEY WOKE UP AND CURSED HIM,
     RAISED TO JOVE THEIR ANGRY CRIES;
     ‚ÄÒTHE GLASS IS FULL TO BURSTING!‚ÄÔ
     IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DIN
     CAME ALONG NIKIFOR,
     FINE OLD MAN, AND LOOKING IN ‚Ä¶
I HAVEN‚ÄÔT QUITE FINISHED IT. BUT NO MATTER, I‚ÄÔLL TELL IT IN WORDS,‚ÄÙ THE CAPTAIN RATTLED ON. ‚ÄÚNIKIFOR TAKES THE GLASS, AND IN SPITE OF THEIR OUTCRY EMPTIES AWAY THE WHOLE STEW, FLIES, AND BEETLES AND ALL, INTO THE PIG PAIL, WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DONE LONG AGO. BUT OBSERVE, MADAM, OBSERVE, THE COCKROACH DOESN‚ÄÔT COMPLAIN. THAT‚ÄÔS THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION, WHY?‚ÄÙ HE CRIED TRIUMPHANTLY. ‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒTHE COCKROACH DOES NOT COMPLAIN.‚ÄÔ AS FOR NIKIFOR HE TYPIFIES NATURE,‚ÄÙ HE ADDED, SPEAKING RAPIDLY AND WALKING COMPLACENTLY ABOUT THE ROOM.

VARVARA PETROVNA WAS TERRIBLY ANGRY.

‚ÄÚAND ALLOW ME TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT MONEY SAID TO HAVE BEEN RECEIVED FROM NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, AND NOT TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO YOU, ABOUT WHICH YOU DARED TO ACCUSE A PERSON BELONGING TO MY HOUSEHOLD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS A SLANDER!‚ÄÙ ROARED LEBYADKIN, FLINGING UP HIS RIGHT HAND TRAGICALLY.

‚ÄÚNO, IT‚ÄÔS NOT A SLANDER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMADAM, THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT FORCE ONE TO ENDURE FAMILY DISGRACE RATHER THAN PROCLAIM THE TRUTH ALOUD. LEBYADKIN WILL NOT BLAB, MADAM!‚ÄÙ

HE SEEMED DAZED; HE WAS CARRIED AWAY; HE FELT HIS IMPORTANCE; HE CERTAINLY HAD SOME FANCY IN HIS MIND. BY NOW HE WANTED TO INSULT SOME ONE, TO DO SOMETHING NASTY TO SHOW HIS POWER.

‚ÄÚRING, PLEASE, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH,‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA ASKED HIM.

‚ÄÚLEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS CUNNING, MADAM,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, WINKING WITH HIS EVIL SMILE; ‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS CUNNING, BUT HE TOO HAS A WEAK SPOT, HE TOO AT TIMES IS IN THE PORTALS OF PASSIONS, AND THESE PORTALS ARE THE OLD MILITARY HUSSARS‚ÄÔ BOTTLE, CELEBRATED BY DENIS DAVYDOV. SO WHEN HE IS IN THOSE PORTALS, MADAM, HE MAY HAPPEN TO SEND A LETTER IN VERSE, A MOST MAGNIFICENT LETTER‚ÄÎBUT WHICH AFTERWARDS HE WOULD HAVE WISHED TO TAKE BACK, WITH THE TEARS OF ALL HIS LIFE; FOR THE FEELING OF THE BEAUTIFUL IS DESTROYED. BUT THE BIRD HAS FLOWN, YOU WON‚ÄÔT CATCH IT BY THE TAIL. IN THOSE PORTALS NOW, MADAM, LEBYADKIN MAY HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT AN HONOURABLE YOUNG LADY, IN THE HONOURABLE INDIGNATION OF A SOUL REVOLTED BY WRONGS, AND HIS SLANDERERS HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IT. BUT LEBYADKIN IS CUNNING, MADAM! AND IN VAIN A MALIGNANT WOLF SITS OVER HIM EVERY MINUTE, FILLING HIS GLASS AND WAITING FOR THE END. LEBYADKIN WON‚ÄÔT BLAB. AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE HE ALWAYS FINDS INSTEAD LEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS CUNNING. BUT ENOUGH, OH, ENOUGH, MADAM! YOUR SPLENDID HALLS MIGHT BELONG TO THE NOBLEST IN THE LAND, BUT THE COCKROACH WILL NOT COMPLAIN. OBSERVE THAT, OBSERVE THAT HE DOES NOT COMPLAIN, AND RECOGNISE HIS NOBLE SPIRIT!‚ÄÙ

AT THAT INSTANT A BELL RANG DOWNSTAIRS FROM THE PORTER‚ÄÔS ROOM, AND ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT ALEXEY YEGORYTCH APPEARED IN RESPONSE TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS RING, WHICH HE HAD SOMEWHAT DELAYED ANSWERING. THE CORRECT OLD SERVANT WAS UNUSUALLY EXCITED.

‚ÄÚNIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAS GRACIOUSLY ARRIVED THIS MOMENT AND IS COMING HERE,‚ÄÙ HE PRONOUNCED, IN REPLY TO VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS QUESTIONING GLANCE. I PARTICULARLY REMEMBER HER AT THAT MOMENT; AT FIRST SHE TURNED PALE, BUT SUDDENLY HER EYES FLASHED. SHE DREW HERSELF UP IN HER CHAIR WITH AN AIR OF EXTRAORDINARY DETERMINATION. EVERY ONE WAS ASTOUNDED INDEED. THE UTTERLY UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL OF NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, WHO WAS NOT EXPECTED FOR ANOTHER MONTH, WAS NOT ONLY STRANGE FROM ITS UNEXPECTEDNESS BUT FROM ITS FATEFUL COINCIDENCE WITH THE PRESENT MOMENT. EVEN THE CAPTAIN REMAINED STANDING LIKE A POST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WITH HIS MOUTH WIDE OPEN, STARING AT THE DOOR WITH A FEARFULLY STUPID EXPRESSION.

AND, BEHOLD, FROM THE NEXT ROOM‚ÄÎA VERY LARGE AND LONG APARTMENT‚ÄÎCAME THE SOUND OF SWIFTLY APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS, LITTLE, EXCEEDINGLY RAPID STEPS; SOMEONE SEEMED TO BE RUNNING, AND THAT SOMEONE SUDDENLY FLEW INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM, NOT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, BUT A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS A COMPLETE STRANGER TO ALL.

V

I WILL PERMIT MYSELF TO HALT HERE TO SKETCH IN A FEW HURRIED STROKES THIS PERSON WHO HAD SO SUDDENLY ARRIVED ON THE SCENE.

HE WAS A YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY-SEVEN OR THEREABOUTS, A LITTLE ABOVE THE MEDIUM HEIGHT, WITH RATHER LONG, LANK, FLAXEN HAIR, AND WITH FAINTLY DEFINED, IRREGULAR MOUSTACHE AND BEARD. HE WAS DRESSED NEATLY, AND IN THE FASHION, THOUGH NOT LIKE A DANDY. AT THE FIRST GLANCE HE LOOKED ROUND-SHOULDERED AND AWKWARD, BUT YET HE WAS NOT ROUND-SHOULDERED, AND HIS MANNER WAS EASY. HE SEEMED A QUEER FISH, AND YET LATER ON WE ALL THOUGHT HIS MANNERS GOOD, AND HIS CONVERSATION ALWAYS TO THE POINT.

NO ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HE WAS UGLY, AND YET NO ONE WOULD HAVE LIKED HIS FACE. HIS HEAD WAS ELONGATED AT THE BACK, AND LOOKED FLATTENED AT THE SIDES, SO THAT HIS FACE SEEMED POINTED, HIS FOREHEAD WAS HIGH AND NARROW, BUT HIS FEATURES WERE SMALL; HIS EYES WERE KEEN, HIS NOSE WAS SMALL AND SHARP, HIS LIPS WERE LONG AND THIN. THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE SUGGESTED ILL-HEALTH, BUT THIS WAS MISLEADING. HE HAD A WRINKLE ON EACH CHEEK WHICH GAVE HIM THE LOOK OF A MAN WHO HAD JUST RECOVERED FROM A SERIOUS ILLNESS. YET HE WAS PERFECTLY WELL AND STRONG, AND HAD NEVER BEEN ILL.

HE WALKED AND MOVED VERY HURRIEDLY, YET NEVER SEEMED IN A HURRY TO BE OFF. IT SEEMED AS THOUGH NOTHING COULD DISCONCERT HIM; IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE AND IN EVERY SORT OF SOCIETY HE REMAINED THE SAME. HE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF CONCEIT, BUT WAS UTTERLY UNAWARE OF IT HIMSELF.

HE TALKED QUICKLY, HURRIEDLY, BUT AT THE SAME TIME WITH ASSURANCE, AND WAS NEVER AT A LOSS FOR A WORD. IN SPITE OF HIS HURRIED MANNER HIS IDEAS WERE IN PERFECT ORDER, DISTINCT AND DEFINITE‚ÄÎAND THIS WAS PARTICULARLY STRIKING. HIS ARTICULATION WAS WONDERFULLY CLEAR. HIS WORDS PATTERED OUT LIKE SMOOTH, BIG GRAINS, ALWAYS WELL CHOSEN, AND AT YOUR SERVICE. AT FIRST THIS ATTRACTED ONE, BUT AFTERWARDS IT BECAME REPULSIVE, JUST BECAUSE OF THIS OVER-DISTINCT ARTICULATION, THIS STRING OF EVER-READY WORDS. ONE SOMEHOW BEGAN TO IMAGINE THAT HE MUST HAVE A TONGUE OF SPECIAL SHAPE, SOMEHOW EXCEPTIONALLY LONG AND THIN, EXTREMELY RED WITH A VERY SHARP EVERLASTINGLY ACTIVE LITTLE TIP.

WELL, THIS WAS THE YOUNG MAN WHO DARTED NOW INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM, AND REALLY, I BELIEVE TO THIS DAY, THAT HE BEGAN TO TALK IN THE NEXT ROOM, AND CAME IN SPEAKING. HE WAS STANDING BEFORE VARVARA PETROVNA IN A TRICE.

‚ÄÚ‚Ä¶ ONLY FANCY, VARVARA PETROVNA,‚ÄÙ HE PATTERED ON, ‚ÄÚI CAME IN EXPECTING TO FIND HE‚ÄÔD BEEN HERE FOR THE LAST QUARTER OF AN HOUR; HE ARRIVED AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO; WE MET AT KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS: HE SET OFF HALF AN HOUR AGO MEANING TO COME STRAIGHT HERE, AND TOLD ME TO COME HERE TOO, A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT WHO? WHO TOLD YOU TO COME HERE?‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA INQUIRED.

‚ÄÚWHY, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH! SURELY THIS ISN‚ÄÔT THE FIRST YOU‚ÄÔVE HEARD OF IT! BUT HIS LUGGAGE MUST HAVE BEEN HERE A LONG WHILE, ANYWAY. HOW IS IT YOU WEREN‚ÄÔT TOLD? THEN I‚ÄÔM THE FIRST TO BRING THE NEWS. ONE MIGHT SEND OUT TO LOOK FOR HIM; HE‚ÄÔS SURE TO BE HERE HIMSELF DIRECTLY THOUGH. AND I FANCY, AT THE MOMENT THAT JUST FITS IN WITH SOME OF HIS EXPECTATIONS, AND IS FAR AS I CAN JUDGE, AT LEAST, SOME OF HIS CALCULATIONS.‚ÄÙ

AT THIS POINT HE TURNED HIS EYES ABOUT THE ROOM AND FIXED THEM WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION ON THE CAPTAIN.

‚ÄÚACH, LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA, HOW GLAD I AM TO MEET YOU AT THE VERY FIRST STEP, DELIGHTED TO SHAKE HANDS WITH YOU.‚ÄÙ HE FLEW UP TO LIZA, WHO WAS SMILING GAILY, TO TAKE HER PROFFERED HAND, ‚ÄÚAND I OBSERVE THAT MY HONOURED FRIEND PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA HAS NOT FORGOTTEN HER ‚ÄÒPROFESSOR,‚ÄÔ AND ACTUALLY ISN‚ÄÔT CROSS WITH HIM, AS SHE ALWAYS USED TO BE IN SWITZERLAND. BUT HOW ARE YOUR LEGS, HERE, PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA, AND WERE THE SWISS DOCTORS RIGHT WHEN AT THE CONSULTATION THEY PRESCRIBED YOUR NATIVE AIR? WHAT? FOMENTATIONS? THAT OUGHT TO DO GOOD. BUT HOW SORRY I WAS, VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÙ (HE TURNED RAPIDLY TO HER) ‚ÄÚTHAT I DIDN‚ÄÔT ARRIVE IN TIME TO MEET YOU ABROAD, AND OFFER MY RESPECTS TO YOU IN PERSON; I HAD SO MUCH TO TELL YOU TOO. I DID SEND WORD TO MY OLD MAN HERE, BUT I FANCY THAT HE DID AS HE ALWAYS DOES ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPETRUSHA!‚ÄÙ CRIED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, INSTANTLY ROUSED FROM HIS STUPEFACTION. HE CLASPED HIS HANDS AND FLEW TO HIS SON. ‚ÄÚPIERRE, MON ENFANT! WHY, I DIDN‚ÄÔT KNOW YOU!‚ÄÙ HE PRESSED HIM IN HIS ARMS AND THE TEARS ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS.

‚ÄÚCOME, BE QUIET, BE QUIET, NO FLOURISHES, THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH, THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH, PLEASE,‚ÄÙ PETRUSHA MUTTERED HURRIEDLY, TRYING TO EXTRICATE HIMSELF FROM HIS EMBRACE.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE ALWAYS SINNED AGAINST YOU, ALWAYS!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH. WE CAN TALK OF THAT LATER. I KNEW YOU‚ÄÔD CARRY ON. COME, BE A LITTLE MORE SOBER, PLEASE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT IT‚ÄÔS TEN YEARS SINCE I‚ÄÔVE SEEN YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE LESS REASON FOR DEMONSTRATIONS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMON ENFANT!‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCOME, I BELIEVE IN YOUR AFFECTION, I BELIEVE IN IT, TAKE YOUR ARMS AWAY. YOU SEE, YOU‚ÄÔRE DISTURBING OTHER PEOPLE.‚Ä¶ AH, HERE‚ÄÔS NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH; KEEP QUIET, PLEASE.‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS ALREADY IN THE ROOM; HE CAME IN VERY QUIETLY AND STOOD STILL FOR AN INSTANT IN THE DOORWAY, QUIETLY SCRUTINISING THE COMPANY.

I WAS STRUCK BY THE FIRST SIGHT OF HIM JUST AS I HAD BEEN FOUR YEARS BEFORE, WHEN I SAW HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME. I HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HIM IN THE LEAST. BUT I THINK THERE ARE SOME COUNTENANCES WHICH ALWAYS SEEM TO EXHIBIT SOMETHING NEW WHICH ONE HAS NOT NOTICED BEFORE, EVERY TIME ONE MEETS THEM, THOUGH ONE MAY HAVE SEEN THEM A HUNDRED TIMES ALREADY. APPARENTLY HE WAS EXACTLY THE SAME AS HE HAD BEEN FOUR YEARS BEFORE. HE WAS AS ELEGANT, AS DIGNIFIED, HE MOVED WITH THE SAME AIR OF CONSEQUENCE AS BEFORE, INDEED HE LOOKED ALMOST AS YOUNG. HIS FAINT SMILE HAD JUST THE SAME OFFICIAL GRACIOUSNESS AND COMPLACENCY. HIS EYES HAD THE SAME STERN, THOUGHTFUL AND, AS IT WERE, PREOCCUPIED LOOK. IN FACT, IT SEEMED AS THOUGH WE HAD ONLY PARTED THE DAY BEFORE. BUT ONE THING STRUCK ME. IN OLD DAYS, THOUGH HE HAD BEEN CONSIDERED HANDSOME, HIS FACE WAS ‚ÄÚLIKE A MASK,‚ÄÙ AS SOME OF OUR SHARP-TONGUED LADIES HAD EXPRESSED IT. NOW‚ÄÎNOW, I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHY HE IMPRESSED ME AT ONCE AS ABSOLUTELY, INCONTESTABLY BEAUTIFUL, SO THAT NO ONE COULD HAVE SAID THAT HIS FACE WAS LIKE A MASK. WASN‚ÄÔT IT PERHAPS THAT HE WAS A LITTLE PALER AND SEEMED RATHER THINNER THAN BEFORE? OR WAS THERE, PERHAPS, THE LIGHT OF SOME NEW IDEA IN HIS EYES?

‚ÄÚNIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH!‚ÄÙ CRIED VARVARA PETROVNA, DRAWING HERSELF UP BUT NOT RISING FROM HER CHAIR. ‚ÄÚSTOP A MINUTE!‚ÄÙ SHE CHECKED HIS ADVANCE WITH A PEREMPTORY GESTURE.

BUT TO EXPLAIN THE AWFUL QUESTION WHICH IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED THAT GESTURE AND EXCLAMATION‚ÄÎA QUESTION WHICH I SHOULD HAVE IMAGINED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE EVEN IN VARVARA PETROVNA, I MUST ASK THE READER TO REMEMBER WHAT THAT LADY‚ÄÔS TEMPERAMENT HAD ALWAYS BEEN, AND THE EXTRAORDINARY IMPULSIVENESS SHE SHOWED AT SOME CRITICAL MOMENTS. I BEG HIM TO CONSIDER ALSO, THAT IN SPITE OF THE EXCEPTIONAL STRENGTH OF HER SPIRIT AND THE VERY CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF COMMON SENSE AND PRACTICAL, SO TO SAY BUSINESS, TACT SHE POSSESSED, THERE WERE MOMENTS IN HER LIFE IN WHICH SHE ABANDONED HERSELF ALTOGETHER, ENTIRELY AND, IF IT‚ÄÔS PERMISSIBLE TO SAY SO, ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT RESTRAINT. I BEG HIM TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ALSO THAT THE PRESENT MOMENT MIGHT REALLY BE FOR HER ONE OF THOSE IN WHICH ALL THE ESSENCE OF LIFE, OF ALL THE PAST AND ALL THE PRESENT, PERHAPS, TOO, ALL THE FUTURE, IS CONCENTRATED, AS IT WERE, FOCUSED. I MUST BRIEFLY RECALL, TOO, THE ANONYMOUS LETTER OF WHICH SHE HAD SPOKEN TO PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA WITH SO MUCH IRRITATION, THOUGH I THINK SHE SAID NOTHING OF THE LATTER PART OF IT. YET IT PERHAPS CONTAINED THE EXPLANATION OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE TERRIBLE QUESTION WITH WHICH SHE SUDDENLY ADDRESSED HER SON.

‚ÄÚNIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH,‚ÄÙ SHE REPEATED, RAPPING OUT HER WORDS IN A RESOLUTE VOICE IN WHICH THERE WAS A RING OF MENACING CHALLENGE, ‚ÄÚI BEG YOU TO TELL ME AT ONCE, WITHOUT MOVING FROM THAT PLACE; IS IT TRUE THAT THIS UNHAPPY CRIPPLE‚ÄÎHERE SHE IS, HERE, LOOK AT HER‚ÄÎIS IT TRUE THAT SHE IS ‚Ä¶ YOUR LAWFUL WIFE?‚ÄÙ

I REMEMBER THAT MOMENT ONLY TOO WELL; HE DID NOT WINK AN EYELASH BUT LOOKED INTENTLY AT HIS MOTHER. NOT THE FAINTEST CHANGE IN HIS FACE FOLLOWED. AT LAST HE SMILED, A SORT OF INDULGENT SMILE, AND WITHOUT ANSWERING A WORD WENT QUIETLY UP TO HIS MOTHER, TOOK HER HAND, RAISED IT RESPECTFULLY TO HIS LIPS AND KISSED IT. AND SO GREAT WAS HIS INVARIABLE AND IRRESISTIBLE ASCENDANCY OVER HIS MOTHER THAT EVEN NOW SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO PULL AWAY HER HAND. SHE ONLY GAZED AT HIM, HER WHOLE FIGURE ONE CONCENTRATED QUESTION, SEEMING TO BETRAY THAT SHE COULD NOT BEAR THE SUSPENSE ANOTHER MOMENT.

BUT HE WAS STILL SILENT. WHEN HE HAD KISSED HER HAND, HE SCANNED THE WHOLE ROOM ONCE MORE, AND MOVING, AS BEFORE, WITHOUT HASTE WENT TOWARDS MARYA TIMOFYEVNA. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE PEOPLE‚ÄÔS COUNTENANCES AT CERTAIN MOMENTS. I REMEMBER, FOR INSTANCE, THAT MARYA TIMOFYEVNA, BREATHLESS WITH FEAR, ROSE TO HER FEET TO MEET HIM AND CLASPED HER HANDS BEFORE HER, AS THOUGH BESEECHING HIM. AND AT THE SAME TIME I REMEMBER THE FRANTIC ECSTASY WHICH ALMOST DISTORTED HER FACE‚ÄÎAN ECSTASY ALMOST TOO GREAT FOR ANY HUMAN BEING TO BEAR. PERHAPS BOTH WERE THERE, BOTH THE TERROR AND THE ECSTASY. BUT I REMEMBER MOVING QUICKLY TOWARDS HER (I WAS STANDING NOT FAR OFF), FOR I FANCIED SHE WAS GOING TO FAINT.

‚ÄÚYOU SHOULD NOT BE HERE,‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SAID TO HER IN A CARESSING AND MELODIOUS VOICE; AND THERE WAS THE LIGHT OF AN EXTRAORDINARY TENDERNESS IN HIS EYES. HE STOOD BEFORE HER IN THE MOST RESPECTFUL ATTITUDE, AND EVERY GESTURE SHOWED SINCERE RESPECT FOR HER. THE POOR GIRL FALTERED IMPULSIVELY IN A HALF-WHISPER.

‚ÄÚBUT MAY I ‚Ä¶ KNEEL DOWN ‚Ä¶ TO YOU NOW?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, YOU CAN‚ÄÔT DO THAT.‚ÄÙ

HE SMILED AT HER MAGNIFICENTLY, SO THAT SHE TOO LAUGHED JOYFULLY AT ONCE. IN THE SAME MELODIOUS VOICE, COAXING HER TENDERLY AS THOUGH SHE WERE A CHILD, HE WENT ON GRAVELY.

‚ÄÚONLY THINK THAT YOU ARE A GIRL, AND THAT THOUGH I‚ÄÔM YOUR DEVOTED FRIEND I‚ÄÔM AN OUTSIDER, NOT YOUR HUSBAND, NOR YOUR FATHER, NOR YOUR BETROTHED. GIVE ME YOUR ARM AND LET US GO; I WILL TAKE YOU TO THE CARRIAGE, AND IF YOU WILL LET ME I WILL SEE YOU ALL THE WAY HOME.‚ÄÙ

SHE LISTENED, AND BENT HER HEAD AS THOUGH MEDITATING.

‚ÄÚLET‚ÄÔS GO,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID WITH A SIGH, GIVING HIM HER HAND.

BUT AT THAT POINT A SLIGHT MISCHANCE BEFELL HER. SHE MUST HAVE TURNED CARELESSLY, RESTING ON HER LAME LEG, WHICH WAS SHORTER THAN THE OTHER. SHE FELL SIDEWAYS INTO THE CHAIR, AND IF THE CHAIR HAD NOT BEEN THERE WOULD HAVE FALLEN ON TO THE FLOOR. HE INSTANTLY SEIZED AND SUPPORTED HER, AND HOLDING HER ARM FIRMLY IN HIS, LED HER CAREFULLY AND SYMPATHETICALLY TO THE DOOR. SHE WAS EVIDENTLY MORTIFIED AT HAVING FALLEN; SHE WAS OVERWHELMED, BLUSHED, AND WAS TERRIBLY ABASHED. LOOKING DUMBLY ON THE GROUND, LIMPING PAINFULLY, SHE HOBBLED AFTER HIM, ALMOST HANGING ON HIS ARM. SO THEY WENT OUT. LIZA, I SAW, SUDDENLY JUMPED UP FROM HER CHAIR FOR SOME REASON AS THEY WERE GOING OUT, AND SHE FOLLOWED THEM WITH INTENT EYES TILL THEY REACHED THE DOOR. THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN IN SILENCE, BUT THERE WAS A NERVOUS TWITCHING IN HER FACE, AS THOUGH SHE HAD TOUCHED A VIPER.

WHILE THIS SCENE WAS TAKING PLACE BETWEEN NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH AND MARYA TIMOFYEVNA EVERY ONE WAS SPEECHLESS WITH AMAZEMENT; ONE COULD HAVE HEARD A FLY; BUT AS SOON AS THEY HAD GONE OUT, EVERY ONE BEGAN SUDDENLY TALKING.

VI

IT WAS VERY LITTLE OF IT TALK, HOWEVER; IT WAS MOSTLY EXCLAMATION. I‚ÄÔVE FORGOTTEN A LITTLE THE ORDER IN WHICH THINGS HAPPENED, FOR A SCENE OF CONFUSION FOLLOWED. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH UTTERED SOME EXCLAMATION IN FRENCH, CLASPING HIS HANDS, BUT VARVARA PETROVNA HAD NO THOUGHT FOR HIM. EVEN MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH MUTTERED SOME RAPID, JERKY COMMENT. BUT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS THE MOST EXCITED OF ALL. HE WAS TRYING DESPERATELY WITH BOLD GESTICULATIONS TO PERSUADE VARVARA PETROVNA OF SOMETHING, BUT IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE I COULD MAKE OUT WHAT IT WAS. HE APPEALED TO PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA, AND LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA TOO, EVEN, IN HIS EXCITEMENT, ADDRESSED A PASSING SHOUT TO HIS FATHER‚ÄÎIN FACT HE SEEMED ALL OVER THE ROOM AT ONCE. VARVARA PETROVNA, FLUSHING ALL OVER, SPRANG UP FROM HER SEAT AND CRIED TO PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA:

‚ÄÚDID YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID TO HER HERE JUST NOW, DID YOU HEAR IT?‚ÄÙ

BUT THE LATTER WAS INCAPABLE OF REPLYING. SHE COULD ONLY MUTTER SOMETHING AND WAVE HER HAND. THE POOR WOMAN HAD TROUBLES OF HER OWN TO THINK ABOUT. SHE KEPT TURNING HER HEAD TOWARDS LIZA AND WAS WATCHING HER WITH UNACCOUNTABLE TERROR, BUT SHE DIDN‚ÄÔT EVEN DARE TO THINK OF GETTING UP AND GOING AWAY UNTIL HER DAUGHTER SHOULD GET UP. IN THE MEANTIME THE CAPTAIN WANTED TO SLIP AWAY. THAT I NOTICED. THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT HE HAD BEEN IN A GREAT PANIC FROM THE INSTANT THAT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAD MADE HIS APPEARANCE; BUT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH TOOK HIM BY THE ARM AND WOULD NOT LET HIM GO.

‚ÄÚIT IS NECESSARY, QUITE NECESSARY,‚ÄÙ HE PATTERED ON TO VARVARA PETROVNA, STILL TRYING TO PERSUADE HER. HE STOOD FACING HER, AS SHE WAS SITTING DOWN AGAIN IN HER EASY CHAIR, AND, I REMEMBER, WAS LISTENING TO HIM EAGERLY; HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN SECURING HER ATTENTION.

‚ÄÚIT IS NECESSARY. YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF, VARVARA PETROVNA, THAT THERE IS A MISUNDERSTANDING HERE, AND MUCH THAT IS STRANGE ON THE SURFACE, AND YET THE THING‚ÄÔS AS CLEAR AS DAYLIGHT, AND AS SIMPLE AS MY FINGER. I QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT NO ONE HAS AUTHORISED ME TO TELL THE STORY, AND I DARE SAY I LOOK RIDICULOUS PUTTING MYSELF FORWARD. BUT IN THE FIRST PLACE, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH ATTACHES NO SORT OF SIGNIFICANCE TO THE MATTER HIMSELF, AND, BESIDES, THERE ARE INCIDENTS OF WHICH IT IS DIFFICULT FOR A MAN TO MAKE UP HIS MIND TO GIVE AN EXPLANATION HIMSELF. AND SO IT‚ÄÔS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT IT SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN BY A THIRD PERSON, FOR WHOM IT‚ÄÔS EASIER TO PUT SOME DELICATE POINTS INTO WORDS. BELIEVE ME, VARVARA PETROVNA, THAT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH IS NOT AT ALL TO BLAME FOR NOT IMMEDIATELY ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION JUST NOW WITH A FULL EXPLANATION, IT‚ÄÔS ALL A TRIVIAL AFFAIR. I‚ÄÔVE KNOWN HIM SINCE HIS PETERSBURG DAYS. BESIDES, THE WHOLE STORY ONLY DOES HONOUR TO NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, IF ONE MUST MAKE USE OF THAT VAGUE WORD ‚ÄÒHONOUR.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU WERE A WITNESS OF SOME INCIDENT WHICH GAVE RISE ‚Ä¶ TO THIS MISUNDERSTANDING?‚ÄÙ ASKED VARVARA PETROVNA.

‚ÄÚI WITNESSED IT, AND TOOK PART IN IT,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HASTENED TO DECLARE.

‚ÄÚIF YOU‚ÄÔLL GIVE ME YOUR WORD THAT THIS WILL NOT WOUND NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH‚ÄÔS DELICACY IN REGARD TO HIS FEELING FOR ME, FROM WHOM HE NE-E-VER CONCEALS ANYTHING ‚Ä¶ AND IF YOU ARE CONVINCED ALSO THAT YOUR DOING THIS WILL BE AGREEABLE TO HIM ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCERTAINLY IT WILL BE AGREEABLE, AND FOR THAT REASON I CONSIDER IT A PARTICULARLY AGREEABLE DUTY. I AM CONVINCED THAT HE WOULD BEG ME TO DO IT HIMSELF.‚ÄÙ

THE INTRUSIVE DESIRE OF THIS GENTLEMAN, WHO SEEMED TO HAVE DROPPED ON US FROM HEAVEN TO TELL STORIES ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE‚ÄÔS AFFAIRS, WAS RATHER STRANGE AND INCONSISTENT WITH ORDINARY USAGE.

BUT HE HAD CAUGHT VARVARA PETROVNA BY TOUCHING ON TOO PAINFUL A SPOT. I DID NOT KNOW THE MAN‚ÄÔS CHARACTER AT THAT TIME, AND STILL LESS HIS DESIGNS.

‚ÄÚI AM LISTENING,‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA ANNOUNCED WITH A RESERVED AND CAUTIOUS MANNER. SHE WAS RATHER PAINFULLY AWARE OF HER CONDESCENSION.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS A SHORT STORY; IN FACT IF YOU LIKE IT‚ÄÔS NOT A STORY AT ALL,‚ÄÙ HE RATTLED ON, ‚ÄÚTHOUGH A NOVELIST MIGHT WORK IT UP INTO A NOVEL IN AN IDLE HOUR. IT‚ÄÔS RATHER AN INTERESTING LITTLE INCIDENT, PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA, AND I AM SURE THAT LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA WILL BE INTERESTED TO HEAR IT, BECAUSE THERE ARE A GREAT MANY THINGS IN IT THAT ARE ODD IF NOT WONDERFUL. FIVE YEARS AGO, IN PETERSBURG, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THIS GENTLEMAN, THIS VERY MR. LEBYADKIN WHO‚ÄÔS STANDING HERE WITH HIS MOUTH OPEN, ANXIOUS, I THINK, TO SLIP AWAY AT ONCE. EXCUSE ME, VARVARA PETROVNA. I DON‚ÄÔT ADVISE YOU TO MAKE YOUR ESCAPE THOUGH, YOU DISCHARGED CLERK IN THE FORMER COMMISSARIAT DEPARTMENT; YOU SEE, I REMEMBER YOU VERY WELL. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH AND I KNOW VERY WELL WHAT YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN UP TO HERE, AND, DON‚ÄÔT FORGET, YOU‚ÄÔLL HAVE TO ANSWER FOR IT. I ASK YOUR PARDON ONCE MORE, VARVARA PETROVNA. IN THOSE DAYS NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH USED TO CALL THIS GENTLEMAN HIS FALSTAFF; THAT MUST BE,‚ÄÙ HE EXPLAINED SUDDENLY, ‚ÄÚSOME OLD BURLESQUE CHARACTER, AT WHOM EVERY ONE LAUGHS, AND WHO IS WILLING TO LET EVERY ONE LAUGH AT HIM, IF ONLY THEY‚ÄÔLL PAY HIM FOR IT. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS LEADING AT THAT TIME IN PETERSBURG A LIFE, SO TO SAY, OF MOCKERY. I CAN‚ÄÔT FIND ANOTHER WORD TO DESCRIBE IT, BECAUSE HE IS NOT A MAN WHO FALLS INTO DISILLUSIONMENT, AND HE DISDAINED TO BE OCCUPIED WITH WORK AT THAT TIME. I‚ÄÔM ONLY SPEAKING OF THAT PERIOD, VARVARA PETROVNA. LEBYADKIN HAD A SISTER, THE WOMAN WHO WAS SITTING HERE JUST NOW. THE BROTHER AND SISTER HADN‚ÄÔT A CORNER* OF THEIR OWN, BUT WERE ALWAYS QUARTERING THEMSELVES ON DIFFERENT PEOPLE. HE USED TO HANG ABOUT THE ARCADES IN THE GOSTINY DVOR, ALWAYS WEARING HIS OLD UNIFORM, AND WOULD STOP THE MORE RESPECTABLE-LOOKING PASSERS-BY, AND EVERYTHING HE GOT FROM THEM HE‚ÄÔD SPEND IN DRINK. HIS SISTER LIVED LIKE THE BIRDS OF HEAVEN. SHE‚ÄÔD HELP PEOPLE IN THEIR ‚ÄÒCORNERS,‚ÄÔ AND DO JOBS FOR THEM ON OCCASION. IT WAS A REGULAR BEDLAM. I‚ÄÔLL PASS OVER THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS LIFE IN ‚ÄÒCORNERS,‚ÄÔ A LIFE TO WHICH NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAD TAKEN,‚ÄÙ

     * IN THE POORER QUARTERS OF RUSSIAN TOWNS A SINGLE ROOM IS OFTEN
     LET OUT TO SEVERAL FAMILIES, EACH OF WHICH OCCUPIES A ‚ÄÚCORNER.‚ÄÙ
‚ÄÚAT THAT TIME, FROM ECCENTRICITY. I‚ÄÔM ONLY TALKING OF THAT PERIOD, VARVARA PETROVNA; AS FOR ‚ÄÒECCENTRICITY,‚ÄÔ THAT‚ÄÔS HIS OWN EXPRESSION. HE DOES NOT CONCEAL MUCH FROM ME. MLLE. LEBYADKIN, WHO WAS THROWN IN THE WAY OF MEETING NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH VERY OFTEN, AT ONE TIME, WAS FASCINATED BY HIS APPEARANCE. HE WAS, SO TO SAY, A DIAMOND SET IN THE DIRTY BACKGROUND OF HER LIFE. I AM A POOR HAND AT DESCRIBING FEELINGS, SO I‚ÄÔLL PASS THEM OVER; BUT SOME OF THAT DIRTY LOT TOOK TO JEERING AT HER ONCE, AND IT MADE HER SAD. THEY ALWAYS HAD LAUGHED AT HER, BUT SHE DID NOT SEEM TO NOTICE IT BEFORE. SHE WASN‚ÄÔT QUITE RIGHT IN HER HEAD EVEN THEN, BUT VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT SHE IS NOW. THERE‚ÄÔS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IN HER CHILDHOOD SHE RECEIVED SOMETHING LIKE AN EDUCATION THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF A BENEVOLENT LADY. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAD NEVER TAKEN THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE OF HER. HE USED TO SPEND HIS TIME CHIEFLY IN PLAYING PREFERENCE WITH A GREASY OLD PACK OF CARDS FOR STAKES OF A QUARTER-FARTHING WITH CLERKS. BUT ONCE, WHEN SHE WAS BEING ILL-TREATED, HE WENT UP (WITHOUT INQUIRING INTO THE CAUSE) AND SEIZED ONE OF THE CLERKS BY THE COLLAR AND FLUNG HIM OUT OF A SECOND-FLOOR WINDOW. IT WAS NOT A CASE OF CHIVALROUS INDIGNATION AT THE SIGHT OF INJURED INNOCENCE; THE WHOLE OPERATION TOOK PLACE IN THE MIDST OF ROARS OF LAUGHTER, AND THE ONE WHO LAUGHED LOUDEST WAS NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HIMSELF. AS IT ALL ENDED WITHOUT HARM, THEY WERE RECONCILED AND BEGAN DRINKING PUNCH. BUT THE INJURED INNOCENT HERSELF DID NOT FORGET IT. OF COURSE IT ENDED IN HER BECOMING COMPLETELY CRAZY. I REPEAT I‚ÄÔM A POOR HAND AT DESCRIBING FEELINGS. BUT A DELUSION WAS THE CHIEF FEATURE IN THIS CASE. AND NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH AGGRAVATED THAT DELUSION AS THOUGH HE DID IT ON PURPOSE. INSTEAD OF LAUGHING AT HER HE BEGAN ALL AT ONCE TREATING MLLE. LEBYADKIN WITH SUDDEN RESPECT. KIRILLOV, WHO WAS THERE (A VERY ORIGINAL MAN, VARVARA PETROVNA, AND VERY ABRUPT, YOU‚ÄÔLL SEE HIM PERHAPS ONE DAY, FOR HE‚ÄÔS HERE NOW), WELL, THIS KIRILLOV WHO, AS A RULE, IS PERFECTLY SILENT, SUDDENLY GOT HOT, AND SAID TO NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, I REMEMBER, THAT HE TREATED THE GIRL AS THOUGH SHE WERE A MARQUISE, AND THAT THAT WAS DOING FOR HER ALTOGETHER. I MUST ADD THAT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAD RATHER A RESPECT FOR THIS KIRILLOV. WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE WAS THE ANSWER HE GAVE HIM: ‚ÄÒYOU IMAGINE, MR. KIRILLOV, THAT I AM LAUGHING AT HER. GET RID OF THAT IDEA, I REALLY DO RESPECT HER, FOR SHE‚ÄÔS BETTER THAN ANY OF US.‚ÄÔ AND, DO YOU KNOW, HE SAID IT IN SUCH A SERIOUS TONE. MEANWHILE, HE HADN‚ÄÔT REALLY SAID A WORD TO HER FOR TWO OR THREE MONTHS, EXCEPT ‚ÄÒGOOD MORNING‚ÄÔ AND ‚ÄÒGOOD-BYE.‚ÄÔ I REMEMBER, FOR I WAS THERE, THAT SHE CAME AT LAST TO THE POINT OF LOOKING ON HIM ALMOST AS HER BETROTHED WHO DARED NOT ‚ÄÒELOPE WITH HER,‚ÄÔ SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD MANY ENEMIES AND FAMILY DIFFICULTIES, OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT. THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF LAUGHTER ABOUT IT. IT ENDED IN NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH‚ÄÔS MAKING PROVISION FOR HER WHEN HE HAD TO COME HERE, AND I BELIEVE HE ARRANGED TO PAY A CONSIDERABLE SUM, THREE HUNDRED ROUBLES A YEAR, IF NOT MORE, AS A PENSION FOR HER. IN SHORT IT WAS ALL A CAPRICE, A FANCY OF A MAN PREMATURELY WEARY ON HIS SIDE, PERHAPS‚ÄÎIT MAY EVEN HAVE BEEN, AS KIRILLOV SAYS, A NEW EXPERIMENT OF A BLAS√© MAN, WITH THE OBJECT OF FINDING OUT WHAT YOU CAN BRING A CRAZY CRIPPLE TO.‚ÄÙ (YOU PICKED OUT ON PURPOSE, HE SAID, THE LOWEST CREATURE, A CRIPPLE, FOREVER COVERED WITH DISGRACE AND BLOWS, KNOWING, TOO, THAT THIS CREATURE WAS DYING OF COMIC LOVE FOR YOU, AND SET TO WORK TO MYSTIFY HER COMPLETELY ON PURPOSE, SIMPLY TO SEE WHAT WOULD COME OF IT.) ‚ÄÚTHOUGH, HOW IS A MAN SO PARTICULARLY TO BLAME FOR THE FANCIES OF A CRAZY WOMAN, TO WHOM HE HAD HARDLY UTTERED TWO SENTENCES THE WHOLE TIME. THERE ARE THINGS, VARVARA PETROVNA, OF WHICH IT IS NOT ONLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK SENSIBLY, BUT IT‚ÄÔS EVEN NONSENSICAL TO BEGIN SPEAKING OF THEM AT ALL. WELL, ECCENTRICITY THEN, LET IT STAND AT THAT. ANYWAY, THERE‚ÄÔS NOTHING WORSE TO BE SAID THAN THAT; AND YET NOW THEY‚ÄÔVE MADE THIS SCANDAL OUT OF IT.‚Ä¶ I AM TO SOME EXTENT AWARE, VARVARA PETROVNA, OF WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE.‚ÄÙ

THE SPEAKER SUDDENLY BROKE OFF AND WAS TURNING TO LEBYADKIN. BUT VARVARA PETROVNA CHECKED HIM. SHE WAS IN A STATE OF EXTREME EXALTATION.

‚ÄÚHAVE YOU FINISHED?‚ÄÙ SHE ASKED.

‚ÄÚNOT YET; TO COMPLETE MY STORY I SHOULD HAVE TO ASK THIS GENTLEMAN ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS IF YOU‚ÄÔLL ALLOW ME ‚Ä¶ YOU‚ÄÔLL SEE THE POINT IN A MINUTE, VARVARA PETROVNA.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚENOUGH, AFTERWARDS, LEAVE IT FOR THE MOMENT I BEG YOU. OH, I WAS QUITE RIGHT TO LET YOU SPEAK!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND NOTE THIS, VARVARA PETROVNA,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SAID HASTILY. ‚ÄÚCOULD NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAVE EXPLAINED ALL THIS JUST NOW IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION, WHICH WAS PERHAPS TOO PEREMPTORY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, YES, IT WAS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND WASN‚ÄÔT I RIGHT IN SAYING THAT IN SOME CASES IT‚ÄÔS MUCH EASIER FOR A THIRD PERSON TO EXPLAIN THINGS THAN FOR THE PERSON INTERESTED?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, YES ‚Ä¶ BUT IN ONE THING YOU WERE MISTAKEN, AND, I SEE WITH REGRET, ARE STILL MISTAKEN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚREALLY, WHAT‚ÄÔS THAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU SEE.‚Ä¶ BUT WON‚ÄÔT YOU SIT DOWN, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, AS YOU PLEASE. I AM TIRED INDEED. THANK YOU.‚ÄÙ HE INSTANTLY MOVED UP AN EASY CHAIR AND TURNED IT SO THAT HE HAD VARVARA PETROVNA ON ONE SIDE AND PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA AT THE TABLE ON THE OTHER, WHILE HE FACED LEBYADKIN, FROM WHOM HE DID NOT TAKE HIS EYES FOR ONE MINUTE.

‚ÄÚYOU ARE MISTAKEN IN CALLING THIS ECCENTRICITY.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, IF IT‚ÄÔS ONLY THAT.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, NO, NO, WAIT A LITTLE,‚ÄÙ SAID VARVARA PETROVNA, WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY ABOUT TO SAY A GOOD DEAL AND TO SPEAK WITH ENTHUSIASM. AS SOON AS PYOTR STEPANOVITCH NOTICED IT, HE WAS ALL ATTENTION.

‚ÄÚNO, IT WAS SOMETHING HIGHER THAN ECCENTRICITY, AND I ASSURE YOU, SOMETHING SACRED EVEN! A PROUD MAN WHO HAS SUFFERED HUMILIATION EARLY IN LIFE AND REACHED THE STAGE OF ‚ÄÒMOCKERY‚ÄÔ AS YOU SO SUBTLY CALLED IT‚ÄÎPRINCE HARRY, IN FACT, TO USE THE CAPITAL NICKNAME STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH GAVE HIM THEN, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY CORRECT IF IT WERE NOT THAT HE IS MORE LIKE HAMLET, TO MY THINKING AT LEAST.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚET VOUS AVEZ RAISON,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH PRONOUNCED, IMPRESSIVELY AND WITH FEELING.

‚ÄÚTHANK YOU, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. I THANK YOU PARTICULARLY TOO FOR YOUR UNVARYING FAITH IN NICOLAS, IN THE LOFTINESS OF HIS SOUL AND OF HIS DESTINY. THAT FAITH YOU HAVE EVEN STRENGTHENED IN ME WHEN I WAS LOSING HEART.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCH√®RE, CH√®RE.‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS STEPPING FORWARD, WHEN HE CHECKED HIMSELF, REFLECTING THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO INTERRUPT.

‚ÄÚAND IF NICOLAS HAD ALWAYS HAD AT HIS SIDE‚ÄÙ (VARVARA PETROVNA ALMOST SHOUTED) ‚ÄÚA GENTLE HORATIO, GREAT IN HIS HUMILITY‚ÄÎANOTHER EXCELLENT EXPRESSION OF YOURS, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÎHE MIGHT LONG AGO HAVE BEEN SAVED FROM THE SAD AND ‚ÄÒSUDDEN DEMON OF IRONY,‚ÄÔ WHICH HAS TORMENTED HIM ALL HIS LIFE. (‚ÄÒTHE DEMON OF IRONY‚ÄÔ WAS A WONDERFUL EXPRESSION OF YOURS AGAIN, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.) BUT NICOLAS HAS NEVER HAD AN HORATIO OR AN OPHELIA. HE HAD NO ONE BUT HIS MOTHER, AND WHAT CAN A MOTHER DO ALONE, AND IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES? DO YOU KNOW, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, IT‚ÄÔS PERFECTLY COMPREHENSIBLE TO ME NOW THAT A BEING LIKE NICOLAS COULD BE FOUND EVEN IN SUCH FILTHY HAUNTS AS YOU HAVE DESCRIBED. I CAN SO CLEARLY PICTURE NOW THAT ‚ÄÒMOCKERY‚ÄÔ OF LIFE. (A WONDERFULLY SUBTLE EXPRESSION OF YOURS!) THAT INSATIABLE THIRST OF CONTRAST, THAT GLOOMY BACKGROUND AGAINST WHICH HE STANDS OUT LIKE A DIAMOND, TO USE YOUR COMPARISON AGAIN, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. AND THEN HE MEETS THERE A CREATURE ILL-TREATED BY EVERY ONE, CRIPPLED, HALF INSANE, AND AT THE SAME TIME PERHAPS FILLED WITH NOBLE FEELINGS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚH‚ÄÔM.‚Ä¶ YES, PERHAPS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND AFTER THAT YOU DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND THAT HE‚ÄÔS NOT LAUGHING AT HER LIKE EVERY ONE. OH, YOU PEOPLE! YOU CAN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND HIS DEFENDING HER FROM INSULT, TREATING HER WITH RESPECT ‚ÄÒLIKE A MARQUISE‚ÄÔ (THIS KIRILLOV MUST HAVE AN EXCEPTIONALLY DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF MEN, THOUGH HE DIDN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND NICOLAS). IT WAS JUST THIS CONTRAST, IF YOU LIKE, THAT LED TO THE TROUBLE. IF THE UNHAPPY CREATURE HAD BEEN IN DIFFERENT SURROUNDINGS, PERHAPS SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO ENTERTAIN SUCH A FRANTIC DELUSION. ONLY A WOMAN CAN UNDERSTAND IT, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, ONLY A WOMAN. HOW SORRY I AM THAT YOU ‚Ä¶ NOT THAT YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT A WOMAN, BUT THAT YOU CAN‚ÄÔT BE ONE JUST FOR THE MOMENT SO AS TO UNDERSTAND.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU MEAN IN THE SENSE THAT THE WORSE THINGS ARE THE BETTER IT IS. I UNDERSTAND, I UNDERSTAND, VARVARA PETROVNA. IT‚ÄÔS RATHER AS IT IS IN RELIGION; THE HARDER LIFE IS FOR A MAN OR THE MORE CRUSHED AND POOR THE PEOPLE ARE, THE MORE OBSTINATELY THEY DREAM OF COMPENSATION IN HEAVEN; AND IF A HUNDRED THOUSAND PRIESTS ARE AT WORK AT IT TOO, INFLAMING THEIR DELUSION, AND SPECULATING ON IT, THEN ‚Ä¶ I UNDERSTAND YOU, VARVARA PETROVNA, I ASSURE YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS NOT QUITE IT; BUT TELL ME, OUGHT NICOLAS TO HAVE LAUGHED AT HER AND HAVE TREATED HER AS THE OTHER CLERKS, IN ORDER TO EXTINGUISH THE DELUSION IN THIS UNHAPPY ORGANISM.‚ÄÙ (WHY VARVARA PETROVNA USED THE WORD ORGANISM I COULDN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND.) ‚ÄÚCAN YOU REALLY REFUSE TO RECOGNISE THE LOFTY COMPASSION, THE NOBLE TREMOR OF THE WHOLE ORGANISM WITH WHICH NICOLAS ANSWERED KIRILLOV: ‚ÄÒI DO NOT LAUGH AT HER.‚ÄÔ A NOBLE, SACRED ANSWER!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSUBLIME,‚ÄÙ MUTTERED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.

‚ÄÚAND OBSERVE, TOO, THAT HE IS BY NO MEANS SO RICH AS YOU SUPPOSE. THE MONEY IS MINE AND NOT HIS, AND HE WOULD TAKE NEXT TO NOTHING FROM ME THEN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI UNDERSTAND, I UNDERSTAND ALL THAT, VARVARA PETROVNA,‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WITH A MOVEMENT OF SOME IMPATIENCE.

‚ÄÚOH, IT‚ÄÔS MY CHARACTER! I RECOGNISE MYSELF IN NICOLAS. I RECOGNISE THAT YOUTHFULNESS, THAT LIABILITY TO VIOLENT, TEMPESTUOUS IMPULSES. AND IF WE EVER COME TO BE FRIENDS, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, AND, FOR MY PART, I SINCERELY HOPE WE MAY, ESPECIALLY AS I AM SO DEEPLY INDEBTED TO YOU, THEN, PERHAPS YOU‚ÄÔLL UNDERSTAND.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, I ASSURE YOU, I HOPE FOR IT TOO,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH MUTTERED JERKILY.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔLL UNDERSTAND THEN THE IMPULSE WHICH LEADS ONE IN THE BLINDNESS OF GENEROUS FEELING TO TAKE UP A MAN WHO IS UNWORTHY OF ONE IN EVERY RESPECT, A MAN WHO UTTERLY FAILS TO UNDERSTAND ONE, WHO IS READY TO TORTURE ONE AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY AND, IN CONTRADICTION TO EVERYTHING, TO EXALT SUCH A MAN INTO A SORT OF IDEAL, INTO A DREAM. TO CONCENTRATE IN HIM ALL ONE‚ÄÔS HOPES, TO BOW DOWN BEFORE HIM; TO LOVE HIM ALL ONE‚ÄÔS LIFE, ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT KNOWING WHY‚ÄÎPERHAPS JUST BECAUSE HE WAS UNWORTHY OF IT.‚Ä¶ OH, HOW I‚ÄÔVE SUFFERED ALL MY LIFE, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH!‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, WITH A LOOK OF SUFFERING ON HIS FACE, BEGAN TRYING TO CATCH MY EYE, BUT I TURNED AWAY IN TIME.

‚ÄÚ‚Ä¶ AND ONLY LATELY, ONLY LATELY‚ÄÎOH, HOW UNJUST I‚ÄÔVE BEEN TO NICOLAS! ‚Ä¶ YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE HOW THEY HAVE BEEN WORRYING ME ON ALL SIDES, ALL, ALL, ENEMIES, AND RASCALS, AND FRIENDS, FRIENDS PERHAPS MORE THAN ENEMIES. WHEN THE FIRST CONTEMPTIBLE ANONYMOUS LETTER WAS SENT TO ME, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, YOU‚ÄÔLL HARDLY BELIEVE IT, BUT I HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO TREAT ALL THIS WICKEDNESS WITH CONTEMPT.‚Ä¶ I SHALL NEVER, NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF FOR MY WEAKNESS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI HAD HEARD SOMETHING OF ANONYMOUS LETTERS HERE ALREADY,‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, GROWING SUDDENLY MORE LIVELY, ‚ÄÚAND I‚ÄÔLL FIND OUT THE WRITERS OF THEM, YOU MAY BE SURE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT YOU CAN‚ÄÔT IMAGINE THE INTRIGUES THAT HAVE BEEN GOT UP HERE. THEY HAVE EVEN BEEN PESTERING OUR POOR PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA, AND WHAT REASON CAN THEY HAVE FOR WORRYING HER? I WAS QUITE UNFAIR TO YOU TO-DAY PERHAPS, MY DEAR PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA,‚ÄÙ SHE ADDED IN A GENEROUS IMPULSE OF KINDLINESS, THOUGH NOT WITHOUT A CERTAIN TRIUMPHANT IRONY.

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT SAY ANY MORE, MY DEAR,‚ÄÙ THE OTHER LADY MUTTERED RELUCTANTLY. ‚ÄÚTO MY THINKING WE‚ÄÔD BETTER MAKE AN END OF ALL THIS; TOO MUCH HAS BEEN SAID.‚ÄÙ

AND AGAIN SHE LOOKED TIMIDLY TOWARDS LIZA, BUT THE LATTER WAS LOOKING AT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH.

‚ÄÚAND I INTEND NOW TO ADOPT THIS POOR UNHAPPY CREATURE, THIS INSANE WOMAN WHO HAS LOST EVERYTHING AND KEPT ONLY HER HEART,‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA EXCLAIMED SUDDENLY. ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS A SACRED DUTY I INTEND TO CARRY OUT. I TAKE HER UNDER MY PROTECTION FROM THIS DAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND THAT WILL BE A VERY GOOD THING IN ONE WAY,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH CRIED, GROWING QUITE EAGER AGAIN. ‚ÄÚEXCUSE ME, I DID NOT FINISH JUST NOW. IT‚ÄÔS JUST THE CARE OF HER I WANT TO SPEAK OF. WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT, THAT AS SOON AS NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAD GONE (I‚ÄÔM BEGINNING FROM WHERE I LEFT OFF, VARVARA PETROVNA), THIS GENTLEMAN HERE, THIS MR. LEBYADKIN, INSTANTLY IMAGINED HE HAD THE RIGHT TO DISPOSE OF THE WHOLE PENSION THAT WAS PROVIDED FOR HIS SISTER. AND HE DID DISPOSE OF IT. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT HAD BEEN ARRANGED BY NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH AT THAT TIME. BUT A YEAR LATER, WHEN HE LEARNED FROM ABROAD WHAT HAD HAPPENED, HE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS. AGAIN, I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW THE DETAILS; HE‚ÄÔLL TELL YOU THEM HIMSELF. I ONLY KNOW THAT THE INTERESTING YOUNG PERSON WAS PLACED SOMEWHERE IN A REMOTE NUNNERY, IN VERY COMFORTABLE SURROUNDINGS, BUT UNDER FRIENDLY SUPERINTENDENCE‚ÄÎYOU UNDERSTAND? BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK MR. LEBYADKIN MADE UP HIS MIND TO DO? HE EXERTED HIMSELF TO THE UTMOST, TO BEGIN WITH, TO FIND WHERE HIS SOURCE OF INCOME, THAT IS HIS SISTER, WAS HIDDEN. ONLY LATELY HE ATTAINED HIS OBJECT, TOOK HER FROM THE NUNNERY, ASSERTING SOME CLAIM TO HER, AND BROUGHT HER STRAIGHT HERE. HERE HE DOESN‚ÄÔT FEED HER PROPERLY, BEATS HER, AND BULLIES HER. AS SOON AS BY SOME MEANS HE GETS A CONSIDERABLE SUM FROM NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, HE DOES NOTHING BUT GET DRUNK, AND INSTEAD OF GRATITUDE ENDS BY IMPUDENTLY DEFYING NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, MAKING SENSELESS DEMANDS, THREATENING HIM WITH PROCEEDINGS IF THE PENSION IS NOT PAID STRAIGHT INTO HIS HANDS. SO HE TAKES WHAT IS A VOLUNTARY GIFT FROM NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH AS A TAX‚ÄÎCAN YOU IMAGINE IT? MR. LEBYADKIN, IS THAT ALL TRUE THAT I HAVE SAID JUST NOW?‚ÄÙ

THE CAPTAIN, WHO HAD TILL THAT MOMENT STOOD IN SILENCE LOOKING DOWN, TOOK TWO RAPID STEPS FORWARD AND TURNED CRIMSON.

‚ÄÚPYOTR STEPANOVITCH, YOU‚ÄÔVE TREATED ME CRUELLY,‚ÄÙ HE BROUGHT OUT ABRUPTLY.

‚ÄÚWHY CRUELLY? HOW? BUT ALLOW US TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION OF CRUELTY OR GENTLENESS LATER ON. NOW ANSWER MY FIRST QUESTION; IS IT TRUE ALL THAT I HAVE SAID OR NOT? IF YOU CONSIDER IT‚ÄÔS FALSE YOU ARE AT LIBERTY TO GIVE YOUR OWN VERSION AT ONCE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI ‚Ä¶ YOU KNOW YOURSELF, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH,‚ÄÙ THE CAPTAIN MUTTERED, BUT HE COULD NOT GO ON AND RELAPSED INTO SILENCE. IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS SITTING IN AN EASY CHAIR WITH ONE LEG CROSSED OVER THE OTHER, WHILE THE CAPTAIN STOOD BEFORE HIM IN THE MOST RESPECTFUL ATTITUDE.

LEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS HESITATION SEEMED TO ANNOY PYOTR STEPANOVITCH; A SPASM OF ANGER DISTORTED HIS FACE.

‚ÄÚTHEN YOU HAVE A STATEMENT YOU WANT TO MAKE?‚ÄÙ HE SAID, LOOKING SUBTLY AT THE CAPTAIN. ‚ÄÚKINDLY SPEAK. WE‚ÄÔRE WAITING FOR YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU KNOW YOURSELF PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, THAT I CAN‚ÄÔT SAY ANYTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW IT. IT‚ÄÔS THE FIRST TIME I‚ÄÔVE HEARD IT. WHY CAN‚ÄÔT YOU SPEAK?‚ÄÙ

THE CAPTAIN WAS SILENT, WITH HIS EYES ON THE GROUND.

‚ÄÚALLOW ME TO GO, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH,‚ÄÙ HE BROUGHT OUT RESOLUTELY.

‚ÄÚNO, NOT TILL YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION: IS IT ALL TRUE THAT I‚ÄÔVE SAID?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT IS TRUE,‚ÄÙ LEBYADKIN BROUGHT OUT IN A HOLLOW VOICE, LOOKING AT HIS TORMENTOR. DROPS OF PERSPIRATION STOOD OUT ON HIS FOREHEAD.

‚ÄÚIS IT ALL TRUE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS ALL TRUE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHAVE YOU NOTHING TO ADD OR TO OBSERVE? IF YOU THINK THAT WE‚ÄÔVE BEEN UNJUST, SAY SO; PROTEST, STATE YOUR GRIEVANCE ALOUD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, I THINK NOTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDID YOU THREATEN NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH LATELY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT WAS ‚Ä¶ IT WAS MORE DRINK THAN ANYTHING, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH.‚ÄÙ HE SUDDENLY RAISED HIS HEAD. ‚ÄÚIF FAMILY HONOUR AND UNDESERVED DISGRACE CRY OUT AMONG MEN THEN‚ÄÎTHEN IS A MAN TO BLAME?‚ÄÙ HE ROARED SUDDENLY, FORGETTING HIMSELF AS BEFORE.

‚ÄÚARE YOU SOBER NOW, MR. LEBYADKIN?‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH LOOKED AT HIM PENETRATINGLY.

‚ÄÚI AM ‚Ä¶ SOBER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU MEAN BY FAMILY HONOUR AND UNDESERVED DISGRACE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DIDN‚ÄÔT MEAN ANYBODY, ANYBODY AT ALL. I MEANT MYSELF,‚ÄÙ THE CAPTAIN SAID, COLLAPSING AGAIN.

‚ÄÚYOU SEEM TO BE VERY MUCH OFFENDED BY WHAT I‚ÄÔVE SAID ABOUT YOU AND YOUR CONDUCT? YOU ARE VERY IRRITABLE, MR. LEBYADKIN. BUT LET ME TELL YOU I‚ÄÔVE HARDLY BEGUN YET WHAT I‚ÄÔVE GOT TO SAY ABOUT YOUR CONDUCT, IN ITS REAL SENSE. I‚ÄÔLL BEGIN TO DISCUSS YOUR CONDUCT IN ITS REAL SENSE. I SHALL BEGIN, THAT MAY VERY WELL HAPPEN, BUT SO FAR I‚ÄÔVE NOT BEGUN, IN A REAL SENSE.‚ÄÙ

LEBYADKIN STARTED AND STARED WILDLY AT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH.

‚ÄÚPYOTR STEPANOVITCH, I AM JUST BEGINNING TO WAKE UP.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚH‚ÄÔM! AND IT‚ÄÔS I WHO HAVE WAKED YOU UP?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, IT‚ÄÔS YOU WHO HAVE WAKED ME, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH; AND I‚ÄÔVE BEEN ASLEEP FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS WITH A STORM-CLOUD HANGING OVER ME. MAY I WITHDRAW AT LAST, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOW YOU MAY, UNLESS VARVARA PETROVNA THINKS IT NECESSARY ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

BUT THE LATTER DISMISSED HIM WITH A WAVE OF HER HAND.

THE CAPTAIN BOWED, TOOK TWO STEPS TOWARDS THE DOOR, STOPPED SUDDENLY, LAID HIS HAND ON HIS HEART, TRIED TO SAY SOMETHING, DID NOT SAY IT, AND WAS MOVING QUICKLY AWAY. BUT IN THE DOORWAY HE CAME FACE TO FACE WITH NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH; THE LATTER STOOD ASIDE. THE CAPTAIN SHRANK INTO HIMSELF, AS IT WERE, BEFORE HIM, AND STOOD AS THOUGH FROZEN TO THE SPOT, HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIM LIKE A RABBIT BEFORE A BOA-CONSTRICTOR. AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAVED HIM ASIDE WITH A SLIGHT MOTION OF HIS HAND, AND WALKED INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM.

VII

HE WAS CHEERFUL AND SERENE. PERHAPS SOMETHING VERY PLEASANT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM, OF WHICH WE KNEW NOTHING AS YET; BUT HE SEEMED PARTICULARLY CONTENTED.

‚ÄÚDO YOU FORGIVE ME, NICOLAS?‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA HASTENED TO SAY, AND GOT UP SUDDENLY TO MEET HIM.

BUT NICOLAS POSITIVELY LAUGHED.

‚ÄÚJUST AS I THOUGHT,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, GOOD-HUMOUREDLY AND JESTINGLY. ‚ÄÚI SEE YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT ALREADY. WHEN I HAD GONE FROM HERE I REFLECTED IN THE CARRIAGE THAT I OUGHT AT LEAST TO HAVE TOLD YOU THE STORY INSTEAD OF GOING OFF LIKE THAT. BUT WHEN I REMEMBERED THAT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS STILL HERE, I THOUGHT NO MORE OF IT.‚ÄÙ

AS HE SPOKE HE TOOK A CURSORY LOOK ROUND.

‚ÄÚPYOTR STEPANOVITCH TOLD US AN OLD PETERSBURG EPISODE IN THE LIFE OF A QUEER FELLOW,‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA REJOINED ENTHUSIASTICALLY‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚA MAD AND CAPRICIOUS FELLOW, THOUGH ALWAYS LOFTY IN HIS FEELINGS, ALWAYS CHIVALROUS AND NOBLE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCHIVALROUS? YOU DON‚ÄÔT MEAN TO SAY IT‚ÄÔS COME TO THAT,‚ÄÙ LAUGHED NICOLAS. ‚ÄÚHOWEVER, I‚ÄÔM VERY GRATEFUL TO PYOTR STEPANOVITCH FOR BEING IN SUCH A HURRY THIS TIME.‚ÄÙ HE EXCHANGED A RAPID GLANCE WITH THE LATTER. ‚ÄÚYOU MUST KNOW, MAMAN, THAT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH IS THE UNIVERSAL PEACEMAKER; THAT‚ÄÔS HIS PART IN LIFE, HIS WEAKNESS, HIS HOBBY, AND I PARTICULARLY RECOMMEND HIM TO YOU FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW. I CAN GUESS WHAT A YARN HE‚ÄÔS BEEN SPINNING. HE‚ÄÔS A GREAT HAND AT SPINNING THEM; HE HAS A PERFECT RECORD-OFFICE IN HIS HEAD. HE‚ÄÔS SUCH A REALIST, YOU KNOW, THAT HE CAN‚ÄÔT TELL A LIE, AND PREFERS TRUTHFULNESS TO EFFECT ‚Ä¶ EXCEPT, OF COURSE, IN SPECIAL CASES WHEN EFFECT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN TRUTH.‚ÄÙ (AS HE SAID THIS HE WAS STILL LOOKING ABOUT HIM.) ‚ÄÚSO, YOU SEE CLEARLY, MAMAN, THAT IT‚ÄÔS NOT FOR YOU TO ASK MY FORGIVENESS, AND IF THERE‚ÄÔS ANY CRAZINESS ABOUT THIS AFFAIR IT‚ÄÔS MY FAULT, AND IT PROVES THAT, WHEN ALL‚ÄÔS SAID AND DONE, I REALLY AM MAD.‚Ä¶ I MUST KEEP UP MY CHARACTER HERE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

THEN HE TENDERLY EMBRACED HIS MOTHER.

‚ÄÚIN ANY CASE THE SUBJECT HAS BEEN FULLY DISCUSSED AND IS DONE WITH,‚ÄÙ HE ADDED, AND THERE WAS A RATHER DRY AND RESOLUTE NOTE IN HIS VOICE. VARVARA PETROVNA UNDERSTOOD THAT NOTE, BUT HER EXALTATION WAS NOT DAMPED, QUITE THE CONTRARY.

‚ÄÚI DIDN‚ÄÔT EXPECT YOU FOR ANOTHER MONTH, NICOLAS!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO YOU, MAMAN, OF COURSE, BUT NOW ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

AND HE WENT TOWARDS PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA.

BUT SHE SCARCELY TURNED HER HEAD TOWARDS HIM, THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED BY HIS FIRST APPEARANCE. NOW SHE HAD FRESH ANXIETIES TO THINK OF; AT THE MOMENT THE CAPTAIN HAD STUMBLED UPON NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH AS HE WAS GOING OUT, LIZA HAD SUDDENLY BEGUN LAUGHING‚ÄÎAT FIRST QUIETLY AND INTERMITTENTLY, BUT HER LAUGHTER GREW MORE AND MORE VIOLENT, LOUDER AND MORE CONSPICUOUS. SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON, IN STRIKING CONTRAST WITH HER GLOOMY EXPRESSION JUST BEFORE.

WHILE NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS TALKING TO VARVARA PETROVNA, SHE HAD TWICE BECKONED TO MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH AS THOUGH SHE WANTED TO WHISPER SOMETHING TO HIM; BUT AS SOON AS THE YOUNG MAN BENT DOWN TO HER, SHE INSTANTLY BURST INTO LAUGHTER; SO THAT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH IT WAS AT POOR MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH THAT SHE WAS LAUGHING. SHE EVIDENTLY TRIED TO CONTROL HERSELF, HOWEVER, AND PUT HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH TURNED TO GREET HER WITH A MOST INNOCENT AND OPEN-HEARTED AIR.

‚ÄÚPLEASE EXCUSE ME,‚ÄÙ SHE RESPONDED, SPEAKING QUICKLY. ‚ÄÚYOU ‚Ä¶ YOU‚ÄÔVE SEEN MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH OF COURSE.‚Ä¶ MY GOODNESS, HOW INEXCUSABLY TALL YOU ARE, MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH!‚ÄÙ

AND LAUGHTER AGAIN, MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH WAS TALL, BUT BY NO MEANS INEXCUSABLY SO.

‚ÄÚHAVE ‚Ä¶ YOU BEEN HERE LONG?‚ÄÙ SHE MUTTERED, RESTRAINING HERSELF AGAIN, GENUINELY EMBARRASSED THOUGH HER EYES WERE SHINING.

‚ÄÚMORE THAN TWO HOURS,‚ÄÙ ANSWERED NICOLAS, LOOKING AT HER INTENTLY. I MAY REMARK THAT HE WAS EXCEPTIONALLY RESERVED AND COURTEOUS, BUT THAT APART FROM HIS COURTESY HIS EXPRESSION WAS UTTERLY INDIFFERENT, EVEN LISTLESS.

‚ÄÚAND WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO STAY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHERE.‚ÄÙ

VARVARA PETROVNA, TOO, WAS WATCHING LIZA, BUT SHE WAS SUDDENLY STRUCK BY AN IDEA.

‚ÄÚWHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL THIS TIME, NICOLAS, MORE THAN TWO HOURS?‚ÄÙ SHE SAID, GOING UP TO HIM. ‚ÄÚTHE TRAIN COMES IN AT TEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI FIRST TOOK PYOTR STEPANOVITCH TO KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS. I CAME ACROSS PYOTR STEPANOVITCH AT MATVEYEV (THREE STATIONS AWAY), AND WE TRAVELLED TOGETHER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI HAD BEEN WAITING AT MATVEYEV SINCE SUNRISE,‚ÄÙ PUT IN PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. ‚ÄÚTHE LAST CARRIAGES OF OUR TRAIN RAN OFF THE RAILS IN THE NIGHT, AND WE NEARLY HAD OUR LEGS BROKEN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOUR LEGS BROKEN!‚ÄÙ CRIED LIZA. ‚ÄÚMAMAN, MAMAN, YOU AND I MEANT TO GO TO MATVEYEV LAST WEEK, WE SHOULD HAVE BROKEN OUR LEGS TOO!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHEAVEN HAVE MERCY ON US!‚ÄÙ CRIED PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA, CROSSING HERSELF.

‚ÄÚMAMAN, MAMAN, DEAR MAMAN, YOU MUSTN‚ÄÔT BE FRIGHTENED IF I BREAK BOTH MY LEGS. IT MAY SO EASILY HAPPEN TO ME; YOU SAY YOURSELF THAT I RIDE SO RECKLESSLY EVERY DAY. MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, WILL YOU GO ABOUT WITH ME WHEN I‚ÄÔM LAME?‚ÄÙ SHE BEGAN GIGGLING AGAIN. ‚ÄÚIF IT DOES HAPPEN I WON‚ÄÔT LET ANYONE TAKE ME ABOUT BUT YOU, YOU CAN RECKON ON THAT.‚Ä¶ WELL, SUPPOSE I BREAK ONLY ONE LEG. COME, BE POLITE, SAY YOU‚ÄÔLL THINK IT A PLEASURE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚA PLEASURE TO BE CRIPPLED?‚ÄÙ SAID MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, FROWNING GRAVELY.

‚ÄÚBUT THEN YOU‚ÄÔLL LEAD ME ABOUT, ONLY YOU AND NO ONE ELSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEVEN THEN IT‚ÄÔLL BE YOU LEADING ME ABOUT, LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA,‚ÄÙ MURMURED MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, EVEN MORE GRAVELY.

‚ÄÚWHY, HE‚ÄÔS TRYING TO MAKE A JOKE!‚ÄÙ CRIED LIZA, ALMOST IN DISMAY. ‚ÄÚMAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, DON‚ÄÔT YOU EVER DARE TAKE TO THAT! BUT WHAT AN EGOIST YOU ARE! I AM CERTAIN THAT, TO YOUR CREDIT, YOU‚ÄÔRE SLANDERING YOURSELF. IT WILL BE QUITE THE CONTRARY; FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT YOU‚ÄÔLL ASSURE ME THAT I HAVE BECOME MORE CHARMING FOR HAVING LOST MY LEG. THERE‚ÄÔS ONE INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTY‚ÄÎYOU‚ÄÔRE SO FEARFULLY TALL, AND WHEN I‚ÄÔVE LOST MY LEG I SHALL BE SO VERY TINY. HOW WILL YOU BE ABLE TO TAKE ME ON YOUR ARM; WE SHALL LOOK A STRANGE COUPLE!‚ÄÙ

AND SHE LAUGHED HYSTERICALLY. HER JESTS AND INSINUATIONS WERE FEEBLE, BUT SHE WAS NOT CAPABLE OF CONSIDERING THE EFFECT SHE WAS PRODUCING.

‚ÄÚHYSTERICS!‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WHISPERED TO ME. ‚ÄÚA GLASS OF WATER, MAKE HASTE!‚ÄÙ

HE WAS RIGHT. A MINUTE LATER EVERY ONE WAS FUSSING ABOUT, WATER WAS BROUGHT. LIZA EMBRACED HER MOTHER, KISSED HER WARMLY, WEPT ON HER SHOULDER, THEN DRAWING BACK AND LOOKING HER IN THE FACE SHE FELL TO LAUGHING AGAIN. THE MOTHER TOO BEGAN WHIMPERING. VARVARA PETROVNA MADE HASTE TO CARRY THEM BOTH OFF TO HER OWN ROOMS, GOING OUT BY THE SAME DOOR BY WHICH DARYA PAVLOVNA HAD COME TO US. BUT THEY WERE NOT AWAY LONG, NOT MORE THAN FOUR MINUTES.

I AM TRYING TO REMEMBER NOW EVERY DETAIL OF THESE LAST MOMENTS OF THAT MEMORABLE MORNING. I REMEMBER THAT WHEN WE WERE LEFT WITHOUT THE LADIES (EXCEPT DARYA PAVLOVNA, WHO HAD NOT MOVED FROM HER SEAT), NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH MADE THE ROUND, GREETING US ALL EXCEPT SHATOV, WHO STILL SAT IN HIS CORNER, HIS HEAD MORE BOWED THAN EVER. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS BEGINNING SOMETHING VERY WITTY TO NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, BUT THE LATTER TURNED AWAY HURRIEDLY TO DARYA PAVLOVNA. BUT BEFORE HE REACHED HER, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH CAUGHT HIM AND DREW HIM AWAY, ALMOST VIOLENTLY, TOWARDS THE WINDOW, WHERE HE WHISPERED SOMETHING QUICKLY TO HIM, APPARENTLY SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO JUDGE BY THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE AND THE GESTURES THAT ACCOMPANIED THE WHISPER. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH LISTENED INATTENTIVELY AND LISTLESSLY WITH HIS OFFICIAL SMILE, AND AT LAST EVEN IMPATIENTLY, AND SEEMED ALL THE TIME ON THE POINT OF BREAKING AWAY. HE MOVED AWAY FROM THE WINDOW JUST AS THE LADIES CAME BACK. VARVARA PETROVNA MADE LIZA SIT DOWN IN THE SAME SEAT AS BEFORE, DECLARING THAT SHE MUST WAIT AND REST ANOTHER TEN MINUTES; AND THAT THE FRESH AIR WOULD PERHAPS BE TOO MUCH FOR HER NERVES AT ONCE. SHE WAS LOOKING AFTER LIZA WITH GREAT DEVOTION, AND SAT DOWN BESIDE HER. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, NOW DISENGAGED, SKIPPED UP TO THEM AT ONCE, AND BROKE INTO A RAPID AND LIVELY FLOW OF CONVERSATION. AT THAT POINT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH AT LAST WENT UP TO DARYA PAVLOVNA WITH HIS LEISURELY STEP. DASHA BEGAN STIRRING UNEASILY AT HIS APPROACH, AND JUMPED UP QUICKLY IN EVIDENT EMBARRASSMENT, FLUSHING ALL OVER HER FACE.

‚ÄÚI BELIEVE ONE MAY CONGRATULATE YOU ‚Ä¶ OR IS IT TOO SOON?‚ÄÙ HE BROUGHT OUT WITH A PECULIAR LINE IN HIS FACE.

DASHA MADE HIM SOME ANSWER, BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO CATCH IT.

‚ÄÚFORGIVE MY INDISCRETION,‚ÄÙ HE ADDED, RAISING HIS VOICE, ‚ÄÚBUT YOU KNOW I WAS EXPRESSLY INFORMED. DID YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, I KNOW THAT YOU WERE EXPRESSLY INFORMED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT I HOPE I HAVE NOT DONE ANY HARM BY MY CONGRATULATIONS,‚ÄÙ HE LAUGHED. ‚ÄÚAND IF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT, WHAT‚ÄÔS THE CONGRATULATION ABOUT?‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SUDDENLY SKIPPED UP TO THEM. ‚ÄÚWHAT ARE YOU BEING CONGRATULATED ABOUT, DARYA PAVLOVNA? BAH! SURELY THAT‚ÄÔS NOT IT? YOUR BLUSH PROVES I‚ÄÔVE GUESSED RIGHT. AND INDEED, WHAT ELSE DOES ONE CONGRATULATE OUR CHARMING AND VIRTUOUS YOUNG LADIES ON? AND WHAT CONGRATULATIONS MAKE THEM BLUSH MOST READILY? WELL, ACCEPT MINE TOO, THEN, IF I‚ÄÔVE GUESSED RIGHT! AND PAY UP. DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE IN SWITZERLAND YOU BET YOU‚ÄÔD NEVER BE MARRIED.‚Ä¶ OH, YES, APROPOS OF SWITZERLAND‚ÄÎWHAT AM I THINKING ABOUT? ONLY FANCY, THAT‚ÄÔS HALF WHAT I CAME ABOUT, AND I WAS ALMOST FORGETTING IT. TELL ME,‚ÄÙ HE TURNED QUICKLY TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, ‚ÄÚWHEN ARE YOU GOING TO SWITZERLAND?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI ‚Ä¶ TO SWITZERLAND?‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH REPLIED, WONDERING AND CONFUSED.

‚ÄÚWHAT? AREN‚ÄÔT YOU GOING? WHY YOU‚ÄÔRE GETTING MARRIED, TOO, YOU WROTE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPIERRE!‚ÄÙ CRIED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.

‚ÄÚWELL, WHY PIERRE?‚Ä¶ YOU SEE, IF THAT‚ÄÔLL PLEASE YOU, I‚ÄÔVE FLOWN HERE TO ANNOUNCE THAT I‚ÄÔM NOT AT ALL AGAINST IT, SINCE YOU WERE SET ON HAVING MY OPINION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE; AND IF, INDEED,‚ÄÙ HE PATTERED ON, ‚ÄÚYOU WANT TO ‚ÄÒBE SAVED,‚ÄÔ AS YOU WROTE, BESEECHING MY HELP IN THE SAME LETTER, I AM AT YOUR SERVICE AGAIN. IS IT TRUE THAT HE IS GOING TO BE MARRIED, VARVARA PETROVNA?‚ÄÙ HE TURNED QUICKLY TO HER. ‚ÄÚI HOPE I‚ÄÔM NOT BEING INDISCREET; HE WRITES HIMSELF THAT THE WHOLE TOWN KNOWS IT AND EVERY ONE‚ÄÔS CONGRATULATING HIM, SO THAT, TO AVOID IT HE ONLY GOES OUT AT NIGHT. I‚ÄÔVE GOT HIS LETTERS IN MY POCKET. BUT WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT, VARVARA PETROVNA, I CAN‚ÄÔT MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF IT? JUST TELL ME ONE THING, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, ARE YOU TO BE CONGRATULATED OR ARE YOU TO BE ‚ÄÒSAVED‚ÄÔ? YOU WOULDN‚ÄÔT BELIEVE IT; IN ONE LINE HE‚ÄÔS DESPAIRING AND IN THE NEXT HE‚ÄÔS MOST JOYFUL. TO BEGIN WITH HE BEGS MY FORGIVENESS; WELL, OF COURSE, THAT‚ÄÔS THEIR WAY ‚Ä¶ THOUGH IT MUST BE SAID; FANCY, THE MAN‚ÄÔS ONLY SEEN ME TWICE IN HIS LIFE AND THEN BY ACCIDENT. AND SUDDENLY NOW, WHEN HE‚ÄÔS GOING TO BE MARRIED FOR THE THIRD TIME, HE IMAGINES THAT THIS IS A BREACH OF SOME SORT OF PARENTAL DUTY TO ME, AND ENTREATS ME A THOUSAND MILES AWAY NOT TO BE ANGRY AND TO ALLOW HIM TO. PLEASE DON‚ÄÔT BE HURT, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. IT‚ÄÔS CHARACTERISTIC OF YOUR GENERATION, I TAKE A BROAD VIEW OF IT, AND DON‚ÄÔT BLAME YOU. AND LET‚ÄÔS ADMIT IT DOES YOU HONOUR AND ALL THE REST. BUT THE POINT IS AGAIN THAT I DON‚ÄÔT SEE THE POINT OF IT. THERE‚ÄÔS SOMETHING ABOUT SOME SORT OF ‚ÄÒSINS IN SWITZERLAND.‚ÄÔ ‚ÄÒI‚ÄÔM GETTING MARRIED,‚ÄÔ HE SAYS, ‚ÄÒFOR MY SINS OR ON ACCOUNT OF THE ‚ÄÒSINS‚ÄÔ OF ANOTHER,‚ÄÔ OR WHATEVER IT IS‚ÄÎ‚ÄÒSINS‚ÄÔ ANYWAY. ‚ÄÒTHE GIRL,‚ÄÔ SAYS HE, ‚ÄÒIS A PEARL AND A DIAMOND,‚ÄÔ AND, WELL, OF COURSE, HE‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÒUNWORTHY OF HER‚ÄÔ; IT‚ÄÔS THEIR WAY OF TALKING; BUT ON ACCOUNT OF SOME SINS OR CIRCUMSTANCES ‚ÄÒHE IS OBLIGED TO LEAD HER TO THE ALTAR, AND GO TO SWITZERLAND, AND THEREFORE ABANDON EVERYTHING AND FLY TO SAVE ME.‚ÄÔ DO YOU UNDERSTAND ANYTHING OF ALL THAT? HOWEVER ‚Ä¶ HOWEVER, I NOTICE FROM THE EXPRESSION OF YOUR FACES‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎ(HE TURNED ABOUT WITH THE LETTER IN HIS HAND LOOKING WITH AN INNOCENT SMILE INTO THE FACES OF THE COMPANY)‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚTHAT, AS USUAL, I SEEM TO HAVE PUT MY FOOT IN IT THROUGH MY STUPID WAY OF BEING OPEN, OR, AS NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SAYS, ‚ÄÒBEING IN A HURRY.‚ÄÔ I THOUGHT, OF COURSE, THAT WE WERE ALL FRIENDS HERE, THAT IS, YOUR FRIENDS, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, YOUR FRIENDS. I AM REALLY A STRANGER, AND I SEE ‚Ä¶ AND I SEE THAT YOU ALL KNOW SOMETHING, AND THAT JUST THAT SOMETHING I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW.‚ÄÙ HE STILL WENT ON LOOKING ABOUT HIM.

‚ÄÚSO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WROTE TO YOU THAT HE WAS GETTING MARRIED FOR THE ‚ÄÒSINS OF ANOTHER COMMITTED IN SWITZERLAND,‚ÄÔ AND THAT YOU WERE TO FLY HERE ‚ÄÒTO SAVE HIM,‚ÄÔ IN THOSE VERY WORDS?‚ÄÙ SAID VARVARA PETROVNA, ADDRESSING HIM SUDDENLY. HER FACE WAS YELLOW AND DISTORTED, AND HER LIPS WERE TWITCHING.

‚ÄÚWELL, YOU SEE, IF THERE‚ÄÔS ANYTHING I‚ÄÔVE NOT UNDERSTOOD,‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, AS THOUGH IN ALARM, TALKING MORE QUICKLY THAN EVER, ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS HIS FAULT, OF COURSE, FOR WRITING LIKE THAT. HERE‚ÄÔS THE LETTER. YOU KNOW, VARVARA PETROVNA, HIS LETTERS ARE ENDLESS AND INCESSANT, AND, YOU KNOW, FOR THE LAST TWO OR THREE MONTHS THERE HAS BEEN LETTER UPON LETTER, TILL, I MUST OWN, AT LAST I SOMETIMES DIDN‚ÄÔT READ THEM THROUGH. FORGIVE ME, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, FOR MY FOOLISH CONFESSION, BUT YOU MUST ADMIT, PLEASE, THAT, THOUGH YOU ADDRESSED THEM TO ME, YOU WROTE THEM MORE FOR POSTERITY, SO THAT YOU REALLY CAN‚ÄÔT MIND.‚Ä¶ COME, COME, DON‚ÄÔT BE OFFENDED; WE‚ÄÔRE FRIENDS, ANYWAY. BUT THIS LETTER, VARVARA PETROVNA, THIS LETTER, I DID READ THROUGH. THESE ‚ÄÒSINS‚ÄÔ‚ÄÎTHESE ‚ÄÒSINS OF ANOTHER‚ÄÔ‚ÄÎARE PROBABLY SOME LITTLE SINS OF OUR OWN, AND I DON‚ÄÔT MIND BETTING VERY INNOCENT ONES, THOUGH THEY HAVE SUDDENLY MADE US TAKE A FANCY TO WORK UP A TERRIBLE STORY, WITH A GLAMOUR OF THE HEROIC ABOUT IT; AND IT‚ÄÔS JUST FOR THE SAKE OF THAT GLAMOUR WE‚ÄÔVE GOT IT UP. YOU SEE THERE‚ÄÔS SOMETHING A LITTLE LAME ABOUT OUR ACCOUNTS‚ÄÎIT MUST BE CONFESSED, IN THE END. WE‚ÄÔVE A GREAT WEAKNESS FOR CARDS, YOU KNOW.‚Ä¶ BUT THIS IS UNNECESSARY, QUITE UNNECESSARY, I‚ÄÔM SORRY, I CHATTER TOO MUCH. BUT UPON MY WORD, VARVARA PETROVNA, HE GAVE ME A FRIGHT, AND I REALLY WAS HALF PREPARED TO SAVE HIM. HE REALLY MADE ME FEEL ASHAMED. DID HE EXPECT ME TO HOLD A KNIFE TO HIS THROAT, OR WHAT? AM I SUCH A MERCILESS CREDITOR? HE WRITES SOMETHING HERE OF A DOWRY.‚Ä¶ BUT ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO GET MARRIED, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH? THAT WOULD BE JUST LIKE YOU, TO SAY A LOT FOR THE SAKE OF TALKING. ACH, VARVARA PETROVNA, I‚ÄÔM SURE YOU MUST BE BLAMING ME NOW, AND JUST FOR MY WAY OF TALKING TOO.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚON THE CONTRARY, ON THE CONTRARY, I SEE THAT YOU ARE DRIVEN OUT OF ALL PATIENCE, AND, NO DOUBT YOU HAVE HAD GOOD REASON,‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA ANSWERED SPITEFULLY. SHE HAD LISTENED WITH SPITEFUL ENJOYMENT TO ALL THE ‚ÄÚCANDID OUTBURSTS‚ÄÙ OF PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY PLAYING A PART (WHAT PART I DID NOT KNOW THEN, BUT IT WAS UNMISTAKABLE, AND OVER-ACTED INDEED).

‚ÄÚON THE CONTRARY,‚ÄÙ SHE WENT ON, ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM ONLY TOO GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR SPEAKING; BUT FOR YOU I MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWN OF IT. MY EYES ARE OPENED FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR TWENTY YEARS. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, YOU SAID JUST NOW THAT YOU HAD BEEN EXPRESSLY INFORMED; SURELY STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HASN‚ÄÔT WRITTEN TO YOU IN THE SAME STYLE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DID GET A VERY HARMLESS AND ‚Ä¶ AND ‚Ä¶ VERY GENEROUS LETTER FROM HIM.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU HESITATE, YOU PICK OUT YOUR WORDS. THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH! STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, I REQUEST A GREAT FAVOUR FROM YOU.‚ÄÙ SHE SUDDENLY TURNED TO HIM WITH FLASHING EYES. ‚ÄÚKINDLY LEAVE US AT ONCE, AND NEVER SET FOOT IN MY HOUSE AGAIN.‚ÄÙ

I MUST BEG THE READER TO REMEMBER HER RECENT ‚ÄÚEXALTATION,‚ÄÙ WHICH HAD NOT YET PASSED. IT‚ÄÔS TRUE THAT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS TERRIBLY TO BLAME! BUT WHAT WAS A COMPLETE SURPRISE TO ME THEN WAS THE WONDERFUL DIGNITY OF HIS BEARING UNDER HIS SON‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚACCUSATION,‚ÄÙ WHICH HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF INTERRUPTING, AND BEFORE VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚDENUNCIATION.‚ÄÙ HOW DID HE COME BY SUCH SPIRIT? I ONLY FOUND OUT ONE THING, THAT HE HAD CERTAINLY BEEN DEEPLY WOUNDED AT HIS FIRST MEETING WITH PETRUSHA, BY THE WAY HE HAD EMBRACED HIM. IT WAS A DEEP AND GENUINE GRIEF; AT LEAST IN HIS EYES AND TO HIS HEART. HE HAD ANOTHER GRIEF AT THE SAME TIME, THAT IS THE POIGNANT CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING ACTED CONTEMPTIBLY. HE ADMITTED THIS TO ME AFTERWARDS WITH PERFECT OPENNESS. AND YOU KNOW REAL GENUINE SORROW WILL SOMETIMES MAKE EVEN A PHENOMENALLY FRIVOLOUS, UNSTABLE MAN SOLID AND STOICAL; FOR A SHORT TIME AT ANY RATE; WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, EVEN FOOLS ARE BY GENUINE SORROW TURNED INTO WISE MEN, ALSO ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME OF COURSE; IT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF SORROW. AND IF SO, WHAT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN WITH A MAN LIKE STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH? IT WORKED A COMPLETE TRANSFORMATION‚ÄÎTHOUGH ALSO ONLY FOR A TIME, OF COURSE.

HE BOWED WITH DIGNITY TO VARVARA PETROVNA WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD (THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE LEFT FOR HIM TO DO, INDEED). HE WAS ON THE POINT OF GOING OUT WITHOUT A WORD, BUT COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM APPROACHING DARYA PAVLOVNA. SHE SEEMED TO FORESEE THAT HE WOULD DO SO, FOR SHE BEGAN SPEAKING OF HER OWN ACCORD HERSELF, IN UTTER DISMAY, AS THOUGH IN HASTE TO ANTICIPATE HIM.

‚ÄÚPLEASE, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, FOR GOD‚ÄÔS SAKE, DON‚ÄÔT SAY ANYTHING,‚ÄÙ SHE BEGAN, SPEAKING WITH HASTE AND EXCITEMENT, WITH A LOOK OF PAIN IN HER FACE, HURRIEDLY STRETCHING OUT HER HANDS TO HIM. ‚ÄÚBE SURE THAT I STILL RESPECT YOU AS MUCH ‚Ä¶ AND THINK JUST AS HIGHLY OF YOU, AND ‚Ä¶ THINK WELL OF ME TOO, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, THAT WILL MEAN A GREAT DEAL TO ME, A GREAT DEAL.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH MADE HER A VERY, VERY LOW BOW.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS FOR YOU TO DECIDE, DARYA PAVLOVNA; YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE PERFECTLY FREE IN THE WHOLE MATTER! YOU HAVE BEEN, AND YOU ARE NOW, AND YOU ALWAYS WILL BE,‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA CONCLUDED IMPRESSIVELY.

‚ÄÚBAH! NOW I UNDERSTAND IT ALL!‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, SLAPPING HIMSELF ON THE FOREHEAD. ‚ÄÚBUT ‚Ä¶ BUT WHAT A POSITION I AM PUT IN BY ALL THIS! DARYA PAVLOVNA, PLEASE FORGIVE ME!‚Ä¶ WHAT DO YOU CALL YOUR TREATMENT OF ME, EH?‚ÄÙ HE SAID, ADDRESSING HIS FATHER.

‚ÄÚPIERRE, YOU MIGHT SPEAK TO ME DIFFERENTLY, MIGHTN‚ÄÔT YOU, MY BOY,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH OBSERVED QUITE QUIETLY.

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT CRY OUT, PLEASE,‚ÄÙ SAID PIERRE, WITH A WAVE OF HIS HAND. ‚ÄÚBELIEVE ME, IT‚ÄÔS ALL YOUR SICK OLD NERVES, AND CRYING OUT WILL DO NO GOOD AT ALL. YOU‚ÄÔD BETTER TELL ME INSTEAD, WHY DIDN‚ÄÔT YOU WARN ME SINCE YOU MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED I SHOULD SPEAK OUT AT THE FIRST CHANCE?‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH LOOKED SEARCHINGLY AT HIM.

‚ÄÚPIERRE, YOU WHO KNOW SO MUCH OF WHAT GOES ON HERE, CAN YOU REALLY HAVE KNOWN NOTHING OF THIS BUSINESS AND HAVE HEARD NOTHING ABOUT IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT? WHAT A SET! SO IT‚ÄÔS NOT ENOUGH TO BE A CHILD IN YOUR OLD AGE, YOU MUST BE A SPITEFUL CHILD TOO! VARVARA PETROVNA, DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID?‚ÄÙ

THERE WAS A GENERAL OUTCRY; BUT THEN SUDDENLY AN INCIDENT TOOK PLACE WHICH NO ONE COULD HAVE ANTICIPATED.

VIII

FIRST OF ALL I MUST MENTION THAT, FOR THE LAST TWO OR THREE MINUTES LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA HAD SEEMED TO BE POSSESSED BY A NEW IMPULSE; SHE WAS WHISPERING SOMETHING HURRIEDLY TO HER MOTHER, AND TO MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, WHO BENT DOWN TO LISTEN. HER FACE WAS AGITATED, BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT HAD A LOOK OF RESOLUTION. AT LAST SHE GOT UP FROM HER SEAT IN EVIDENT HASTE TO GO AWAY, AND HURRIED HER MOTHER WHOM MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH BEGAN HELPING UP FROM HER LOW CHAIR. BUT IT SEEMED THEY WERE NOT DESTINED TO GET AWAY WITHOUT SEEING EVERYTHING TO THE END.

SHATOV, WHO HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN BY EVERY ONE IN HIS CORNER (NOT FAR FROM LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA), AND WHO DID NOT SEEM TO KNOW HIMSELF WHY HE WENT ON SITTING THERE, GOT UP FROM HIS CHAIR, AND WALKED, WITHOUT HASTE, WITH RESOLUTE STEPS RIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM TO NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, LOOKING HIM STRAIGHT IN THE FACE. THE LATTER NOTICED HIM APPROACHING AT SOME DISTANCE, AND FAINTLY SMILED, BUT WHEN SHATOV WAS CLOSE TO HIM HE LEFT OFF SMILING.

WHEN SHATOV STOOD STILL FACING HIM WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON HIM, AND WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD, EVERY ONE SUDDENLY NOTICED IT AND THERE WAS A GENERAL HUSH; PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS THE LAST TO CEASE SPEAKING. LIZA AND HER MOTHER WERE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM. SO PASSED FIVE SECONDS; THE LOOK OF HAUGHTY ASTONISHMENT WAS FOLLOWED BY ONE OF ANGER ON NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH‚ÄÔS FACE; HE SCOWLED.‚Ä¶

AND SUDDENLY SHATOV SWUNG HIS LONG, HEAVY ARM, AND WITH ALL HIS MIGHT STRUCK HIM A BLOW IN THE FACE. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH STAGGERED VIOLENTLY.

SHATOV STRUCK THE BLOW IN A PECULIAR WAY, NOT AT ALL AFTER THE CONVENTIONAL FASHION (IF ONE MAY USE SUCH AN EXPRESSION). IT WAS NOT A SLAP WITH THE PALM OF HIS HAND, BUT A BLOW WITH THE WHOLE FIST, AND IT WAS A BIG, HEAVY, BONY FIST COVERED WITH RED HAIRS AND FRECKLES. IF THE BLOW HAD STRUCK THE NOSE, IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN IT. BUT IT HIT HIM ON THE CHEEK, AND STRUCK THE LEFT CORNER OF THE LIP AND THE UPPER TEETH, FROM WHICH BLOOD STREAMED AT ONCE.

I BELIEVE THERE WAS A SUDDEN SCREAM, PERHAPS VARVARA PETROVNA SCREAMED‚ÄÎTHAT I DON‚ÄÔT REMEMBER, BECAUSE THERE WAS A DEAD HUSH AGAIN; THE WHOLE SCENE DID NOT LAST MORE THAN TEN SECONDS, HOWEVER.

YET A VERY GREAT DEAL HAPPENED IN THOSE SECONDS.

I MUST REMIND THE READER AGAIN THAT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH‚ÄÔS WAS ONE OF THOSE NATURES THAT KNOW NOTHING OF FEAR. AT A DUEL HE COULD FACE THE PISTOL OF HIS OPPONENT WITH INDIFFERENCE, AND COULD TAKE AIM AND KILL WITH BRUTAL COOLNESS. IF ANYONE HAD SLAPPED HIM IN THE FACE, I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED HIM NOT TO CHALLENGE HIS ASSAILANT TO A DUEL, BUT TO MURDER HIM ON THE SPOT. HE WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE CHARACTERS, AND WOULD HAVE KILLED THE MAN, KNOWING VERY WELL WHAT HE WAS DOING, AND WITHOUT LOSING HIS SELF-CONTROL. I FANCY, INDEED, THAT HE NEVER WAS LIABLE TO THOSE FITS OF BLIND RAGE WHICH DEPRIVE A MAN OF ALL POWER OF REFLECTION. EVEN WHEN OVERCOME WITH INTENSE ANGER, AS HE SOMETIMES WAS, HE WAS ALWAYS ABLE TO RETAIN COMPLETE SELF-CONTROL, AND THEREFORE TO REALISE THAT HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE SENT TO PENAL SERVITUDE FOR MURDERING A MAN NOT IN A DUEL; NEVERTHELESS, HE‚ÄÔD HAVE KILLED ANY ONE WHO INSULTED HIM, AND WITHOUT THE FAINTEST HESITATION.

I HAVE BEEN STUDYING NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH OF LATE, AND THROUGH SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES I KNOW A GREAT MANY FACTS ABOUT HIM NOW, AT THE TIME I WRITE. I SHOULD COMPARE HIM, PERHAPS, WITH SOME GENTLEMEN OF THE PAST OF WHOM LEGENDARY TRADITIONS ARE STILL PERCEIVED AMONG US. WE ARE TOLD, FOR INSTANCE, ABOUT THE DECABRIST L‚ÄÎN, THAT HE WAS ALWAYS SEEKING FOR DANGER, THAT HE REVELLED IN THE SENSATION, AND THAT IT HAD BECOME A CRAVING OF HIS NATURE; THAT IN HIS YOUTH HE HAD RUSHED INTO DUELS FOR NOTHING; THAT IN SIBERIA HE USED TO GO TO KILL BEARS WITH NOTHING BUT A KNIFE; THAT IN THE SIBERIAN FORESTS HE LIKED TO MEET WITH RUNAWAY CONVICTS, WHO ARE, I MAY OBSERVE IN PASSING, MORE FORMIDABLE THAN BEARS. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THESE LEGENDARY GENTLEMEN WERE CAPABLE OF A FEELING OF FEAR, AND EVEN TO AN EXTREME DEGREE, PERHAPS, OR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL QUIETER, AND A SENSE OF DANGER WOULD NEVER HAVE BECOME A PHYSICAL CRAVING WITH THEM. BUT THE CONQUEST OF FEAR WAS WHAT FASCINATED THEM. THE CONTINUAL ECSTASY OF VANQUISHING AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT NO ONE COULD VANQUISH THEM WAS WHAT ATTRACTED THEM. THE SAME L‚ÄÎN STRUGGLED WITH HUNGER FOR SOME TIME BEFORE HE WAS SENT INTO EXILE, AND TOILED TO EARN HIS DAILY BREAD SIMPLY BECAUSE HE DID NOT CARE TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUESTS OF HIS RICH FATHER, WHICH HE CONSIDERED UNJUST. SO HIS CONCEPTION OF STRUGGLE WAS MANY-SIDED, AND HE DID NOT PRIZE STOICISM AND STRENGTH OF CHARACTER ONLY IN DUELS AND BEAR-FIGHTS.

BUT MANY YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THOSE TIMES, AND THE NERVOUS, EXHAUSTED, COMPLEX CHARACTER OF THE MEN OF TO-DAY IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE CRAVING FOR THOSE DIRECT AND UNMIXED SENSATIONS WHICH WERE SO SOUGHT AFTER BY SOME RESTLESSLY ACTIVE GENTLEMEN OF THE GOOD OLD DAYS. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WOULD, PERHAPS, HAVE LOOKED DOWN ON L‚ÄÎN, AND HAVE CALLED HIM A BOASTFUL COCK-A-HOOP COWARD; IT‚ÄÔS TRUE HE WOULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE EXPRESSED HIMSELF ALOUD. STAVROGIN WOULD HAVE SHOT HIS OPPONENT IN A DUEL, AND WOULD HAVE FACED A BEAR IF NECESSARY, AND WOULD HAVE DEFENDED HIMSELF FROM A BRIGAND IN THE FOREST AS SUCCESSFULLY AND AS FEARLESSLY AS L‚ÄÎN, BUT IT WOULD BE WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST THRILL OF ENJOYMENT, LANGUIDLY, LISTLESSLY, EVEN WITH ENNUI AND ENTIRELY FROM UNPLEASANT NECESSITY. IN ANGER, OF COURSE, THERE HAS BEEN A PROGRESS COMPARED WITH L‚ÄÎN, EVEN COMPARED WITH LERMONTOV. THERE WAS PERHAPS MORE MALIGNANT ANGER IN NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH THAN IN BOTH PUT TOGETHER, BUT IT WAS A CALM, COLD, IF ONE MAY SO SAY, REASONABLE ANGER, AND THEREFORE THE MOST REVOLTING AND MOST TERRIBLE POSSIBLE. I REPEAT AGAIN, I CONSIDERED HIM THEN, AND I STILL CONSIDER HIM (NOW THAT EVERYTHING IS OVER), A MAN WHO, IF HE RECEIVED A SLAP IN THE FACE, OR ANY EQUIVALENT INSULT, WOULD BE CERTAIN TO KILL HIS ASSAILANT AT ONCE, ON THE SPOT, WITHOUT CHALLENGING HIM.

YET, IN THE PRESENT CASE, WHAT HAPPENED WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND AMAZING.

HE HAD SCARCELY REGAINED HIS BALANCE AFTER BEING ALMOST KNOCKED OVER IN THIS HUMILIATING WAY, AND THE HORRIBLE, AS IT WERE, SODDEN, THUD OF THE BLOW IN THE FACE HAD SCARCELY DIED AWAY IN THE ROOM WHEN HE SEIZED SHATOV BY THE SHOULDERS WITH BOTH HANDS, BUT AT ONCE, ALMOST AT THE SAME INSTANT, PULLED BOTH HANDS AWAY AND CLASPED THEM BEHIND HIS BACK. HE DID NOT SPEAK, BUT LOOKED AT SHATOV, AND TURNED AS WHITE AS HIS SHIRT. BUT, STRANGE TO SAY, THE LIGHT IN HIS EYES SEEMED TO DIE OUT. TEN SECONDS LATER HIS EYES LOOKED COLD, AND I‚ÄÔM SURE I‚ÄÔM NOT LYING‚ÄÎCALM. ONLY HE WAS TERRIBLY PALE. OF COURSE I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT WAS PASSING WITHIN THE MAN, I SAW ONLY HIS EXTERIOR. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF A MAN SHOULD SNATCH UP A BAR OF RED-HOT IRON AND HOLD IT TIGHT IN HIS HAND TO TEST HIS FORTITUDE, AND AFTER STRUGGLING FOR TEN SECONDS WITH INSUFFERABLE PAIN END BY OVERCOMING IT, SUCH A MAN WOULD, I FANCY, GO THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE WHAT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS ENDURING DURING THOSE TEN SECONDS.

SHATOV WAS THE FIRST TO DROP HIS EYES, AND EVIDENTLY BECAUSE HE WAS UNABLE TO GO ON FACING HIM; THEN HE TURNED SLOWLY AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM, BUT WITH A VERY DIFFERENT STEP. HE WITHDREW QUIETLY, WITH PECULIAR AWKWARDNESS, WITH HIS SHOULDERS HUNCHED, HIS HEAD HANGING AS THOUGH HE WERE INWARDLY PONDERING SOMETHING. I BELIEVE HE WAS WHISPERING SOMETHING. HE MADE HIS WAY TO THE DOOR CAREFULLY, WITHOUT STUMBLING AGAINST ANYTHING OR KNOCKING ANYTHING OVER; HE OPENED THE DOOR A VERY LITTLE WAY, AND SQUEEZED THROUGH ALMOST SIDEWAYS. AS HE WENT OUT HIS SHOCK OF HAIR STANDING ON END AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD WAS PARTICULARLY NOTICEABLE.

THEN FIRST OF ALL ONE FEARFUL SCREAM WAS HEARD. I SAW LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA SEIZE HER MOTHER BY THE SHOULDER AND MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH BY THE ARM AND MAKE TWO OR THREE VIOLENT EFFORTS TO DRAW THEM OUT OF THE ROOM. BUT SHE SUDDENLY UTTERED A SHRIEK, AND FELL FULL LENGTH ON THE FLOOR, FAINTING. I CAN HEAR THE THUD OF HER HEAD ON THE CARPET TO THIS DAY.

CHAPTER I. NIGHT

I

EIGHT DAYS HAD PASSED. NOW THAT IT IS ALL OVER AND I AM WRITING A RECORD OF IT, WE KNOW ALL ABOUT IT; BUT AT THE TIME WE KNEW NOTHING, AND IT WAS NATURAL THAT MANY THINGS SHOULD SEEM STRANGE TO US: STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH AND I, ANYWAY, SHUT OURSELVES UP FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE TIME, AND LOOKED ON WITH DISMAY FROM A DISTANCE. I DID, INDEED, GO ABOUT HERE AND THERE, AND, AS BEFORE, BROUGHT HIM VARIOUS ITEMS OF NEWS, WITHOUT WHICH HE COULD NOT EXIST.

I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THERE WERE RUMOURS OF THE MOST VARIED KIND GOING ABOUT THE TOWN IN REGARD TO THE BLOW THAT STAVROGIN HAD RECEIVED, LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA‚ÄÔS FAINTING FIT, AND ALL THAT HAPPENED ON THAT SUNDAY. BUT WHAT WE WONDERED WAS, THROUGH WHOM THE STORY HAD GOT ABOUT SO QUICKLY AND SO ACCURATELY. NOT ONE OF THE PERSONS PRESENT HAD ANY NEED TO GIVE AWAY THE SECRET OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED, OR INTEREST TO SERVE BY DOING SO.

THE SERVANTS HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT. LEBYADKIN WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO MIGHT HAVE CHATTERED, NOT SO MUCH FROM SPITE, FOR HE HAD GONE OUT IN GREAT ALARM (AND FEAR OF AN ENEMY DESTROYS SPITE AGAINST HIM), BUT SIMPLY FROM INCONTINENCE OF SPEECH. BUT LEBYADKIN AND HIS SISTER HAD DISAPPEARED NEXT DAY, AND NOTHING COULD BE HEARD OF THEM. THERE WAS NO TRACE OF THEM AT FILIPOV‚ÄÔS HOUSE, THEY HAD MOVED, NO ONE KNEW WHERE, AND SEEMED TO HAVE VANISHED. SHATOV, OF WHOM I WANTED TO INQUIRE ABOUT MARYA TIMOFYEVNA, WOULD NOT OPEN HIS DOOR, AND I BELIEVE SAT LOCKED UP IN HIS ROOM FOR THE WHOLE OF THOSE EIGHT DAYS, EVEN DISCONTINUING HIS WORK IN THE TOWN. HE WOULD NOT SEE ME. I WENT TO SEE HIM ON TUESDAY AND KNOCKED AT HIS DOOR. I GOT NO ANSWER, BUT BEING CONVINCED BY UNMISTAKABLE EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS AT HOME, I KNOCKED A SECOND TIME. THEN, JUMPING UP, APPARENTLY FROM HIS BED, HE STRODE TO THE DOOR AND SHOUTED AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE:

‚ÄÚSHATOV IS NOT AT HOME!‚ÄÙ

WITH THAT I WENT AWAY.

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH AND I, NOT WITHOUT DISMAY AT THE BOLDNESS OF THE SUPPOSITION, THOUGH WE TRIED TO ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER, REACHED AT LAST A CONCLUSION: WE MADE UP OUR MIND THAT THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SPREADING THESE RUMOURS WAS PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, THOUGH HE HIMSELF NOT LONG AFTER ASSURED HIS FATHER THAT HE HAD FOUND THE STORY ON EVERY ONE‚ÄÔS LIPS, ESPECIALLY AT THE CLUB, AND THAT THE GOVERNOR AND HIS WIFE WERE FAMILIAR WITH EVERY DETAIL OF IT. WHAT IS EVEN MORE REMARKABLE IS THAT THE NEXT DAY, MONDAY EVENING, I MET LIPUTIN, AND HE KNEW EVERY WORD THAT HAD BEEN PASSED, SO THAT HE MUST HAVE HEARD IT FIRST-HAND. MANY OF THE LADIES (AND SOME OF THE LEADING ONES) WERE VERY INQUISITIVE ABOUT THE ‚ÄÚMYSTERIOUS CRIPPLE,‚ÄÙ AS THEY CALLED MARYA TIMOFYEVNA. THERE WERE SOME, INDEED, WHO WERE ANXIOUS TO SEE HER AND MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE, SO THE INTERVENTION OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD BEEN IN SUCH HASTE TO CONCEAL THE LEBYADKINS WAS TIMELY. BUT LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA‚ÄÔS FAINTING CERTAINLY TOOK THE FOREMOST PLACE IN THE STORY, AND ‚ÄÚALL SOCIETY‚ÄÙ WAS INTERESTED, IF ONLY BECAUSE IT DIRECTLY CONCERNED YULIA MIHAILOVNA, AS THE KINSWOMAN AND PATRONESS OF THE YOUNG LADY. AND WHAT WAS THERE THEY DIDN‚ÄÔT SAY! WHAT INCREASED THE GOSSIP WAS THE MYSTERIOUS POSITION OF AFFAIRS; BOTH HOUSES WERE OBSTINATELY CLOSED; LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA, SO THEY SAID, WAS IN BED WITH BRAIN FEVER. THE SAME THING WAS ASSERTED OF NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, WITH THE REVOLTING ADDITION OF A TOOTH KNOCKED OUT AND A SWOLLEN FACE. IT WAS EVEN WHISPERED IN CORNERS THAT THERE WOULD SOON BE MURDER AMONG US, THAT STAVROGIN WAS NOT THE MAN TO PUT UP WITH SUCH AN INSULT, AND THAT HE WOULD KILL SHATOV, BUT WITH THE SECRECY OF A CORSICAN VENDETTA. PEOPLE LIKED THIS IDEA, BUT THE MAJORITY OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE LISTENED WITH CONTEMPT, AND WITH AN AIR OF THE MOST NONCHALANT INDIFFERENCE, WHICH WAS, OF COURSE, ASSUMED. THE OLD HOSTILITY TO NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH IN THE TOWN WAS IN GENERAL STRIKINGLY MANIFEST. EVEN SOBER-MINDED PEOPLE WERE EAGER TO THROW BLAME ON HIM THOUGH THEY COULD NOT HAVE SAID FOR WHAT. IT WAS WHISPERED THAT HE HAD RUINED LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA‚ÄÔS REPUTATION, AND THAT THERE HAD BEEN AN INTRIGUE BETWEEN THEM IN SWITZERLAND. CAUTIOUS PEOPLE, OF COURSE, RESTRAINED THEMSELVES, BUT ALL LISTENED WITH RELISH. THERE WERE OTHER THINGS SAID, THOUGH NOT IN PUBLIC, BUT IN PRIVATE, ON RARE OCCASIONS AND ALMOST IN SECRET, EXTREMELY STRANGE THINGS, TO WHICH I ONLY REFER TO WARN MY READERS OF THEM WITH A VIEW TO THE LATER EVENTS OF MY STORY. SOME PEOPLE, WITH KNITTED BROWS, SAID, GOD KNOWS ON WHAT FOUNDATION, THAT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAD SOME SPECIAL BUSINESS IN OUR PROVINCE, THAT HE HAD, THROUGH COUNT K., BEEN BROUGHT INTO TOUCH WITH EXALTED CIRCLES IN PETERSBURG, THAT HE WAS EVEN, PERHAPS, IN GOVERNMENT SERVICE, AND MIGHT ALMOST BE SAID TO HAVE BEEN FURNISHED WITH SOME SORT OF COMMISSION FROM SOMEONE. WHEN VERY SOBER-MINDED AND SENSIBLE PEOPLE SMILED AT THIS RUMOUR, OBSERVING VERY REASONABLY THAT A MAN ALWAYS MIXED UP WITH SCANDALS, AND WHO WAS BEGINNING HIS CAREER AMONG US WITH A SWOLLEN FACE DID NOT LOOK LIKE A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, THEY WERE TOLD IN A WHISPER THAT HE WAS EMPLOYED NOT IN THE OFFICIAL, BUT, SO TO SAY, THE CONFIDENTIAL SERVICE, AND THAT IN SUCH CASES IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO BE AS LITTLE LIKE AN OFFICIAL AS POSSIBLE. THIS REMARK PRODUCED A SENSATION; WE KNEW THAT THE ZEMSTVO OF OUR PROVINCE WAS THE OBJECT OF MARKED ATTENTION IN THE CAPITAL. I REPEAT, THESE WERE ONLY FLITTING RUMOURS THAT DISAPPEARED FOR A TIME WHEN NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH FIRST CAME AMONG US. BUT I MAY OBSERVE THAT MANY OF THE RUMOURS WERE PARTLY DUE TO A FEW BRIEF BUT MALICIOUS WORDS, VAGUELY AND DISCONNECTEDLY DROPPED AT THE CLUB BY A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD LATELY RETURNED FROM PETERSBURG. THIS WAS A RETIRED CAPTAIN IN THE GUARDS, ARTEMY PAVLOVITCH GAGANOV. HE WAS A VERY LARGE LANDOWNER IN OUR PROVINCE AND DISTRICT, A MAN USED TO THE SOCIETY OF PETERSBURG, AND A SON OF THE LATE PAVEL PAVLOVITCH GAGANOV, THE VENERABLE OLD MAN WITH WHOM NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAD, OVER FOUR YEARS BEFORE, HAD THE EXTRAORDINARILY COARSE AND SUDDEN ENCOUNTER WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED ALREADY IN THE BEGINNING OF MY STORY.

IT IMMEDIATELY BECAME KNOWN TO EVERY ONE THAT YULIA MIHAILOVNA HAD MADE A SPECIAL CALL ON VARVARA PETROVNA, AND HAD BEEN INFORMED AT THE ENTRANCE: ‚ÄÚHER HONOUR WAS TOO UNWELL TO SEE VISITORS.‚ÄÙ IT WAS KNOWN, TOO, THAT YULIA MIHAILOVNA SENT A MESSAGE TWO DAYS LATER TO INQUIRE AFTER VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS HEALTH. AT LAST SHE BEGAN ‚ÄÚDEFENDING‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA EVERYWHERE, OF COURSE ONLY IN THE LOFTIEST SENSE, THAT IS, IN THE VAGUEST POSSIBLE WAY. SHE LISTENED COLDLY AND STERNLY TO THE HURRIED REMARKS MADE AT FIRST ABOUT THE SCENE ON SUNDAY, SO THAT DURING THE LATER DAYS THEY WERE NOT RENEWED IN HER PRESENCE. SO THAT THE BELIEF GAINED GROUND EVERYWHERE THAT YULIA MIHAILOVNA KNEW NOT ONLY THE WHOLE OF THE MYSTERIOUS STORY BUT ALL ITS SECRET SIGNIFICANCE TO THE SMALLEST DETAIL, AND NOT AS AN OUTSIDER, BUT AS ONE TAKING PART IN IT. I MAY OBSERVE, BY THE WAY, THAT SHE WAS ALREADY GRADUALLY BEGINNING TO GAIN THAT EXALTED INFLUENCE AMONG US FOR WHICH SHE WAS SO EAGER AND WHICH SHE WAS CERTAINLY STRUGGLING TO WIN, AND WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO SEE HERSELF ‚ÄÚSURROUNDED BY A CIRCLE.‚ÄÙ A SECTION OF SOCIETY RECOGNISED HER PRACTICAL SENSE AND TACT ‚Ä¶ BUT OF THAT LATER. HER PATRONAGE PARTLY EXPLAINED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS RAPID SUCCESS IN OUR SOCIETY‚ÄÎA SUCCESS WITH WHICH STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED AT THE TIME.

WE POSSIBLY EXAGGERATED IT. TO BEGIN WITH, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SEEMED TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE ALMOST INSTANTLY WITH THE WHOLE TOWN WITHIN THE FIRST FOUR DAYS OF HIS ARRIVAL. HE ONLY ARRIVED ON SUNDAY; AND ON TUESDAY I SAW HIM IN A CARRIAGE WITH ARTEMY PAVLOVITCH GAGANOV, A MAN WHO WAS PROUD, IRRITABLE, AND SUPERCILIOUS, IN SPITE OF HIS GOOD BREEDING, AND WHO WAS NOT EASY TO GET ON WITH. AT THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS, TOO, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH MET WITH A WARM WELCOME, SO MUCH SO THAT HE WAS AT ONCE ON AN INTIMATE FOOTING, LIKE A YOUNG FRIEND, TREATED, SO TO SAY, AFFECTIONATELY. HE DINED WITH YULIA MIHAILOVNA ALMOST EVERY DAY. HE HAD MADE HER ACQUAINTANCE IN SWITZERLAND, BUT THERE WAS CERTAINLY SOMETHING CURIOUS ABOUT THE RAPIDITY OF HIS SUCCESS IN THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS HOUSE. IN ANY CASE HE WAS REPUTED, WHETHER TRULY OR NOT, TO HAVE BEEN AT ONE TIME A REVOLUTIONIST ABROAD, HE HAD HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH SOME PUBLICATIONS AND SOME CONGRESSES ABROAD, ‚ÄÚWHICH ONE CAN PROVE FROM THE NEWSPAPERS,‚ÄÙ TO QUOTE THE MALICIOUS REMARK OF ALYOSHA TELYATNIKOV, WHO HAD ALSO BEEN ONCE A YOUNG FRIEND AFFECTIONATELY TREATED IN THE HOUSE OF THE LATE GOVERNOR, BUT WAS NOW, ALAS, A CLERK ON THE RETIRED LIST. BUT THE FACT WAS UNMISTAKABLE: THE FORMER REVOLUTIONIST, FAR FROM BEING HINDERED FROM RETURNING TO HIS BELOVED FATHERLAND, SEEMED ALMOST TO HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED TO DO SO, SO PERHAPS THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT. LIPUTIN WHISPERED TO ME ONCE THAT THERE WERE RUMOURS THAT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD ONCE PROFESSED HIMSELF PENITENT, AND ON HIS RETURN HAD BEEN PARDONED ON MENTIONING CERTAIN NAMES AND SO, PERHAPS, HAD SUCCEEDED IN EXPIATING HIS OFFENCE, BY PROMISING TO BE OF USE TO THE GOVERNMENT IN THE FUTURE. I REPEATED THESE MALIGNANT PHRASES TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, AND ALTHOUGH THE LATTER WAS IN SUCH A STATE THAT HE WAS HARDLY CAPABLE OF REFLECTION, HE PONDERED PROFOUNDLY. IT TURNED OUT LATER THAT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD COME TO US WITH A VERY INFLUENTIAL LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION, THAT HE HAD, AT ANY RATE, BROUGHT ONE TO THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE FROM A VERY IMPORTANT OLD LADY IN PETERSBURG, WHOSE HUSBAND WAS ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED OLD DIGNITARIES IN THE CAPITAL. THIS OLD LADY, WHO WAS YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS GODMOTHER, MENTIONED IN HER LETTER THAT COUNT K. KNEW PYOTR STEPANOVITCH VERY WELL THROUGH NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, MADE MUCH OF HIM, AND THOUGHT HIM ‚ÄÚA VERY EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN IN SPITE OF HIS FORMER ERRORS.‚ÄÙ YULIA MIHAILOVNA SET THE GREATEST VALUE ON HER RELATIONS WITH THE ‚ÄÚHIGHER SPHERES,‚ÄÙ WHICH WERE FEW AND MAINTAINED WITH DIFFICULTY, AND WAS, NO DOUBT, PLEASED TO GET THE OLD LADY‚ÄÔS LETTER, BUT STILL THERE WAS SOMETHING PECULIAR ABOUT IT. SHE EVEN FORCED HER HUSBAND UPON A FAMILIAR FOOTING WITH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, SO MUCH SO THAT MR. VON LEMBKE COMPLAINED OF IT ‚Ä¶ BUT OF THAT, TOO, LATER. I MAY MENTION, TOO, THAT THE GREAT AUTHOR WAS ALSO FAVOURABLY DISPOSED TO PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, AND AT ONCE INVITED HIM TO GO AND SEE HIM. SUCH ALACRITY ON THE PART OF A MAN SO PUFFED UP WITH CONCEIT STUNG STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH MORE PAINFULLY THAN ANYTHING; BUT I PUT A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION ON IT. IN INVITING A NIHILIST TO SEE HIM, MR. KARMAZINOV, NO DOUBT, HAD IN VIEW HIS RELATIONS WITH THE PROGRESSIVES OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION IN BOTH CAPITALS. THE GREAT AUTHOR TREMBLED NERVOUSLY BEFORE THE REVOLUTIONARY YOUTH OF RUSSIA, AND IMAGINING, IN HIS IGNORANCE, THAT THE FUTURE LAY IN THEIR HANDS, FAWNED UPON THEM IN A DESPICABLE WAY, CHIEFLY BECAUSE THEY PAID NO ATTENTION TO HIM WHATEVER.

II

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH RAN ROUND TO SEE HIS FATHER TWICE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY I WAS ABSENT ON BOTH OCCASIONS. HE VISITED HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLY ON WEDNESDAY, THAT IS, NOT TILL THE FOURTH DAY AFTER THEIR FIRST MEETING, AND THEN ONLY ON BUSINESS. THEIR DIFFICULTIES OVER THE PROPERTY WERE SETTLED, BY THE WAY, WITHOUT FUSS OR PUBLICITY. VARVARA PETROVNA TOOK IT ALL ON HERSELF, AND PAID ALL THAT WAS OWING, TAKING OVER THE LAND, OF COURSE, AND ONLY INFORMED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH THAT IT WAS ALL SETTLED AND HER BUTLER, ALEXEY YEGORYTCH, WAS, BY HER AUTHORISATION, BRINGING HIM SOMETHING TO SIGN. THIS STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH DID, IN SILENCE, WITH EXTREME DIGNITY. APROPOS OF HIS DIGNITY, I MAY MENTION THAT I HARDLY RECOGNISED MY OLD FRIEND DURING THOSE DAYS. HE BEHAVED AS HE HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE; BECAME AMAZINGLY TACITURN AND HAD NOT EVEN WRITTEN ONE LETTER TO VARVARA PETROVNA SINCE SUNDAY, WHICH SEEMED TO ME ALMOST A MIRACLE. WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, HE HAD BECOME QUITE CALM. HE HAD FASTENED UPON A FINAL AND DECISIVE IDEA WHICH GAVE HIM TRANQUILLITY. THAT WAS EVIDENT. HE HAD HIT UPON THIS IDEA, AND SAT STILL, EXPECTING SOMETHING. AT FIRST, HOWEVER, HE WAS ILL, ESPECIALLY ON MONDAY. HE HAD AN ATTACK OF HIS SUMMER CHOLERA. HE COULD NOT REMAIN ALL THAT TIME WITHOUT NEWS EITHER; BUT AS SOON AS I DEPARTED FROM THE STATEMENT OF FACTS, AND BEGAN DISCUSSING THE CASE IN ITSELF, AND FORMULATED ANY THEORY, HE AT ONCE GESTICULATED TO ME TO STOP. BUT BOTH HIS INTERVIEWS WITH HIS SON HAD A DISTRESSING EFFECT ON HIM, THOUGH THEY DID NOT SHAKE HIS DETERMINATION. AFTER EACH INTERVIEW HE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY LYING ON THE SOFA WITH A HANDKERCHIEF SOAKED IN VINEGAR ON HIS HEAD. BUT HE CONTINUED TO REMAIN CALM IN THE DEEPEST SENSE.

SOMETIMES, HOWEVER, HE DID NOT HINDER MY SPEAKING. SOMETIMES, TOO, IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE MYSTERIOUS DETERMINATION HE HAD TAKEN SEEMED TO BE FAILING HIM AND HE APPEARED TO BE STRUGGLING WITH A NEW, SEDUCTIVE STREAM OF IDEAS. THAT WAS ONLY AT MOMENTS, BUT I MADE A NOTE OF IT. I SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS LONGING TO ASSERT HIMSELF AGAIN, TO COME FORTH FROM HIS SECLUSION, TO SHOW FIGHT, TO STRUGGLE TO THE LAST.

‚ÄÚCHER, I COULD CRUSH THEM!‚ÄÙ BROKE FROM HIM ON THURSDAY EVENING AFTER HIS SECOND INTERVIEW WITH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WHEN HE LAY STRETCHED ON THE SOFA WITH HIS HEAD WRAPPED IN A TOWEL.

TILL THAT MOMENT HE HAD NOT UTTERED ONE WORD ALL DAY.

‚ÄÚFILS, FILS, CHER,‚ÄÙ AND SO ON, ‚ÄÚI AGREE ALL THOSE EXPRESSIONS ARE NONSENSE, KITCHEN TALK, AND SO BE IT. I SEE IT FOR MYSELF. I NEVER GAVE HIM FOOD OR DRINK, I SENT HIM A TINY BABY FROM BERLIN TO X PROVINCE BY POST, AND ALL THAT, I ADMIT IT.‚Ä¶ ‚ÄÒYOU GAVE ME NEITHER FOOD NOR DRINK, AND SENT ME BY POST,‚ÄÔ HE SAYS, ‚ÄÒAND WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE YOU‚ÄÔVE ROBBED ME HERE.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒBUT YOU UNHAPPY BOY,‚ÄÔ I CRIED TO HIM, ‚ÄÒMY HEART HAS BEEN ACHING FOR YOU ALL MY LIFE; THOUGH I DID SEND YOU BY POST.‚ÄÔ IL RIT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT I ADMIT IT. I ADMIT IT, GRANTED IT WAS BY POST,‚ÄÙ HE CONCLUDED, ALMOST IN DELIRIUM.

‚ÄÚPASSONS,‚ÄÙ HE BEGAN AGAIN, FIVE MINUTES LATER. ‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND TURGENEV. THAT BAZAROV OF HIS IS A FICTITIOUS FIGURE, IT DOES NOT EXIST ANYWHERE. THE FELLOWS THEMSELVES WERE THE FIRST TO DISOWN HIM AS UNLIKE ANYONE. THAT BAZAROV IS A SORT OF INDISTINCT MIXTURE OF NOZDRYOV AND BYRON, C‚ÄÔEST LE MOT. LOOK AT THEM ATTENTIVELY: THEY CAPER ABOUT AND SQUEAL WITH JOY LIKE PUPPIES IN THE SUN. THEY ARE HAPPY, THEY ARE VICTORIOUS! WHAT IS THERE OF BYRON IN THEM!‚Ä¶ AND WITH THAT, SUCH ORDINARINESS! WHAT A LOW-BRED, IRRITABLE VANITY! WHAT AN ABJECT CRAVING TO FAIRE DU BRUIT AUTOUR DE SON NOM, WITHOUT NOTICING THAT SON NOM.‚Ä¶ OH, IT‚ÄÔS A CARICATURE! ‚ÄÒSURELY,‚ÄÔ I CRIED TO HIM, ‚ÄÒYOU DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO OFFER YOURSELF JUST AS YOU ARE AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR CHRIST?‚ÄÔ IL RIT. IL RIT BEAUCOUP. IL RIT TROP. HE HAS A STRANGE SMILE. HIS MOTHER HAD NOT A SMILE LIKE THAT. IL RIT TOUJOURS.‚ÄÙ

SILENCE FOLLOWED AGAIN.

‚ÄÚTHEY ARE CUNNING; THEY WERE ACTING IN COLLUSION ON SUNDAY,‚ÄÙ HE BLURTED OUT SUDDENLY.‚Ä¶

‚ÄÚOH, NOT A DOUBT OF IT,‚ÄÙ I CRIED, PRICKING UP MY EARS. ‚ÄÚIT WAS A GOT-UP THING AND IT WAS TOO TRANSPARENT, AND SO BADLY ACTED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT MEAN THAT. DO YOU KNOW THAT IT WAS ALL TOO TRANSPARENT ON PURPOSE, THAT THOSE ‚Ä¶ WHO HAD TO, MIGHT UNDERSTAND IT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTANT MIEUX; PASSONS. I AM VERY IRRITABLE TO-DAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT WHY HAVE YOU BEEN ARGUING WITH HIM, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH?‚ÄÙ I ASKED HIM REPROACHFULLY.

‚ÄÚJE VOULAIS CONVERTIR‚ÄÎYOU‚ÄÔLL LAUGH OF COURSE‚ÄÎCETTE PAUVRE AUNTIE, ELLE ENTENDRA DE BELLES CHOSES! OH, MY DEAR BOY, WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT. I FELT LIKE A PATRIOT. I ALWAYS RECOGNISED THAT I WAS A RUSSIAN, HOWEVER ‚Ä¶ A GENUINE RUSSIAN MUST BE LIKE YOU AND ME. IL Y A L√† DEDANS QUELQUE CHOSE D‚ÄÔAVEUGLE ET DE LOUCHE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOT A DOUBT OF IT,‚ÄÙ I ASSENTED.

‚ÄÚMY DEAR, THE REAL TRUTH ALWAYS SOUNDS IMPROBABLE, DO YOU KNOW THAT? TO MAKE TRUTH SOUND PROBABLE YOU MUST ALWAYS MIX IN SOME FALSEHOOD WITH IT. MEN HAVE ALWAYS DONE SO. PERHAPS THERE‚ÄÔS SOMETHING IN IT THAT PASSES OUR UNDERSTANDING. WHAT DO YOU THINK: IS THERE SOMETHING WE DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND IN THAT TRIUMPHANT SQUEAL? I SHOULD LIKE TO THINK THERE WAS. I SHOULD LIKE TO THINK SO.‚ÄÙ

I DID NOT SPEAK. HE, TOO, WAS SILENT FOR A LONG TIME. ‚ÄÚTHEY SAY THAT FRENCH CLEVERNESS ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HE BABBLED SUDDENLY, AS THOUGH IN A FEVER ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS FALSE, IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN. WHY LIBEL FRENCH CLEVERNESS? IT‚ÄÔS SIMPLY RUSSIAN INDOLENCE, OUR DEGRADING IMPOTENCE TO PRODUCE IDEAS, OUR REVOLTING PARASITISM IN THE RANK OF NATIONS. ILS SONT TOUT SIMPLEMENT DES PARESSEUX, AND NOT FRENCH CLEVERNESS. OH, THE RUSSIANS OUGHT TO BE EXTIRPATED FOR THE GOOD OF HUMANITY, LIKE NOXIOUS PARASITES! WE‚ÄÔVE BEEN STRIVING FOR SOMETHING UTTERLY, UTTERLY DIFFERENT. I CAN MAKE NOTHING OF IT. I HAVE GIVEN UP UNDERSTANDING. ‚ÄÒDO YOU UNDERSTAND,‚ÄÔ I CRIED TO HIM, ‚ÄÒTHAT IF YOU HAVE THE GUILLOTINE IN THE FOREGROUND OF YOUR PROGRAMME AND ARE SO ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT TOO, IT‚ÄÔS SIMPLY BECAUSE NOTHING‚ÄÔS EASIER THAN CUTTING OFF HEADS, AND NOTHING‚ÄÔS HARDER THAN TO HAVE AN IDEA. VOUS √™TES DES PARESSEUX! VOTRE DRAPEAU EST UN GUENILLE, UNE IMPUISSANCE. IT‚ÄÔS THOSE CARTS, OR, WHAT WAS IT?‚Ä¶ THE RUMBLE OF THE CARTS CARRYING BREAD TO HUMANITY BEING MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE SISTINE MADONNA, OR, WHAT‚ÄÔS THE SAYING?‚Ä¶ UNE B√™TISE DANS CE GENRE. DON‚ÄÔT YOU UNDERSTAND, DON‚ÄÔT YOU UNDERSTAND,‚ÄÔ I SAID TO HIM, ‚ÄÒTHAT UNHAPPINESS IS JUST AS NECESSARY TO MAN AS HAPPINESS.‚ÄÔ IL RIT. ‚ÄÒALL YOU DO IS TO MAKE A BON MOT,‚ÄÔ HE SAID, ‚ÄÒWITH YOUR LIMBS SNUG ON A VELVET SOFA.‚ÄÔ ‚Ä¶ (HE USED A COARSER EXPRESSION.) AND THIS HABIT OF ADDRESSING A FATHER SO FAMILIARLY IS VERY NICE WHEN FATHER AND SON ARE ON GOOD TERMS, BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT WHEN THEY ARE ABUSING ONE ANOTHER?‚ÄÙ

WE WERE SILENT AGAIN FOR A MINUTE.

‚ÄÚCHER,‚ÄÙ HE CONCLUDED AT LAST, GETTING UP QUICKLY, ‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW THIS IS BOUND TO END IN SOMETHING?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOF COURSE,‚ÄÙ SAID I.

‚ÄÚVOUS NE COMPRENEZ PAS. PASSONS. BUT ‚Ä¶ USUALLY IN OUR WORLD THINGS COME TO NOTHING, BUT THIS WILL END IN SOMETHING; IT‚ÄÔS BOUND TO, IT‚ÄÔS BOUND TO!‚ÄÙ

HE GOT UP, AND WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM IN VIOLENT EMOTION, AND COMING BACK TO THE SOFA SANK ON TO IT EXHAUSTED.

ON FRIDAY MORNING, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WENT OFF SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, AND REMAINED AWAY TILL MONDAY. I HEARD OF HIS DEPARTURE FROM LIPUTIN, AND IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION I LEARNED THAT THE LEBYADKINS, BROTHER AND SISTER, HAD MOVED TO THE RIVERSIDE QUARTER. ‚ÄÚI MOVED THEM,‚ÄÙ HE ADDED, AND, DROPPING THE LEBYADKINS, HE SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED TO ME THAT LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA WAS GOING TO MARRY MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, THAT, ALTHOUGH IT HAD NOT BEEN ANNOUNCED, THE ENGAGEMENT WAS A SETTLED THING. NEXT DAY I MET LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA OUT RIDING WITH MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH; SHE WAS OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER HER ILLNESS. SHE BEAMED AT ME FROM THE DISTANCE, LAUGHED, AND NODDED IN A VERY FRIENDLY WAY. I TOLD ALL THIS TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH; HE PAID NO ATTENTION, EXCEPT TO THE NEWS ABOUT THE LEBYADKINS.

AND NOW, HAVING DESCRIBED OUR ENIGMATIC POSITION THROUGHOUT THOSE EIGHT DAYS DURING WHICH WE KNEW NOTHING, I WILL PASS ON TO THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SUCCEEDING INCIDENTS OF MY CHRONICLE, WRITING, SO TO SAY, WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE, AND DESCRIBING THINGS AS THEY BECAME KNOWN AFTERWARDS, AND ARE CLEARLY SEEN TO-DAY. I WILL BEGIN WITH THE EIGHTH DAY AFTER THAT SUNDAY, THAT IS, THE MONDAY EVENING‚ÄÎFOR IN REALITY A ‚ÄÚNEW SCANDAL‚ÄÙ BEGAN WITH THAT EVENING.

III

IT WAS SEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE EVENING. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS SITTING ALONE IN HIS STUDY‚ÄÎTHE ROOM HE HAD BEEN FOND OF IN OLD DAYS. IT WAS LOFTY, CARPETED WITH RUGS, AND CONTAINED SOMEWHAT HEAVY OLD-FASHIONED FURNITURE. HE WAS SITTING ON THE SOFA IN THE CORNER, DRESSED AS THOUGH TO GO OUT, THOUGH HE DID NOT SEEM TO BE INTENDING TO DO SO. ON THE TABLE BEFORE HIM STOOD A LAMP WITH A SHADE. THE SIDES AND CORNERS OF THE BIG ROOM WERE LEFT IN SHADOW. HIS EYES LOOKED DREAMY AND CONCENTRATED, NOT ALTOGETHER TRANQUIL; HIS FACE LOOKED TIRED AND HAD GROWN A LITTLE THINNER. HE REALLY WAS ILL WITH A SWOLLEN FACE; BUT THE STORY OF A TOOTH HAVING BEEN KNOCKED OUT WAS AN EXAGGERATION. ONE HAD BEEN LOOSENED, BUT IT HAD GROWN INTO ITS PLACE AGAIN: HE HAD HAD A CUT ON THE INNER SIDE OF THE UPPER LIP, BUT THAT, TOO, HAD HEALED. THE SWELLING ON HIS FACE HAD LASTED ALL THE WEEK SIMPLY BECAUSE THE INVALID WOULD NOT HAVE A DOCTOR, AND INSTEAD OF HAVING THE SWELLING LANCED HAD WAITED FOR IT TO GO DOWN. HE WOULD NOT HEAR OF A DOCTOR, AND WOULD SCARCELY ALLOW EVEN HIS MOTHER TO COME NEAR HIM, AND THEN ONLY FOR A MOMENT, ONCE A DAY, AND ONLY AT DUSK, AFTER IT WAS DARK AND BEFORE LIGHTS HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN. HE DID NOT RECEIVE PYOTR STEPANOVITCH EITHER, THOUGH THE LATTER RAN ROUND TO VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY SO LONG AS HE REMAINED IN THE TOWN. AND NOW, AT LAST, RETURNING ON THE MONDAY MORNING AFTER HIS THREE DAYS‚ÄÔ ABSENCE, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH MADE A CIRCUIT OF THE TOWN, AND, AFTER DINING AT YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS, CAME AT LAST IN THE EVENING TO VARVARA PETROVNA, WHO WAS IMPATIENTLY EXPECTING HIM. THE INTERDICT HAD BEEN REMOVED, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS ‚ÄÚAT HOME.‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA HERSELF LED THE VISITOR TO THE DOOR OF THE STUDY; SHE HAD LONG LOOKED FORWARD TO THEIR MEETING, AND PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD PROMISED TO RUN TO HER AND REPEAT WHAT PASSED. SHE KNOCKED TIMIDLY AT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH‚ÄÔS DOOR, AND GETTING NO ANSWER VENTURED TO OPEN THE DOOR A COUPLE OF INCHES.

‚ÄÚNICOLAS, MAY I BRING PYOTR STEPANOVITCH IN TO SEE YOU?‚ÄÙ SHE ASKED, IN A SOFT AND RESTRAINED VOICE, TRYING TO MAKE OUT HER SON‚ÄÔS FACE BEHIND THE LAMP.

‚ÄÚYOU CAN‚ÄÎYOU CAN, OF COURSE YOU CAN,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HIMSELF CRIED OUT, LOUDLY AND GAILY. HE OPENED THE DOOR WITH HIS HAND AND WENT IN.

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAD NOT HEARD THE KNOCK AT THE DOOR, AND ONLY CAUGHT HIS MOTHER‚ÄÔS TIMID QUESTION, AND HAD NOT HAD TIME TO ANSWER IT. BEFORE HIM, AT THAT MOMENT, THERE LAY A LETTER HE HAD JUST READ OVER, WHICH HE WAS PONDERING DEEPLY. HE STARTED, HEARING PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS SUDDEN OUTBURST, AND HURRIEDLY PUT THE LETTER UNDER A PAPER-WEIGHT, BUT DID NOT QUITE SUCCEED; A CORNER OF THE LETTER AND ALMOST THE WHOLE ENVELOPE SHOWED.

‚ÄÚI CALLED OUT ON PURPOSE THAT YOU MIGHT BE PREPARED,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SAID HURRIEDLY, WITH SURPRISING NA√ØVET√©, RUNNING UP TO THE TABLE, AND INSTANTLY STARING AT THE CORNER OF THE LETTER, WHICH PEEPED OUT FROM BENEATH THE PAPER-WEIGHT.

‚ÄÚAND NO DOUBT YOU HAD TIME TO SEE HOW I HID THE LETTER I HAD JUST RECEIVED, UNDER THE PAPER-WEIGHT,‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH CALMLY, WITHOUT MOVING FROM HIS PLACE.

‚ÄÚA LETTER? BLESS YOU AND YOUR LETTERS, WHAT ARE THEY TO DO WITH ME?‚ÄÙ CRIED THE VISITOR. ‚ÄÚBUT ‚Ä¶ WHAT DOES MATTER ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HE WHISPERED AGAIN, TURNING TO THE DOOR, WHICH WAS BY NOW CLOSED, AND NODDING HIS HEAD IN THAT DIRECTION.

‚ÄÚSHE NEVER LISTENS,‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH OBSERVED COLDLY.

‚ÄÚWHAT IF SHE DID OVERHEAR?‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, RAISING HIS VOICE CHEERFULLY, AND SETTLING DOWN IN AN ARM-CHAIR. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE NOTHING AGAINST THAT, ONLY I‚ÄÔVE COME HERE NOW TO SPEAK TO YOU ALONE. WELL, AT LAST I‚ÄÔVE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING AT YOU. FIRST OF ALL, HOW ARE YOU? I SEE YOU‚ÄÔRE GETTING ON SPLENDIDLY. TO-MORROW YOU‚ÄÔLL SHOW YOURSELF AGAIN‚ÄÎEH?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPERHAPS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSET THEIR MINDS AT REST. SET MINE AT REST AT LAST.‚ÄÙ HE GESTICULATED VIOLENTLY WITH A JOCOSE AND AMIABLE AIR. ‚ÄÚIF ONLY YOU KNEW WHAT NONSENSE I‚ÄÔVE HAD TO TALK TO THEM. YOU KNOW, THOUGH.‚ÄÙ HE LAUGHED.

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT KNOW EVERYTHING. I ONLY HEARD FROM MY MOTHER THAT YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN ‚Ä¶ VERY ACTIVE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, WELL, I‚ÄÔVE SAID NOTHING DEFINITE,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH FLARED UP AT ONCE, AS THOUGH DEFENDING HIMSELF FROM AN AWFUL ATTACK. ‚ÄÚI SIMPLY TROTTED OUT SHATOV‚ÄÔS WIFE; YOU KNOW, THAT IS, THE RUMOURS OF YOUR LIAISON IN PARIS, WHICH ACCOUNTED, OF COURSE, FOR WHAT HAPPENED ON SUNDAY. YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT ANGRY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM SURE YOU‚ÄÔVE DONE YOUR BEST.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, THAT‚ÄÔS JUST WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF. THOUGH WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, ‚ÄÒDONE YOUR BEST‚ÄÔ? THAT‚ÄÔS A REPROACH, ISN‚ÄÔT IT? YOU ALWAYS GO STRAIGHT FOR THINGS, THOUGH.‚Ä¶ WHAT I WAS MOST AFRAID OF, AS I CAME HERE, WAS THAT YOU WOULDN‚ÄÔT GO STRAIGHT FOR THE POINT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO GO STRAIGHT FOR ANYTHING,‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WITH SOME IRRITATION. BUT HE LAUGHED AT ONCE.

‚ÄÚI DIDN‚ÄÔT MEAN THAT, I DIDN‚ÄÔT MEAN THAT, DON‚ÄÔT MAKE A MISTAKE,‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WAVING HIS HANDS, RATTLING HIS WORDS OUT LIKE PEAS, AND AT ONCE RELIEVED AT HIS COMPANION‚ÄÔS IRRITABILITY. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM NOT GOING TO WORRY YOU WITH OUR BUSINESS, ESPECIALLY IN YOUR PRESENT POSITION. I‚ÄÔVE ONLY COME ABOUT SUNDAY‚ÄÔS AFFAIR, AND ONLY TO ARRANGE THE MOST NECESSARY STEPS, BECAUSE, YOU SEE, IT‚ÄÔS IMPOSSIBLE. I‚ÄÔVE COME WITH THE FRANKEST EXPLANATIONS WHICH I STAND IN MORE NEED OF THAN YOU‚ÄÎSO MUCH FOR YOUR VANITY, BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT‚ÄÔS TRUE. I‚ÄÔVE COME TO BE OPEN WITH YOU FROM THIS TIME FORWARD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEN YOU HAVE NOT BEEN OPEN WITH ME BEFORE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU KNOW THAT YOURSELF. I‚ÄÔVE BEEN CUNNING WITH YOU MANY TIMES ‚Ä¶ YOU SMILE; I‚ÄÔM VERY GLAD OF THAT SMILE AS A PRELUDE TO OUR EXPLANATION. I PROVOKED THAT SMILE ON PURPOSE BY USING THE WORD ‚ÄÒCUNNING,‚ÄÔ SO THAT YOU MIGHT GET CROSS DIRECTLY AT MY DARING TO THINK I COULD BE CUNNING, SO THAT I MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE OF EXPLAINING MYSELF AT ONCE. YOU SEE, YOU SEE HOW OPEN I HAVE BECOME NOW! WELL, DO YOU CARE TO LISTEN?‚ÄÙ

IN THE EXPRESSION OF NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH‚ÄÔS FACE, WHICH WAS CONTEMPTUOUSLY COMPOSED, AND EVEN IRONICAL, IN SPITE OF HIS VISITOR‚ÄÔS OBVIOUS DESIRE TO IRRITATE HIM BY THE INSOLENCE OF HIS PREMEDITATED AND INTENTIONALLY COARSE NA√ØVET√©S, THERE WAS, AT LAST, A LOOK OF RATHER UNEASY CURIOSITY.

‚ÄÚLISTEN,‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WRIGGLING MORE THAN EVER, ‚ÄÚWHEN I SET OFF TO COME HERE, I MEAN HERE IN THE LARGE SENSE, TO THIS TOWN, TEN DAYS AGO, I MADE UP MY MIND, OF COURSE, TO ASSUME A CHARACTER. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BEST TO HAVE DONE WITHOUT ANYTHING, TO HAVE KEPT ONE‚ÄÔS OWN CHARACTER, WOULDN‚ÄÔT IT? THERE IS NO BETTER DODGE THAN ONE‚ÄÔS OWN CHARACTER, BECAUSE NO ONE BELIEVES IN IT. I MEANT, I MUST OWN, TO ASSUME THE PART OF A FOOL, BECAUSE IT IS EASIER TO BE A FOOL THAN TO ACT ONE‚ÄÔS OWN CHARACTER; BUT AS A FOOL IS AFTER ALL SOMETHING EXTREME, AND ANYTHING EXTREME EXCITES CURIOSITY, I ENDED BY STICKING TO MY OWN CHARACTER. AND WHAT IS MY OWN CHARACTER? THE GOLDEN MEAN: NEITHER WISE NOR FOOLISH, RATHER STUPID, AND DROPPED FROM THE MOON, AS SENSIBLE PEOPLE SAY HERE, ISN‚ÄÔT THAT IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPERHAPS IT IS,‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, WITH A FAINT SMILE.

‚ÄÚAH, YOU AGREE‚ÄÎI‚ÄÔM VERY GLAD; I KNEW BEFOREHAND THAT IT WAS YOUR OWN OPINION.‚Ä¶ YOU NEEDN‚ÄÔT TROUBLE, I AM NOT ANNOYED, AND I DIDN‚ÄÔT DESCRIBE MYSELF IN THAT WAY TO GET A FLATTERING CONTRADICTION FROM YOU‚ÄÎNO, YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT STUPID, YOU‚ÄÔRE CLEVER.‚Ä¶ AH! YOU‚ÄÔRE SMILING AGAIN!‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔVE BLUNDERED ONCE MORE. YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SAID ‚ÄÒYOU‚ÄÔRE CLEVER,‚ÄÔ GRANTED; I‚ÄÔLL LET IT PASS ANYWAY. PASSONS, AS PAPA SAYS, AND, IN PARENTHESIS, DON‚ÄÔT BE VEXED WITH MY VERBOSITY. BY THE WAY, I ALWAYS SAY A LOT, THAT IS, USE A GREAT MANY WORDS AND TALK VERY FAST, AND I NEVER SPEAK WELL. AND WHY DO I USE SO MANY WORDS, AND WHY DO I NEVER SPEAK WELL? BECAUSE I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HOW TO SPEAK. PEOPLE WHO CAN SPEAK WELL, SPEAK BRIEFLY. SO THAT I AM STUPID, AM I NOT? BUT AS THIS GIFT OF STUPIDITY IS NATURAL TO ME, WHY SHOULDN‚ÄÔT I MAKE SKILFUL USE OF IT? AND I DO MAKE USE OF IT. IT‚ÄÔS TRUE THAT AS I CAME HERE, I DID THINK, AT FIRST, OF BEING SILENT. BUT YOU KNOW SILENCE IS A GREAT TALENT, AND THEREFORE INCONGRUOUS FOR ME, AND SECONDLY SILENCE WOULD BE RISKY, ANYWAY. SO I MADE UP MY MIND FINALLY THAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO TALK, BUT TO TALK STUPIDLY‚ÄÎTHAT IS, TO TALK AND TALK AND TALK‚ÄÎTO BE IN A TREMENDOUS HURRY TO EXPLAIN THINGS, AND IN THE END TO GET MUDDLED IN MY OWN EXPLANATIONS, SO THAT MY LISTENER WOULD WALK AWAY WITHOUT HEARING THE END, WITH A SHRUG, OR, BETTER STILL, WITH A CURSE. YOU SUCCEED STRAIGHT OFF IN PERSUADING THEM OF YOUR SIMPLICITY, IN BORING THEM AND IN BEING INCOMPREHENSIBLE‚ÄÎTHREE ADVANTAGES ALL AT ONCE! DO YOU SUPPOSE ANYBODY WILL SUSPECT YOU OF MYSTERIOUS DESIGNS AFTER THAT? WHY, EVERY ONE OF THEM WOULD TAKE IT AS A PERSONAL AFFRONT IF ANYONE WERE TO SAY I HAD SECRET DESIGNS. AND I SOMETIMES AMUSE THEM TOO, AND THAT‚ÄÔS PRICELESS. WHY, THEY‚ÄÔRE READY TO FORGIVE ME EVERYTHING NOW, JUST BECAUSE THE CLEVER FELLOW WHO USED TO PUBLISH MANIFESTOES OUT THERE TURNS OUT TO BE STUPIDER THAN THEMSELVES‚ÄÎTHAT‚ÄÔS SO, ISN‚ÄÔT IT? FROM YOUR SMILE I SEE YOU APPROVE.‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS NOT SMILING AT ALL, HOWEVER.

ON THE CONTRARY, HE WAS LISTENING WITH A FROWN AND SOME IMPATIENCE.

‚ÄÚEH? WHAT? I BELIEVE YOU SAID ‚ÄÒNO MATTER.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH RATTLED ON. (NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAD SAID NOTHING AT ALL.) ‚ÄÚOF COURSE, OF COURSE. I ASSURE YOU I‚ÄÔM NOT HERE TO COMPROMISE YOU BY MY COMPANY, BY CLAIMING YOU AS MY COMRADE. BUT DO YOU KNOW YOU‚ÄÔRE HORRIBLY CAPTIOUS TO-DAY; I RAN IN TO YOU WITH A LIGHT AND OPEN HEART, AND YOU SEEM TO BE LAYING UP EVERY WORD I SAY AGAINST ME. I ASSURE YOU I‚ÄÔM NOT GOING TO BEGIN ABOUT ANYTHING SHOCKING TO-DAY, I GIVE YOU MY WORD, AND I AGREE BEFOREHAND TO ALL YOUR CONDITIONS.‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS OBSTINATELY SILENT.

‚ÄÚEH? WHAT? DID YOU SAY SOMETHING? I SEE, I SEE THAT I‚ÄÔVE MADE A BLUNDER AGAIN, IT SEEMS; YOU‚ÄÔVE NOT SUGGESTED CONDITIONS AND YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT GOING TO; I BELIEVE YOU, I BELIEVE YOU; WELL, YOU CAN SET YOUR MIND AT REST; I KNOW, OF COURSE, THAT IT‚ÄÔS NOT WORTH WHILE FOR ME TO SUGGEST THEM, IS IT? I‚ÄÔLL ANSWER FOR YOU BEFOREHAND, AND‚ÄÎJUST FROM STUPIDITY, OF COURSE; STUPIDITY AGAIN.‚Ä¶ YOU‚ÄÔRE LAUGHING? EH? WHAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOTHING,‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH LAUGHED AT LAST. ‚ÄÚI JUST REMEMBERED THAT I REALLY DID CALL YOU STUPID, BUT YOU WEREN‚ÄÔT THERE THEN, SO THEY MUST HAVE REPEATED IT.‚Ä¶ I WOULD ASK YOU TO MAKE HASTE AND COME TO THE POINT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, BUT I AM AT THE POINT! I AM TALKING ABOUT SUNDAY,‚ÄÙ BABBLED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. ‚ÄÚWHY, WHAT WAS I ON SUNDAY? WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT? JUST FUSSY, MEDIOCRE STUPIDITY, AND IN THE STUPIDEST WAY I TOOK POSSESSION OF THE CONVERSATION BY FORCE. BUT THEY FORGAVE ME EVERYTHING, FIRST BECAUSE I DROPPED FROM THE MOON, THAT SEEMS TO BE SETTLED HERE, NOW, BY EVERY ONE; AND, SECONDLY, BECAUSE I TOLD THEM A PRETTY LITTLE STORY, AND GOT YOU ALL OUT OF A SCRAPE, DIDN‚ÄÔT THEY, DIDN‚ÄÔT THEY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT IS, YOU TOLD YOUR STORY SO AS TO LEAVE THEM IN DOUBT AND SUGGEST SOME COMPACT AND COLLUSION BETWEEN US, WHEN THERE WAS NO COLLUSION AND I‚ÄÔD NOT ASKED YOU TO DO ANYTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚJUST SO, JUST SO!‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH CAUGHT HIM UP, APPARENTLY DELIGHTED. ‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS JUST WHAT I DID DO, FOR I WANTED YOU TO SEE THAT I IMPLIED IT; I EXERTED MYSELF CHIEFLY FOR YOUR SAKE, FOR I CAUGHT YOU AND WANTED TO COMPROMISE YOU, ABOVE ALL I WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW FAR YOU‚ÄÔRE AFRAID.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW WHY YOU ARE SO OPEN NOW?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT BE ANGRY, DON‚ÄÔT BE ANGRY, DON‚ÄÔT GLARE AT ME.‚Ä¶ YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT, THOUGH. YOU WONDER WHY I AM SO OPEN? WHY, JUST BECAUSE IT‚ÄÔS ALL CHANGED NOW; OF COURSE, IT‚ÄÔS OVER, BURIED UNDER THE SAND. I‚ÄÔVE SUDDENLY CHANGED MY IDEAS ABOUT YOU. THE OLD WAY IS CLOSED; NOW I SHALL NEVER COMPROMISE YOU IN THE OLD WAY, IT WILL BE IN A NEW WAY NOW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE CHANGED YOUR TACTICS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHERE ARE NO TACTICS. NOW IT‚ÄÔS FOR YOU TO DECIDE IN EVERYTHING, THAT IS, IF YOU WANT TO, SAY YES, AND IF YOU WANT TO, SAY NO. THERE YOU HAVE MY NEW TACTICS. AND I WON‚ÄÔT SAY A WORD ABOUT OUR CAUSE TILL YOU BID ME YOURSELF. YOU LAUGH? LAUGH AWAY. I‚ÄÔM LAUGHING MYSELF. BUT I‚ÄÔM IN EARNEST NOW, IN EARNEST, IN EARNEST, THOUGH A MAN WHO IS IN SUCH A HURRY IS STUPID, ISN‚ÄÔT HE? NEVER MIND, I MAY BE STUPID, BUT I‚ÄÔM IN EARNEST, IN EARNEST.‚ÄÙ

HE REALLY WAS SPEAKING IN EARNEST IN QUITE A DIFFERENT TONE, AND WITH A PECULIAR EXCITEMENT, SO THAT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH LOOKED AT HIM WITH CURIOSITY.

‚ÄÚYOU SAY YOU‚ÄÔVE CHANGED YOUR IDEAS ABOUT ME?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED.

‚ÄÚI CHANGED MY IDEAS ABOUT YOU AT THE MOMENT WHEN YOU DREW YOUR HANDS BACK AFTER SHATOV‚ÄÔS ATTACK, AND, THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH, THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH, NO QUESTIONS, PLEASE, I‚ÄÔLL SAY NOTHING MORE NOW.‚ÄÙ

HE JUMPED UP, WAVING HIS HANDS AS THOUGH WAVING OFF QUESTIONS. BUT AS THERE WERE NO QUESTIONS, AND HE HAD NO REASON TO GO AWAY, HE SANK INTO AN ARM-CHAIR AGAIN, SOMEWHAT REASSURED.

‚ÄÚBY THE WAY, IN PARENTHESIS,‚ÄÙ HE RATTLED ON AT ONCE, ‚ÄÚSOME PEOPLE HERE ARE BABBLING THAT YOU‚ÄÔLL KILL HIM, AND TAKING BETS ABOUT IT, SO THAT LEMBKE POSITIVELY THOUGHT OF SETTING THE POLICE ON, BUT YULIA MIHAILOVNA FORBADE IT.‚Ä¶ BUT ENOUGH ABOUT THAT, QUITE ENOUGH, I ONLY SPOKE OF IT TO LET YOU KNOW. BY THE WAY, I MOVED THE LEBYADKINS THE SAME DAY, YOU KNOW; DID YOU GET MY NOTE WITH THEIR ADDRESS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI RECEIVED IT AT THE TIME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DIDN‚ÄÔT DO THAT BY WAY OF ‚ÄÒSTUPIDITY.‚ÄÔ I DID IT GENUINELY, TO SERVE YOU. IF IT WAS STUPID, ANYWAY, IT WAS DONE IN GOOD FAITH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, ALL RIGHT, PERHAPS IT WAS NECESSARY.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH DREAMILY, ‚ÄÚONLY DON‚ÄÔT WRITE ANY MORE LETTERS TO ME, I BEG YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID IT. IT WAS ONLY ONE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSO LIPUTIN KNOWS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIMPOSSIBLE TO HELP IT: BUT LIPUTIN, YOU KNOW YOURSELF, DARE NOT ‚Ä¶ BY THE WAY, YOU OUGHT TO MEET OUR FELLOWS, THAT IS, THE FELLOWS NOT OUR FELLOWS, OR YOU‚ÄÔLL BE FINDING FAULT AGAIN. DON‚ÄÔT DISTURB YOURSELF, NOT JUST NOW, BUT SOMETIME. JUST NOW IT‚ÄÔS RAINING. I‚ÄÔLL LET THEM KNOW, THEY‚ÄÔLL MEET TOGETHER, AND WE‚ÄÔLL GO IN THE EVENING. THEY‚ÄÔRE WAITING, WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN LIKE YOUNG CROWS IN A NEST, TO SEE WHAT PRESENT WE‚ÄÔVE BROUGHT THEM. THEY‚ÄÔRE A HOT-HEADED LOT. THEY‚ÄÔVE BROUGHT OUT LEAFLETS, THEY‚ÄÔRE ON THE POINT OF QUARRELLING. VIRGINSKY IS A UNIVERSAL HUMANITY MAN, LIPUTIN IS A FOURIERIST WITH A MARKED INCLINATION FOR POLICE WORK; A MAN, I ASSURE YOU, WHO IS PRECIOUS FROM ONE POINT OF VIEW, THOUGH HE REQUIRES STRICT SUPERVISION IN ALL OTHERS; AND, LAST OF ALL, THAT FELLOW WITH THE LONG EARS, HE‚ÄÔLL READ AN ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN SYSTEM. AND DO YOU KNOW, THEY‚ÄÔRE OFFENDED AT MY TREATING THEM CASUALLY, AND THROWING COLD WATER OVER THEM, BUT WE CERTAINLY MUST MEET.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE MADE ME OUT SOME SORT OF CHIEF?‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH DROPPED AS CARELESSLY AS POSSIBLE.

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH LOOKED QUICKLY AT HIM.

‚ÄÚBY THE WAY,‚ÄÙ HE INTERPOSED, IN HASTE TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT, AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT HEARD. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE BEEN HERE TWO OR THREE TIMES, YOU KNOW, TO SEE HER EXCELLENCY, VARVARA PETROVNA, AND I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO SAY A GREAT DEAL TOO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSO I IMAGINE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, DON‚ÄÔT IMAGINE, I‚ÄÔVE SIMPLY TOLD HER THAT YOU WON‚ÄÔT KILL HIM, WELL, AND OTHER SWEET THINGS. AND ONLY FANCY; THE VERY NEXT DAY SHE KNEW I‚ÄÔD MOVED MARYA TIMOFYEVNA BEYOND THE RIVER. WAS IT YOU TOLD HER?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI NEVER DREAMED OF IT!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNEW IT WASN‚ÄÔT YOU. WHO ELSE COULD IT BE? IT‚ÄÔS INTERESTING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLIPUTIN, OF COURSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚN-NO, NOT LIPUTIN,‚ÄÙ MUTTERED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, FROWNING; ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL FIND OUT WHO. IT‚ÄÔS MORE LIKE SHATOV.‚Ä¶ THAT‚ÄÔS NONSENSE THOUGH. LET‚ÄÔS LEAVE THAT! THOUGH IT‚ÄÔS AWFULLY IMPORTANT.‚Ä¶ BY THE WAY, I KEPT EXPECTING THAT YOUR MOTHER WOULD SUDDENLY BURST OUT WITH THE GREAT QUESTION.‚Ä¶ ACH! YES, SHE WAS HORRIBLY GLUM AT FIRST, BUT SUDDENLY, WHEN I CAME TO-DAY, SHE WAS BEAMING ALL OVER, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS BECAUSE I PROMISED HER TO-DAY THAT WITHIN FIVE DAYS I‚ÄÔLL BE ENGAGED TO LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA,‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SAID WITH SURPRISING OPENNESS.

‚ÄÚOH!‚Ä¶ YES, OF COURSE,‚ÄÙ FALTERED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, SEEMING DISCONCERTED. ‚ÄÚTHERE ARE RUMOURS OF HER ENGAGEMENT, YOU KNOW. IT‚ÄÔS TRUE, TOO. BUT YOU‚ÄÔRE RIGHT, SHE‚ÄÔD RUN FROM UNDER THE WEDDING CROWN, YOU‚ÄÔVE ONLY TO CALL TO HER. YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT ANGRY AT MY SAYING SO?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, I‚ÄÔM NOT ANGRY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI NOTICE IT‚ÄÔS AWFULLY HARD TO MAKE YOU ANGRY TO-DAY, AND I BEGIN TO BE AFRAID OF YOU. I‚ÄÔM AWFULLY CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW YOU‚ÄÔLL APPEAR TO-MORROW. I EXPECT YOU‚ÄÔVE GOT A LOT OF THINGS READY. YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT ANGRY AT MY SAYING SO?‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH MADE NO ANSWER AT ALL, WHICH COMPLETED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS IRRITATION.

‚ÄÚBY THE WAY, DID YOU SAY THAT IN EARNEST TO YOUR MOTHER, ABOUT LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED.

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH LOOKED COLDLY AT HIM.

‚ÄÚOH, I UNDERSTAND, IT WAS ONLY TO SOOTHE HER, OF COURSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND IF IT WERE IN EARNEST?‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH ASKED FIRMLY.

‚ÄÚOH, GOD BLESS YOU THEN, AS THEY SAY IN SUCH CASES. IT WON‚ÄÔT HINDER THE CAUSE (YOU SEE, I DON‚ÄÔT SAY ‚ÄÒOUR,‚ÄÔ YOU DON‚ÄÔT LIKE THE WORD ‚ÄÒOUR‚ÄÔ) AND I ‚Ä¶ WELL, I ‚Ä¶ AM AT YOUR SERVICE, AS YOU KNOW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU THINK SO?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI THINK NOTHING‚ÄÎNOTHING,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HURRIEDLY DECLARED, LAUGHING, ‚ÄÚBECAUSE I KNOW YOU CONSIDER WHAT YOU‚ÄÔRE ABOUT BEFOREHAND FOR YOURSELF, AND EVERYTHING WITH YOU HAS BEEN THOUGHT OUT. I ONLY MEAN THAT I AM SERIOUSLY AT YOUR SERVICE, ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE, AND IN EVERY SORT OF CIRCUMSTANCE, EVERY SORT REALLY, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH YAWNED.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE BORED YOU,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH CRIED, JUMPING UP SUDDENLY, AND SNATCHING HIS PERFECTLY NEW ROUND HAT AS THOUGH HE WERE GOING AWAY. HE REMAINED AND WENT ON TALKING, HOWEVER, THOUGH HE STOOD UP, SOMETIMES PACING ABOUT THE ROOM AND TAPPING HIMSELF ON THE KNEE WITH HIS HAT AT EXCITING PARTS OF THE CONVERSATION.

‚ÄÚI MEANT TO AMUSE YOU WITH STORIES OF THE LEMBKES, TOO,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED GAILY.

‚ÄÚAFTERWARDS, PERHAPS, NOT NOW. BUT HOW IS YULIA MIHAILOVNA?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT CONVENTIONAL MANNERS ALL OF YOU HAVE! HER HEALTH IS NO MORE TO YOU THAN THE HEALTH OF THE GREY CAT, YET YOU ASK AFTER IT. I APPROVE OF THAT. SHE‚ÄÔS QUITE WELL, AND HER RESPECT FOR YOU AMOUNTS TO A SUPERSTITION, HER IMMENSE ANTICIPATIONS OF YOU AMOUNT TO A SUPERSTITION. SHE DOES NOT SAY A WORD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON SUNDAY, AND IS CONVINCED THAT YOU WILL OVERCOME EVERYTHING YOURSELF BY MERELY MAKING YOUR APPEARANCE. UPON MY WORD! SHE FANCIES YOU CAN DO ANYTHING. YOU‚ÄÔRE AN ENIGMATIC AND ROMANTIC FIGURE NOW, MORE THAN EVER YOU WERE‚ÄÎEXTREMELY ADVANTAGEOUS POSITION. IT IS INCREDIBLE HOW EAGER EVERY ONE IS TO SEE YOU. THEY WERE PRETTY HOT WHEN I WENT AWAY, BUT NOW IT IS MORE SO THAN EVER. THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR LETTER. THEY ARE ALL AFRAID OF COUNT K. DO YOU KNOW THEY LOOK UPON YOU AS A SPY? I KEEP THAT UP, YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT ANGRY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT DOES NOT MATTER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT DOES NOT MATTER; IT‚ÄÔS ESSENTIAL IN THE LONG RUN. THEY HAVE THEIR WAYS OF DOING THINGS HERE. I ENCOURAGE IT, OF COURSE; YULIA MIHAILOVNA, IN THE FIRST PLACE, GAGANOV TOO.‚Ä¶ YOU LAUGH? BUT YOU KNOW I HAVE MY POLICY; I BABBLE AWAY AND SUDDENLY I SAY SOMETHING CLEVER JUST AS THEY ARE ON THE LOOK-OUT FOR IT. THEY CROWD ROUND ME AND I HUMBUG AWAY AGAIN. THEY‚ÄÔVE ALL GIVEN ME UP IN DESPAIR BY NOW: ‚ÄÒHE‚ÄÔS GOT BRAINS BUT HE‚ÄÔS DROPPED FROM THE MOON.‚ÄÔ LEMBKE INVITES ME TO ENTER THE SERVICE SO THAT I MAY BE REFORMED. YOU KNOW I TREAT HIM MOCKINGLY, THAT IS, I COMPROMISE HIM AND HE SIMPLY STARES. YULIA MIHAILOVNA ENCOURAGES IT. OH, BY THE WAY, GAGANOV IS IN AN AWFUL RAGE WITH YOU. HE SAID THE NASTIEST THINGS ABOUT YOU YESTERDAY AT DUHOVO. I TOLD HIM THE WHOLE TRUTH ON THE SPOT, THAT IS, OF COURSE, NOT THE WHOLE TRUTH. I SPENT THE WHOLE DAY AT DUHOVO. IT‚ÄÔS A SPLENDID ESTATE, A FINE HOUSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEN IS HE AT DUHOVO NOW?‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH BROKE IN SUDDENLY, MAKING A SUDDEN START FORWARD AND ALMOST LEAPING UP FROM HIS SEAT.

‚ÄÚNO, HE DROVE ME HERE THIS MORNING, WE RETURNED TOGETHER,‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, APPEARING NOT TO NOTICE STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS MOMENTARY EXCITEMENT. ‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THIS? I DROPPED A BOOK.‚ÄÙ HE BENT DOWN TO PICK UP THE ‚ÄÚKEEPSAKE‚ÄÙ HE HAD KNOCKED DOWN. ‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒTHE WOMEN OF BALZAC,‚ÄÔ WITH ILLUSTRATIONS.‚ÄÙ HE OPENED IT SUDDENLY. ‚ÄÚI HAVEN‚ÄÔT READ IT. LEMBKE WRITES NOVELS TOO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES?‚ÄÙ QUERIED NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, AS THOUGH BEGINNING TO BE INTERESTED.

‚ÄÚIN RUSSIAN, ON THE SLY, OF COURSE, YULIA MIHAILOVNA KNOWS AND ALLOWS IT. HE‚ÄÔS HENPECKED, BUT WITH GOOD MANNERS; IT‚ÄÔS THEIR SYSTEM. SUCH STRICT FORM‚ÄÎSUCH SELF-RESTRAINT! SOMETHING OF THE SORT WOULD BE THE THING FOR US.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU APPROVE OF GOVERNMENT METHODS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SHOULD RATHER THINK SO! IT‚ÄÔS THE ONE THING THAT‚ÄÔS NATURAL AND PRACTICABLE IN RUSSIA.‚Ä¶ I WON‚ÄÔT ‚Ä¶ I WON‚ÄÔT,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED OUT SUDDENLY, ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM NOT REFERRING TO THAT‚ÄÎNOT A WORD ON DELICATE SUBJECTS. GOOD-BYE, THOUGH, YOU LOOK RATHER GREEN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM FEVERISH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI CAN WELL BELIEVE IT; YOU SHOULD GO TO BED. BY THE WAY, THERE ARE SKOPTSI HERE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD‚ÄÎTHEY‚ÄÔRE CURIOUS PEOPLE ‚Ä¶ OF THAT LATER, THOUGH. AH, HERE‚ÄÔS ANOTHER ANECDOTE. THERE‚ÄÔS AN INFANTRY REGIMENT HERE IN THE DISTRICT. I WAS DRINKING LAST FRIDAY EVENING WITH THE OFFICERS. WE‚ÄÔVE THREE FRIENDS AMONG THEM, VOUS COMPRENEZ? THEY WERE DISCUSSING ATHEISM AND I NEED HARDLY SAY THEY MADE SHORT WORK OF GOD. THEY WERE SQUEALING WITH DELIGHT. BY THE WAY, SHATOV DECLARES THAT IF THERE‚ÄÔS TO BE A RISING IN RUSSIA WE MUST BEGIN WITH ATHEISM. MAYBE IT‚ÄÔS TRUE. ONE GRIZZLED OLD STAGER OF A CAPTAIN SAT MUM, NOT SAYING A WORD. ALL AT ONCE HE STANDS UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND SAYS ALOUD, AS THOUGH SPEAKING TO HIMSELF: ‚ÄÒIF THERE‚ÄÔS NO GOD, HOW CAN I BE A CAPTAIN THEN?‚ÄÔ HE TOOK UP HIS CAP AND WENT OUT, FLINGING UP HIS HANDS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE EXPRESSED A RATHER SENSIBLE IDEA,‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, YAWNING FOR THE THIRD TIME.

‚ÄÚYES? I DIDN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND IT; I MEANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT IT. WELL WHAT ELSE HAVE I TO TELL YOU? THE SHPIGULIN FACTORY‚ÄÔS INTERESTING; AS YOU KNOW, THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED WORKMEN IN IT, IT‚ÄÔS A HOTBED OF CHOLERA, IT‚ÄÔS NOT BEEN CLEANED FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND THE FACTORY HANDS ARE SWINDLED. THE OWNERS ARE MILLIONAIRES. I ASSURE YOU THAT SOME AMONG THE HANDS HAVE AN IDEA OF THE INTERNATIONALE. WHAT, YOU SMILE? YOU‚ÄÔLL SEE‚ÄÎONLY GIVE ME EVER SO LITTLE TIME! I‚ÄÔVE ASKED YOU TO FIX THE TIME ALREADY AND NOW I ASK YOU AGAIN AND THEN.‚Ä¶ BUT I BEG YOUR PARDON, I WON‚ÄÔT, I WON‚ÄÔT SPEAK OF THAT, DON‚ÄÔT FROWN. THERE!‚ÄÙ HE TURNED BACK SUDDENLY. ‚ÄÚI QUITE FORGOT THE CHIEF THING. I WAS TOLD JUST NOW THAT OUR BOX HAD COME FROM PETERSBURG.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU MEAN ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH LOOKED AT HIM, NOT UNDERSTANDING.

‚ÄÚYOUR BOX, YOUR THINGS, COATS, TROUSERS, AND LINEN HAVE COME. IS IT TRUE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES ‚Ä¶ THEY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT IT THIS MORNING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚACH, THEN CAN‚ÄÔT I OPEN IT AT ONCE!‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚASK ALEXEY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, TO-MORROW, THEN, WILL TO-MORROW DO? YOU SEE MY NEW JACKET, DRESS-COAT AND THREE PAIRS OF TROUSERS ARE WITH YOUR THINGS, FROM SHARMER‚ÄÔS, BY YOUR RECOMMENDATION, DO YOU REMEMBER?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI HEAR YOU‚ÄÔRE GOING IN FOR BEING A GENTLEMAN HERE,‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WITH A SMILE. ‚ÄÚIS IT TRUE YOU‚ÄÔRE GOING TO TAKE LESSONS AT THE RIDING SCHOOL?‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SMILED A WRY SMILE. ‚ÄÚI SAY,‚ÄÙ HE SAID SUDDENLY, WITH EXCESSIVE HASTE IN A VOICE THAT QUIVERED AND FALTERED, ‚ÄÚI SAY, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, LET‚ÄÔS DROP PERSONALITIES ONCE FOR ALL. OF COURSE, YOU CAN DESPISE ME AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE IF IT AMUSES YOU‚ÄÎBUT WE‚ÄÔD BETTER DISPENSE WITH PERSONALITIES FOR A TIME, HADN‚ÄÔT WE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚALL RIGHT,‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH ASSENTED.

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH GRINNED, TAPPED HIS KNEE WITH HIS HAT, SHIFTED FROM ONE LEG TO THE OTHER, AND RECOVERED HIS FORMER EXPRESSION.

‚ÄÚSOME PEOPLE HERE POSITIVELY LOOK UPON ME AS YOUR RIVAL WITH LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA, SO I MUST THINK OF MY APPEARANCE, MUSTN‚ÄÔT I,‚ÄÙ HE LAUGHED. ‚ÄÚWHO WAS IT TOLD YOU THAT THOUGH? H‚ÄÔM. IT‚ÄÔS JUST EIGHT O‚ÄÔCLOCK; WELL I MUST BE OFF. I PROMISED TO LOOK IN ON VARVARA PETROVNA, BUT I SHALL MAKE MY ESCAPE. AND YOU GO TO BED AND YOU‚ÄÔLL BE STRONGER TO-MORROW. IT‚ÄÔS RAINING AND DARK, BUT I‚ÄÔVE A CAB, IT‚ÄÔS NOT OVER SAFE IN THE STREETS HERE AT NIGHT.‚Ä¶ ACH, BY THE WAY, THERE‚ÄÔS A RUN-AWAY CONVICT FROM SIBERIA, FEDKA, WANDERING ABOUT THE TOWN AND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD. ONLY FANCY, HE USED TO BE A SERF OF MINE, AND MY PAPA SENT HIM FOR A SOLDIER FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND TOOK THE MONEY FOR HIM. HE‚ÄÔS A VERY REMARKABLE PERSON.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU HAVE BEEN TALKING TO HIM?‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SCANNED HIM.

‚ÄÚI HAVE. HE LETS ME KNOW WHERE HE IS. HE‚ÄÔS READY FOR ANYTHING, ANYTHING, FOR MONEY OF COURSE, BUT HE HAS CONVICTIONS, TOO, OF A SORT, OF COURSE. OH YES, BY THE WAY, AGAIN, IF YOU MEANT ANYTHING OF THAT PLAN, YOU REMEMBER, ABOUT LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA, I TELL YOU ONCE AGAIN, I TOO AM A FELLOW READY FOR ANYTHING OF ANY KIND YOU LIKE, AND ABSOLUTELY AT YOUR SERVICE.‚Ä¶ HULLO! ARE YOU REACHING FOR YOUR STICK. OH NO ‚Ä¶ ONLY FANCY ‚Ä¶ I THOUGHT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR YOUR STICK.‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS LOOKING FOR NOTHING AND SAID NOTHING.

BUT HE HAD RISEN TO HIS FEET VERY SUDDENLY WITH A STRANGE LOOK IN HIS FACE.

‚ÄÚIF YOU WANT ANY HELP ABOUT MR. GAGANOV EITHER,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH BLURTED OUT SUDDENLY, THIS TIME LOOKING STRAIGHT AT THE PAPER-WEIGHT, ‚ÄÚOF COURSE I CAN ARRANGE IT ALL, AND I‚ÄÔM CERTAIN YOU WON‚ÄÔT BE ABLE TO MANAGE WITHOUT ME.‚ÄÙ

HE WENT OUT SUDDENLY WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER, BUT THRUST HIS HEAD IN AT THE DOOR ONCE MORE. ‚ÄÚI MENTION THAT,‚ÄÙ HE GABBLED HURRIEDLY, ‚ÄÚBECAUSE SHATOV HAD NO RIGHT EITHER, YOU KNOW, TO RISK HIS LIFE LAST SUNDAY WHEN HE ATTACKED YOU, HAD HE? I SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU WOULD MAKE A NOTE OF THAT.‚ÄÙ HE DISAPPEARED AGAIN WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER.

IV

PERHAPS HE IMAGINED, AS HE MADE HIS EXIT, THAT AS SOON AS HE WAS LEFT ALONE, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WOULD BEGIN BEATING ON THE WALL WITH HIS FISTS, AND NO DOUBT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO SEE THIS, IF THAT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE. BUT, IF SO, HE WAS GREATLY MISTAKEN. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS STILL CALM. HE REMAINED STANDING FOR TWO MINUTES IN THE SAME POSITION BY THE TABLE, APPARENTLY PLUNGED IN THOUGHT, BUT SOON A COLD AND LISTLESS SMILE CAME ON TO HIS LIPS. HE SLOWLY SAT DOWN AGAIN IN THE SAME PLACE IN THE CORNER OF THE SOFA, AND SHUT HIS EYES AS THOUGH FROM WEARINESS. THE CORNER OF THE LETTER WAS STILL PEEPING FROM UNDER THE PAPERWEIGHT, BUT HE DIDN‚ÄÔT EVEN MOVE TO COVER IT.

HE SOON SANK INTO COMPLETE FORGETFULNESS.

WHEN PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WENT OUT WITHOUT COMING TO SEE HER, AS HE HAD PROMISED, VARVARA PETROVNA, WHO HAD BEEN WORN OUT BY ANXIETY DURING THESE DAYS, COULD NOT CONTROL HERSELF, AND VENTURED TO VISIT HER SON HERSELF, THOUGH IT WAS NOT HER REGULAR TIME. SHE WAS STILL HAUNTED BY THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD TELL HER SOMETHING CONCLUSIVE. SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR GENTLY AS BEFORE, AND AGAIN RECEIVING NO ANSWER, SHE OPENED THE DOOR. SEEING THAT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS SITTING STRANGELY MOTIONLESS, SHE CAUTIOUSLY ADVANCED TO THE SOFA WITH A THROBBING HEART. SHE SEEMED STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT HE COULD FALL ASLEEP SO QUICKLY AND THAT HE COULD SLEEP SITTING LIKE THAT, SO ERECT AND MOTIONLESS, SO THAT HIS BREATHING EVEN WAS SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE. HIS FACE WAS PALE AND FORBIDDING, BUT IT LOOKED, AS IT WERE, NUMB AND RIGID. HIS BROWS WERE SOMEWHAT CONTRACTED AND FROWNING. HE POSITIVELY HAD THE LOOK OF A LIFELESS WAX FIGURE. SHE STOOD OVER HIM FOR ABOUT THREE MINUTES, ALMOST HOLDING HER BREATH, AND SUDDENLY SHE WAS SEIZED WITH TERROR. SHE WITHDREW ON TIPTOE, STOPPED AT THE DOOR, HURRIEDLY MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER HIM, AND RETREATED UNOBSERVED, WITH A NEW OPPRESSION AND A NEW ANGUISH AT HER HEART.

HE SLEPT A LONG WHILE, MORE THAN AN HOUR, AND STILL IN THE SAME RIGID POSE: NOT A MUSCLE OF HIS FACE TWITCHED, THERE WAS NOT THE FAINTEST MOVEMENT IN HIS WHOLE BODY, AND HIS BROWS WERE STILL CONTRACTED IN THE SAME FORBIDDING FROWN. IF VARVARA PETROVNA HAD REMAINED ANOTHER THREE MINUTES SHE COULD NOT HAVE ENDURED THE STIFLING SENSATION THAT THIS MOTIONLESS LETHARGY ROUSED IN HER, AND WOULD HAVE WAKED HIM. BUT HE SUDDENLY OPENED HIS EYES, AND SAT FOR TEN MINUTES AS IMMOVABLE AS BEFORE, STARING PERSISTENTLY AND CURIOUSLY, AS THOUGH AT SOME OBJECT IN THE CORNER WHICH HAD STRUCK HIM, ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NOTHING NEW OR STRIKING IN THE ROOM.

SUDDENLY THERE RANG OUT THE LOW DEEP NOTE OF THE CLOCK ON THE WALL.

WITH SOME UNEASINESS HE TURNED TO LOOK AT IT, BUT ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT THE OTHER DOOR OPENED, AND THE BUTLER, ALEXEY YEGORYTCH CAME IN. HE HAD IN ONE HAND A GREATCOAT, A SCARF, AND A HAT, AND IN THE OTHER A SILVER TRAY WITH A NOTE ON IT.

‚ÄÚHALF-PAST NINE,‚ÄÙ HE ANNOUNCED SOFTLY, AND LAYING THE OTHER THINGS ON A CHAIR, HE HELD OUT THE TRAY WITH THE NOTE‚ÄÎA SCRAP OF PAPER UNSEALED AND SCRIBBLED IN PENCIL. GLANCING THROUGH IT, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH TOOK A PENCIL FROM THE TABLE, ADDED A FEW WORDS, AND PUT THE NOTE BACK ON THE TRAY.

‚ÄÚTAKE IT BACK AS SOON AS I HAVE GONE OUT, AND NOW DRESS ME,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, GETTING UP FROM THE SOFA.

NOTICING THAT HE HAD ON A LIGHT VELVET JACKET, HE THOUGHT A MINUTE, AND TOLD THE MAN TO BRING HIM A CLOTH COAT, WHICH HE WORE ON MORE CEREMONIOUS OCCASIONS. AT LAST, WHEN HE WAS DRESSED AND HAD PUT ON HIS HAT, HE LOCKED THE DOOR BY WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD COME INTO THE ROOM, TOOK THE LETTER FROM UNDER THE PAPERWEIGHT, AND WITHOUT SAYING A WORD WENT OUT INTO THE CORRIDOR, FOLLOWED BY ALEXEY YEGORYTCH. FROM THE CORRIDOR THEY WENT DOWN THE NARROW STONE STEPS OF THE BACK STAIRS TO A PASSAGE WHICH OPENED STRAIGHT INTO THE GARDEN. IN THE CORNER STOOD A LANTERN AND A BIG UMBRELLA.

‚ÄÚOWING TO THE EXCESSIVE RAIN THE MUD IN THE STREETS IS BEYOND ANYTHING,‚ÄÙ ALEXEY YEGORYTCH ANNOUNCED, MAKING A FINAL EFFORT TO DETER HIS MASTER FROM THE EXPEDITION. BUT OPENING HIS UMBRELLA THE LATTER WENT WITHOUT A WORD INTO THE DAMP AND SODDEN GARDEN, WHICH WAS DARK AS A CELLAR. THE WIND WAS ROARING AND TOSSING THE BARE TREE-TOPS. THE LITTLE SANDY PATHS WERE WET AND SLIPPERY. ALEXEY YEGORYTCH WALKED ALONG AS HE WAS, BAREHEADED, IN HIS SWALLOW-TAIL COAT, LIGHTING UP THE PATH FOR ABOUT THREE STEPS BEFORE THEM WITH THE LANTERN.

‚ÄÚWON‚ÄÔT IT BE NOTICED?‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH ASKED SUDDENLY.

‚ÄÚNOT FROM THE WINDOWS. BESIDES I HAVE SEEN TO ALL THAT ALREADY,‚ÄÙ THE OLD SERVANT ANSWERED IN QUIET AND MEASURED TONES.

‚ÄÚHAS MY MOTHER RETIRED?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHER EXCELLENCY LOCKED HERSELF IN AT NINE O‚ÄÔCLOCK AS SHE HAS DONE THE LAST FEW DAYS, AND THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF HER KNOWING ANYTHING. AT WHAT HOUR AM I TO EXPECT YOUR HONOUR?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAT ONE OR HALF-PAST, NOT LATER THAN TWO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, SIR.‚ÄÙ

CROSSING THE GARDEN BY THE WINDING PATHS THAT THEY BOTH KNEW BY HEART, THEY REACHED THE STONE WALL, AND THERE IN THE FARTHEST CORNER FOUND A LITTLE DOOR, WHICH LED OUT INTO A NARROW AND DESERTED LANE, AND WAS ALWAYS KEPT LOCKED. IT APPEARED THAT ALEXEY YEGORYTCH HAD THE KEY IN HIS HAND.

‚ÄÚWON‚ÄÔT THE DOOR CREAK?‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH INQUIRED AGAIN.

BUT ALEXEY YEGORYTCH INFORMED HIM THAT IT HAD BEEN OILED YESTERDAY ‚ÄÚAS WELL AS TO-DAY.‚ÄÙ HE WAS BY NOW WET THROUGH. UNLOCKING THE DOOR HE GAVE THE KEY TO NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH.

‚ÄÚIF IT SHOULD BE YOUR PLEASURE TO BE TAKING A DISTANT WALK, I WOULD WARN YOUR HONOUR THAT I AM NOT CONFIDENT OF THE FOLK HERE, ESPECIALLY IN THE BACK LANES, AND ESPECIALLY BEYOND THE RIVER,‚ÄÙ HE COULD NOT RESIST WARNING HIM AGAIN. HE WAS AN OLD SERVANT, WHO HAD BEEN LIKE A NURSE TO NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, AND AT ONE TIME USED TO DANDLE HIM IN HIS ARMS; HE WAS A GRAVE AND SEVERE MAN WHO WAS FOND OF LISTENING TO RELIGIOUS DISCOURSE AND READING BOOKS OF DEVOTION.

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT BE UNEASY, ALEXEY YEGORYTCH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMAY GOD‚ÄÔS BLESSING REST ON YOU, SIR, BUT ONLY IN YOUR RIGHTEOUS UNDERTAKINGS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT?‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, STOPPING SHORT IN THE LANE.

ALEXEY YEGORYTCH RESOLUTELY REPEATED HIS WORDS. HE HAD NEVER BEFORE VENTURED TO EXPRESS HIMSELF IN SUCH LANGUAGE IN HIS MASTER‚ÄÔS PRESENCE.

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH LOCKED THE DOOR, PUT THE KEY IN HIS POCKET, AND CROSSED THE LANE, SINKING FIVE OR SIX INCHES INTO THE MUD AT EVERY STEP. HE CAME OUT AT LAST INTO A LONG DESERTED STREET. HE KNEW THE TOWN LIKE THE FIVE FINGERS OF HIS HAND, BUT BOGOYAVLENSKY STREET WAS A LONG WAY OFF. IT WAS PAST TEN WHEN HE STOPPED AT LAST BEFORE THE LOCKED GATES OF THE DARK OLD HOUSE THAT BELONGED TO FILIPOV. THE GROUND FLOOR HAD STOOD EMPTY SINCE THE LEBYADKINS HAD LEFT IT, AND THE WINDOWS WERE BOARDED UP, BUT THERE WAS A LIGHT BURNING IN SHATOV‚ÄÔS ROOM ON THE SECOND FLOOR. AS THERE WAS NO BELL HE BEGAN BANGING ON THE GATE WITH HIS HAND. A WINDOW WAS OPENED AND SHATOV PEEPED OUT INTO THE STREET. IT WAS TERRIBLY DARK, AND DIFFICULT TO MAKE OUT ANYTHING. SHATOV WAS PEERING OUT FOR SOME TIME, ABOUT A MINUTE.

‚ÄÚIS THAT YOU?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED SUDDENLY.

‚ÄÚYES,‚ÄÙ REPLIED THE UNINVITED GUEST.

SHATOV SLAMMED THE WINDOW, WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND OPENED THE GATE. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH STEPPED OVER THE HIGH SILL, AND WITHOUT A WORD PASSED BY HIM STRAIGHT INTO KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS LODGE.

V

THERE EVERYTHING WAS UNLOCKED AND ALL THE DOORS STOOD OPEN. THE PASSAGE AND THE FIRST TWO ROOMS WERE DARK, BUT THERE WAS A LIGHT SHINING IN THE LAST, IN WHICH KIRILLOV LIVED AND DRANK TEA, AND LAUGHTER AND STRANGE CRIES CAME FROM IT. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WENT TOWARDS THE LIGHT, BUT STOOD STILL IN THE DOORWAY WITHOUT GOING IN. THERE WAS TEA ON THE TABLE. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM STOOD THE OLD WOMAN WHO WAS A RELATION OF THE LANDLORD. SHE WAS BAREHEADED AND WAS DRESSED IN A PETTICOAT AND A HARE-SKIN JACKET, AND HER STOCKINGLESS FEET WERE THRUST INTO SLIPPERS. IN HER ARMS SHE HAD AN EIGHTEEN-MONTHS-OLD BABY, WITH NOTHING ON BUT ITS LITTLE SHIRT; WITH BARE LEGS, FLUSHED CHEEKS, AND RUFFLED WHITE HAIR. IT HAD ONLY JUST BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE CRADLE. IT SEEMED TO HAVE JUST BEEN CRYING; THERE WERE STILL TEARS IN ITS EYES. BUT AT THAT INSTANT IT WAS STRETCHING OUT ITS LITTLE ARMS, CLAPPING ITS HANDS, AND LAUGHING WITH A SOB AS LITTLE CHILDREN DO. KIRILLOV WAS BOUNCING A BIG RED INDIA-RUBBER BALL ON THE FLOOR BEFORE IT. THE BALL BOUNCED UP TO THE CEILING, AND BACK TO THE FLOOR, THE BABY SHRIEKED ‚ÄÚBAW! BAW!‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV CAUGHT THE ‚ÄÚBAW‚ÄÙ, AND GAVE IT TO IT. THE BABY THREW IT ITSELF WITH ITS AWKWARD LITTLE HANDS, AND KIRILLOV RAN TO PICK IT UP AGAIN.

AT LAST THE ‚ÄÚBAW‚ÄÙ ROLLED UNDER THE CUPBOARD. ‚ÄÚBAW! BAW!‚ÄÙ CRIED THE CHILD. KIRILLOV LAY DOWN ON THE FLOOR, TRYING TO REACH THE BALL WITH HIS HAND UNDER THE CUPBOARD. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WENT INTO THE ROOM. THE BABY CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM, NESTLED AGAINST THE OLD WOMAN, AND WENT OFF INTO A PROLONGED INFANTILE WAIL. THE WOMAN IMMEDIATELY CARRIED IT OUT OF THE ROOM.

‚ÄÚSTAVROGIN?‚ÄÙ SAID KIRILLOV, BEGINNING TO GET UP FROM THE FLOOR WITH THE BALL IN HIS HAND, AND SHOWING NO SURPRISE AT THE UNEXPECTED VISIT. ‚ÄÚWILL YOU HAVE TEA?‚ÄÙ

HE ROSE TO HIS FEET.

‚ÄÚI SHOULD BE VERY GLAD OF IT, IF IT‚ÄÔS HOT,‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH; ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM WET THROUGH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS HOT, NEARLY BOILING IN FACT,‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV DECLARED DELIGHTED. ‚ÄÚSIT DOWN. YOU‚ÄÔRE MUDDY, BUT THAT‚ÄÔS NOTHING; I‚ÄÔLL MOP UP THE FLOOR LATER.‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SAT DOWN AND EMPTIED THE CUP HE HANDED HIM ALMOST AT A GULP.

‚ÄÚSOME MORE?‚ÄÙ ASKED KIRILLOV.

‚ÄÚNO, THANK YOU.‚ÄÙ

KIRILLOV, WHO HAD NOT SAT DOWN TILL THEN, SEATED HIMSELF FACING HIM, AND INQUIRED:

‚ÄÚWHY HAVE YOU COME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚON BUSINESS. HERE, READ THIS LETTER FROM GAGANOV; DO YOU REMEMBER, I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT HIM IN PETERSBURG.‚ÄÙ

KIRILLOV TOOK THE LETTER, READ IT, LAID IT ON THE TABLE AND LOOKED AT HIM EXPECTANTLY.

‚ÄÚAS YOU KNOW, I MET THIS GAGANOV FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE A MONTH AGO, IN PETERSBURG,‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH BEGAN TO EXPLAIN. ‚ÄÚWE CAME ACROSS EACH OTHER TWO OR THREE TIMES IN COMPANY WITH OTHER PEOPLE. WITHOUT MAKING MY ACQUAINTANCE AND WITHOUT ADDRESSING ME, HE MANAGED TO BE VERY INSOLENT TO ME. I TOLD YOU SO AT THE TIME; BUT NOW FOR SOMETHING YOU DON‚ÄÔT KNOW. AS HE WAS LEAVING PETERSBURG BEFORE I DID, HE SENT ME A LETTER, NOT LIKE THIS ONE, YET IMPERTINENT IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE, AND WHAT WAS QUEER ABOUT IT WAS THAT IT CONTAINED NO SORT OF EXPLANATION OF WHY IT WAS WRITTEN. I ANSWERED HIM AT ONCE, ALSO BY LETTER, AND SAID, QUITE FRANKLY, THAT HE WAS PROBABLY ANGRY WITH ME ON ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT WITH HIS FATHER FOUR YEARS AGO IN THE CLUB HERE, AND THAT I FOR MY PART WAS PREPARED TO MAKE HIM EVERY POSSIBLE APOLOGY, SEEING THAT MY ACTION WAS UNINTENTIONAL AND WAS THE RESULT OF ILLNESS. I BEGGED HIM TO CONSIDER AND ACCEPT MY APOLOGIES. HE WENT AWAY WITHOUT ANSWERING, AND NOW HERE I FIND HIM IN A REGULAR FURY. SEVERAL THINGS HE HAS SAID ABOUT ME IN PUBLIC HAVE BEEN REPEATED TO ME, ABSOLUTELY ABUSIVE, AND MAKING ASTOUNDING CHARGES AGAINST ME. FINALLY, TO-DAY, I GET THIS LETTER, A LETTER SUCH AS NO ONE HAS EVER HAD BEFORE, I SHOULD THINK, CONTAINING SUCH EXPRESSIONS AS ‚ÄÒTHE PUNCH YOU GOT IN YOUR UGLY FACE.‚ÄÔ I CAME IN THE HOPE THAT YOU WOULD NOT REFUSE TO BE MY SECOND.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU SAID NO ONE HAS EVER HAD SUCH A LETTER,‚ÄÙ OBSERVED KIRILLOV, ‚ÄÚTHEY MAY BE SENT IN A RAGE. SUCH LETTERS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN MORE THAN ONCE. PUSHKIN WROTE TO HEKERN. ALL RIGHT, I‚ÄÔLL COME. TELL ME HOW.‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH EXPLAINED THAT HE WANTED IT TO BE TO-MORROW, AND THAT HE MUST BEGIN BY RENEWING HIS OFFERS OF APOLOGY, AND EVEN WITH THE PROMISE OF ANOTHER LETTER OF APOLOGY, BUT ON CONDITION THAT GAGANOV, ON HIS SIDE, SHOULD PROMISE TO SEND NO MORE LETTERS. THE LETTER HE HAD RECEIVED HE WOULD REGARD AS UNWRITTEN.

‚ÄÚTOO MUCH CONCESSION; HE WON‚ÄÔT AGREE,‚ÄÙ SAID KIRILLOV.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE COME FIRST OF ALL TO FIND OUT WHETHER YOU WOULD CONSENT TO BE THE BEARER OF SUCH TERMS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL TAKE THEM. IT‚ÄÔS YOUR AFFAIR. BUT HE WON‚ÄÔT AGREE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNOW HE WON‚ÄÔT AGREE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE WANTS TO FIGHT. SAY HOW YOU‚ÄÔLL FIGHT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE POINT IS THAT I WANT THE THING SETTLED TO-MORROW. BY NINE O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE MORNING YOU MUST BE AT HIS HOUSE. HE‚ÄÔLL LISTEN, AND WON‚ÄÔT AGREE, BUT WILL PUT YOU IN COMMUNICATION WITH HIS SECOND‚ÄÎLET US SAY ABOUT ELEVEN. YOU WILL ARRANGE THINGS WITH HIM, AND LET US ALL BE ON THE SPOT BY ONE OR TWO O‚ÄÔCLOCK. PLEASE TRY TO ARRANGE THAT. THE WEAPONS, OF COURSE, WILL BE PISTOLS. AND I PARTICULARLY BEG YOU TO ARRANGE TO FIX THE BARRIERS AT TEN PACES APART; THEN YOU PUT EACH OF US TEN PACES FROM THE BARRIER, AND AT A GIVEN SIGNAL WE APPROACH. EACH MUST GO RIGHT UP TO HIS BARRIER, BUT YOU MAY FIRE BEFORE, ON THE WAY. I BELIEVE THAT‚ÄÔS ALL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTEN PACES BETWEEN THE BARRIERS IS VERY NEAR,‚ÄÙ OBSERVED KIRILLOV.

‚ÄÚWELL, TWELVE THEN, BUT NOT MORE. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT HE WANTS TO FIGHT IN EARNEST. DO YOU KNOW HOW TO LOAD A PISTOL?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DO. I‚ÄÔVE GOT PISTOLS. I‚ÄÔLL GIVE MY WORD THAT YOU‚ÄÔVE NEVER FIRED THEM. HIS SECOND WILL GIVE HIS WORD ABOUT HIS. THERE‚ÄÔLL BE TWO PAIRS OF PISTOLS, AND WE‚ÄÔLL TOSS UP, HIS OR OURS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEXCELLENT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWOULD YOU LIKE TO LOOK AT THE PISTOLS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚVERY WELL.‚ÄÙ

KIRILLOV SQUATTED ON HIS HEELS BEFORE THE TRUNK IN THE CORNER, WHICH HE HAD NEVER YET UNPACKED, THOUGH THINGS HAD BEEN PULLED OUT OF IT AS REQUIRED. HE PULLED OUT FROM THE BOTTOM A PALM-WOOD BOX LINED WITH RED VELVET, AND FROM IT TOOK OUT A PAIR OF SMART AND VERY EXPENSIVE PISTOLS.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE GOT EVERYTHING, POWDER, BULLETS, CARTRIDGES. I‚ÄÔVE A REVOLVER BESIDES, WAIT.‚ÄÙ

HE STOOPED DOWN TO THE TRUNK AGAIN AND TOOK OUT A SIX-CHAMBERED AMERICAN REVOLVER.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE GOT WEAPONS ENOUGH, AND VERY GOOD ONES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚVERY, EXTREMELY.‚ÄÙ

KIRILLOV, WHO WAS POOR, ALMOST DESTITUTE, THOUGH HE NEVER NOTICED HIS POVERTY, WAS EVIDENTLY PROUD OF SHOWING PRECIOUS WEAPONS, WHICH HE HAD CERTAINLY OBTAINED WITH GREAT SACRIFICE.

‚ÄÚYOU STILL HAVE THE SAME INTENTIONS?‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN ASKED AFTER A MOMENT‚ÄÔS SILENCE, AND WITH A CERTAIN WARINESS.

‚ÄÚYES,‚ÄÙ ANSWERED KIRILLOV SHORTLY, GUESSING AT ONCE FROM HIS VOICE WHAT HE WAS ASKING ABOUT, AND HE BEGAN TAKING THE WEAPONS FROM THE TABLE.

‚ÄÚWHEN?‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH INQUIRED STILL MORE CAUTIOUSLY, AFTER A PAUSE.

IN THE MEANTIME KIRILLOV HAD PUT BOTH THE BOXES BACK IN HIS TRUNK, AND SAT DOWN IN HIS PLACE AGAIN.

‚ÄÚTHAT DOESN‚ÄÔT DEPEND ON ME, AS YOU KNOW‚ÄÎWHEN THEY TELL ME,‚ÄÙ HE MUTTERED, AS THOUGH DISLIKING THE QUESTION; BUT AT THE SAME TIME WITH EVIDENT READINESS TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTION. HE KEPT HIS BLACK, LUSTRELESS EYES FIXED CONTINUALLY ON STAVROGIN WITH A CALM BUT WARM AND KINDLY EXPRESSION IN THEM.

‚ÄÚI UNDERSTAND SHOOTING ONESELF, OF COURSE,‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH BEGAN SUDDENLY, FROWNING A LITTLE, AFTER A DREAMY SILENCE THAT LASTED THREE MINUTES. ‚ÄÚI SOMETIMES HAVE THOUGHT OF IT MYSELF, AND THEN THERE ALWAYS CAME A NEW IDEA: IF ONE DID SOMETHING WICKED, OR, WORSE STILL, SOMETHING SHAMEFUL, THAT IS, DISGRACEFUL, ONLY VERY SHAMEFUL AND ‚Ä¶ RIDICULOUS, SUCH AS PEOPLE WOULD REMEMBER FOR A THOUSAND YEARS AND HOLD IN SCORN FOR A THOUSAND YEARS, AND SUDDENLY THE THOUGHT COMES: ‚ÄÒONE BLOW IN THE TEMPLE AND THERE WOULD BE NOTHING MORE.‚ÄÔ ONE WOULDN‚ÄÔT CARE THEN FOR MEN AND THAT THEY WOULD HOLD ONE IN SCORN FOR A THOUSAND YEARS, WOULD ONE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU CALL THAT A NEW IDEA?‚ÄÙ SAID KIRILLOV, AFTER A MOMENT‚ÄÔS THOUGHT.

‚ÄÚI ‚Ä¶ DIDN‚ÄÔT CALL IT SO, BUT WHEN I THOUGHT IT I FELT IT AS A NEW IDEA.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ‚ÄÒFELT THE IDEA‚ÄÔ?‚ÄÙ OBSERVED KIRILLOV. ‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS GOOD. THERE ARE LOTS OF IDEAS THAT ARE ALWAYS THERE AND YET SUDDENLY BECOME NEW. THAT‚ÄÔS TRUE. I SEE A GREAT DEAL NOW AS THOUGH IT WERE FOR THE FIRST TIME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSUPPOSE YOU HAD LIVED IN THE MOON,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN INTERRUPTED, NOT LISTENING, BUT PURSUING HIS OWN THOUGHT, ‚ÄÚAND SUPPOSE THERE YOU HAD DONE ALL THESE NASTY AND RIDICULOUS THINGS.‚Ä¶ YOU KNOW FROM HERE FOR CERTAIN THAT THEY WILL LAUGH AT YOU AND HOLD YOU IN SCORN FOR A THOUSAND YEARS AS LONG AS THE MOON LASTS. BUT NOW YOU ARE HERE, AND LOOKING AT THE MOON FROM HERE. YOU DON‚ÄÔT CARE HERE FOR ANYTHING YOU‚ÄÔVE DONE THERE, AND THAT THE PEOPLE THERE WILL HOLD YOU IN SCORN FOR A THOUSAND YEARS, DO YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT KNOW,‚ÄÙ ANSWERED KIRILLOV. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE NOT BEEN IN THE MOON,‚ÄÙ HE ADDED, WITHOUT ANY IRONY, SIMPLY TO STATE THE FACT.

‚ÄÚWHOSE BABY WAS THAT JUST NOW?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE OLD WOMAN‚ÄÔS MOTHER-IN-LAW WAS HERE‚ÄÎNO, DAUGHTER-IN-LAW, IT‚ÄÔS ALL THE SAME. THREE DAYS. SHE‚ÄÔS LYING ILL WITH THE BABY, IT CRIES A LOT AT NIGHT, IT‚ÄÔS THE STOMACH. THE MOTHER SLEEPS, BUT THE OLD WOMAN PICKS IT UP; I PLAY BALL WITH IT. THE BALL‚ÄÔS FROM HAMBURG. I BOUGHT IT IN HAMBURG TO THROW IT AND CATCH IT, IT STRENGTHENS THE SPINE. IT‚ÄÔS A GIRL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚARE YOU FOND OF CHILDREN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM,‚ÄÙ ANSWERED KIRILLOV, THOUGH RATHER INDIFFERENTLY.

‚ÄÚTHEN YOU‚ÄÔRE FOND OF LIFE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, I‚ÄÔM FOND OF LIFE! WHAT OF IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHOUGH YOU‚ÄÔVE MADE UP YOUR MIND TO SHOOT YOURSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT OF IT? WHY CONNECT IT? LIFE‚ÄÔS ONE THING AND THAT‚ÄÔS ANOTHER. LIFE EXISTS, BUT DEATH DOESN‚ÄÔT AT ALL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE BEGUN TO BELIEVE IN A FUTURE ETERNAL LIFE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, NOT IN A FUTURE ETERNAL LIFE, BUT IN ETERNAL LIFE HERE. THERE ARE MOMENTS, YOU REACH MOMENTS, AND TIME SUDDENLY STANDS STILL, AND IT WILL BECOME ETERNAL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU HOPE TO REACH SUCH A MOMENT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔLL SCARCELY BE POSSIBLE IN OUR TIME,‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH RESPONDED SLOWLY AND, AS IT WERE, DREAMILY; THE TWO SPOKE WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST IRONY. ‚ÄÚIN THE APOCALYPSE THE ANGEL SWEARS THAT THERE WILL BE NO MORE TIME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNOW. THAT‚ÄÔS VERY TRUE; DISTINCT AND EXACT. WHEN ALL MANKIND ATTAINS HAPPINESS THEN THERE WILL BE NO MORE TIME, FOR THERE‚ÄÔLL BE NO NEED OF IT, A VERY TRUE THOUGHT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHERE WILL THEY PUT IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOWHERE. TIME‚ÄÔS NOT AN OBJECT BUT AN IDEA. IT WILL BE EXTINGUISHED IN THE MIND.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE OLD COMMONPLACES OF PHILOSOPHY, THE SAME FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN MUTTERED WITH A KIND OF DISDAINFUL COMPASSION.

‚ÄÚALWAYS THE SAME, ALWAYS THE SAME, FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME AND NEVER ANY OTHER,‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV SAID WITH SPARKLING EYES, AS THOUGH THERE WERE ALMOST A TRIUMPH IN THAT IDEA.

‚ÄÚYOU SEEM TO BE VERY HAPPY, KIRILLOV.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, VERY HAPPY,‚ÄÙ HE ANSWERED, AS THOUGH MAKING THE MOST ORDINARY REPLY.

‚ÄÚBUT YOU WERE DISTRESSED SO LATELY, ANGRY WITH LIPUTIN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚH‚ÄÔM ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔM NOT SCOLDING NOW. I DIDN‚ÄÔT KNOW THEN THAT I WAS HAPPY. HAVE YOU SEEN A LEAF, A LEAF FROM A TREE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SAW A YELLOW ONE LATELY, A LITTLE GREEN. IT WAS DECAYED AT THE EDGES. IT WAS BLOWN BY THE WIND. WHEN I WAS TEN YEARS OLD I USED TO SHUT MY EYES IN THE WINTER ON PURPOSE AND FANCY A GREEN LEAF, BRIGHT, WITH VEINS ON IT, AND THE SUN SHINING. I USED TO OPEN MY EYES AND NOT BELIEVE THEM, BECAUSE IT WAS VERY NICE, AND I USED TO SHUT THEM AGAIN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THAT? AN ALLEGORY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚN-NO ‚Ä¶ WHY? I‚ÄÔM NOT SPEAKING OF AN ALLEGORY, BUT OF A LEAF, ONLY A LEAF. THE LEAF IS GOOD. EVERYTHING‚ÄÔS GOOD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEVERYTHING?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEVERYTHING. MAN IS UNHAPPY BECAUSE HE DOESN‚ÄÔT KNOW HE‚ÄÔS HAPPY. IT‚ÄÔS ONLY THAT. THAT‚ÄÔS ALL, THAT‚ÄÔS ALL! IF ANYONE FINDS OUT HE‚ÄÔLL BECOME HAPPY AT ONCE, THAT MINUTE. THAT MOTHER-IN-LAW WILL DIE; BUT THE BABY WILL REMAIN. IT‚ÄÔS ALL GOOD. I DISCOVERED IT ALL OF A SUDDEN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND IF ANYONE DIES OF HUNGER, AND IF ANYONE INSULTS AND OUTRAGES THE LITTLE GIRL, IS THAT GOOD?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES! AND IF ANYONE BLOWS HIS BRAINS OUT FOR THE BABY, THAT‚ÄÔS GOOD TOO. AND IF ANYONE DOESN‚ÄÔT, THAT‚ÄÔS GOOD TOO. IT‚ÄÔS ALL GOOD, ALL. IT‚ÄÔS GOOD FOR ALL THOSE WHO KNOW THAT IT‚ÄÔS ALL GOOD. IF THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS GOOD FOR THEM, IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THEM, BUT AS LONG AS THEY DON‚ÄÔT KNOW IT‚ÄÔS GOOD FOR THEM, IT WILL BE BAD FOR THEM. THAT‚ÄÔS THE WHOLE IDEA, THE WHOLE OF IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHEN DID YOU FIND OUT YOU WERE SO HAPPY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLAST WEEK, ON TUESDAY, NO, WEDNESDAY, FOR IT WAS WEDNESDAY BY THAT TIME, IN THE NIGHT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBY WHAT REASONING?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT REMEMBER; I WAS WALKING ABOUT THE ROOM; NEVER MIND. I STOPPED MY CLOCK. IT WAS THIRTY-SEVEN MINUTES PAST TWO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAS AN EMBLEM OF THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE NO MORE TIME?‚ÄÙ

KIRILLOV WAS SILENT.

‚ÄÚTHEY‚ÄÔRE BAD BECAUSE THEY DON‚ÄÔT KNOW THEY‚ÄÔRE GOOD. WHEN THEY FIND OUT, THEY WON‚ÄÔT OUTRAGE A LITTLE GIRL. THEY‚ÄÔLL FIND OUT THAT THEY‚ÄÔRE GOOD AND THEY‚ÄÔLL ALL BECOME GOOD, EVERY ONE OF THEM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHERE YOU‚ÄÔVE FOUND IT OUT, SO HAVE YOU BECOME GOOD THEN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM GOOD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT I AGREE WITH, THOUGH,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN MUTTERED, FROWNING.

‚ÄÚHE WHO TEACHES THAT ALL ARE GOOD WILL END THE WORLD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE WHO TAUGHT IT WAS CRUCIFIED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE WILL COME, AND HIS NAME WILL BE THE MAN-GOD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE GOD-MAN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE MAN-GOD. THAT‚ÄÔS THE DIFFERENCE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSURELY IT WASN‚ÄÔT YOU LIGHTED THE LAMP UNDER THE IKON?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, IT WAS I LIGHTED IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDID YOU DO IT BELIEVING?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE OLD WOMAN LIKES TO HAVE THE LAMP AND SHE HADN‚ÄÔT TIME TO DO IT TO-DAY,‚ÄÙ MUTTERED KIRILLOV.

‚ÄÚYOU DON‚ÄÔT SAY PRAYERS YOURSELF?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI PRAY TO EVERYTHING. YOU SEE THE SPIDER CRAWLING ON THE WALL, I LOOK AT IT AND THANK IT FOR CRAWLING.‚ÄÙ

HIS EYES GLOWED AGAIN. HE KEPT LOOKING STRAIGHT AT STAVROGIN WITH FIRM AND UNFLINCHING EXPRESSION. STAVROGIN FROWNED AND WATCHED HIM DISDAINFULLY, BUT THERE WAS NO MOCKERY IN HIS EYES.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL BET THAT WHEN I COME NEXT TIME YOU‚ÄÔLL BE BELIEVING IN GOD TOO,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, GETTING UP AND TAKING HIS HAT.

‚ÄÚWHY?‚ÄÙ SAID KIRILLOV, GETTING UP TOO.

‚ÄÚIF YOU WERE TO FIND OUT THAT YOU BELIEVE IN GOD, THEN YOU‚ÄÔD BELIEVE IN HIM; BUT SINCE YOU DON‚ÄÔT KNOW THAT YOU BELIEVE IN HIM, THEN YOU DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE IN HIM,‚ÄÙ LAUGHED NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS NOT RIGHT,‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV PONDERED, ‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE DISTORTED THE IDEA. IT‚ÄÔS A FLIPPANT JOKE. REMEMBER WHAT YOU HAVE MEANT IN MY LIFE, STAVROGIN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGOOD-BYE, KIRILLOV.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCOME AT NIGHT; WHEN WILL YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, HAVEN‚ÄÔT YOU FORGOTTEN ABOUT TO-MORROW?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚACH, I‚ÄÔD FORGOTTEN. DON‚ÄÔT BE UNEASY. I WON‚ÄÔT OVERSLEEP. AT NINE O‚ÄÔCLOCK. I KNOW HOW TO WAKE UP WHEN I WANT TO. I GO TO BED SAYING ‚ÄÒSEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK,‚ÄÔ AND I WAKE UP AT SEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK, ‚ÄÒTEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK,‚ÄÔ AND I WAKE UP AT TEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU HAVE REMARKABLE POWERS,‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, LOOKING AT HIS PALE FACE.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL COME AND OPEN THE GATE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT TROUBLE, SHATOV WILL OPEN IT FOR ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAH, SHATOV. VERY WELL, GOOD-BYE.‚ÄÙ

VI

THE DOOR OF THE EMPTY HOUSE IN WHICH SHATOV WAS LODGING WAS NOT CLOSED; BUT, MAKING HIS WAY INTO THE PASSAGE, STAVROGIN FOUND HIMSELF IN UTTER DARKNESS, AND BEGAN FEELING WITH HIS HAND FOR THE STAIRS TO THE UPPER STORY. SUDDENLY A DOOR OPENED UPSTAIRS AND A LIGHT APPEARED. SHATOV DID NOT COME OUT HIMSELF, BUT SIMPLY OPENED HIS DOOR. WHEN NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF THE ROOM, HE SAW SHATOV STANDING AT THE TABLE IN THE CORNER, WAITING EXPECTANTLY.

‚ÄÚWILL YOU RECEIVE ME ON BUSINESS?‚ÄÙ HE QUERIED FROM THE DOORWAY.

‚ÄÚCOME IN AND SIT DOWN,‚ÄÙ ANSWERED SHATOV. ‚ÄÚSHUT THE DOOR; STAY, I‚ÄÔLL SHUT IT.‚ÄÙ

HE LOCKED THE DOOR, RETURNED TO THE TABLE, AND SAT DOWN, FACING NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH. HE HAD GROWN THINNER DURING THAT WEEK, AND NOW HE SEEMED IN A FEVER.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN WORRYING ME TO DEATH,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, LOOKING DOWN, IN A SOFT HALF-WHISPER. ‚ÄÚWHY DIDN‚ÄÔT YOU COME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU WERE SO SURE I SHOULD COME THEN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, STAY, I HAVE BEEN DELIRIOUS ‚Ä¶ PERHAPS I‚ÄÔM DELIRIOUS NOW.‚Ä¶ STAY A MOMENT.‚ÄÙ

HE GOT UP AND SEIZED SOMETHING THAT WAS LYING ON THE UPPERMOST OF HIS THREE BOOKSHELVES. IT WAS A REVOLVER.

‚ÄÚONE NIGHT, IN DELIRIUM, I FANCIED THAT YOU WERE COMING TO KILL ME, AND EARLY NEXT MORNING I SPENT MY LAST FARTHING ON BUYING A REVOLVER FROM THAT GOOD-FOR-NOTHING FELLOW LYAMSHIN; I DID NOT MEAN TO LET YOU DO IT. THEN I CAME TO MYSELF AGAIN ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔVE NEITHER POWDER NOR SHOT; IT HAS BEEN LYING THERE ON THE SHELF TILL NOW; WAIT A MINUTE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

HE GOT UP AND WAS OPENING THE CASEMENT.

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT THROW IT AWAY, WHY SHOULD YOU?‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH CHECKED HIM. ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS WORTH SOMETHING. BESIDES, TOMORROW PEOPLE WILL BEGIN SAYING THAT THERE ARE REVOLVERS LYING ABOUT UNDER SHATOV‚ÄÔS WINDOW. PUT IT BACK, THAT‚ÄÔS RIGHT; SIT DOWN. TELL ME, WHY DO YOU SEEM TO BE PENITENT FOR HAVING THOUGHT I SHOULD COME TO KILL YOU? I HAVE NOT COME NOW TO BE RECONCILED, BUT TO TALK OF SOMETHING NECESSARY. ENLIGHTEN ME TO BEGIN WITH. YOU DIDN‚ÄÔT GIVE ME THAT BLOW BECAUSE OF MY CONNECTION WITH YOUR WIFE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU KNOW I DIDN‚ÄÔT, YOURSELF,‚ÄÙ SAID SHATOV, LOOKING DOWN AGAIN.

‚ÄÚAND NOT BECAUSE YOU BELIEVED THE STUPID GOSSIP ABOUT DARYA PAVLOVNA?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, NO, OF COURSE NOT! IT‚ÄÔS NONSENSE! MY SISTER TOLD ME FROM THE VERY FIRST ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ SHATOV SAID, HARSHLY AND IMPATIENTLY, AND EVEN WITH A SLIGHT STAMP OF HIS FOOT.

‚ÄÚTHEN I GUESSED RIGHT AND YOU TOO GUESSED RIGHT,‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WENT ON IN A TRANQUIL VOICE. ‚ÄÚYOU ARE RIGHT. MARYA TIMOFYEVNA LEBYADKIN IS MY LAWFUL WIFE, MARRIED TO ME FOUR AND A HALF YEARS AGO IN PETERSBURG. I SUPPOSE THE BLOW WAS ON HER ACCOUNT?‚ÄÙ

SHATOV, UTTERLY ASTOUNDED, LISTENED IN SILENCE.

‚ÄÚI GUESSED, BUT DID NOT BELIEVE IT,‚ÄÙ HE MUTTERED AT LAST, LOOKING STRANGELY AT STAVROGIN.

‚ÄÚAND YOU STRUCK ME?‚ÄÙ

SHATOV FLUSHED AND MUTTERED ALMOST INCOHERENTLY:

‚ÄÚBECAUSE OF YOUR FALL ‚Ä¶ YOUR LIE. I DIDN‚ÄÔT GO UP TO YOU TO PUNISH YOU ‚Ä¶ I DIDN‚ÄÔT KNOW WHEN I WENT UP TO YOU THAT I SHOULD STRIKE YOU ‚Ä¶ I DID IT BECAUSE YOU MEANT SO MUCH TO ME IN MY LIFE ‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI UNDERSTAND, I UNDERSTAND, SPARE YOUR WORDS. I AM SORRY YOU ARE FEVERISH. I‚ÄÔVE COME ABOUT A MOST URGENT MATTER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI HAVE BEEN EXPECTING YOU TOO LONG.‚ÄÙ SHATOV SEEMED TO BE QUIVERING ALL OVER, AND HE GOT UP FROM HIS SEAT. ‚ÄÚSAY WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔLL SPEAK TOO ‚Ä¶ LATER.‚ÄÙ

HE SAT DOWN.

‚ÄÚWHAT I HAVE COME ABOUT IS NOTHING OF THAT KIND,‚ÄÙ BEGAN NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, SCRUTINISING HIM WITH CURIOSITY. ‚ÄÚOWING TO CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES I WAS FORCED THIS VERY DAY TO CHOOSE SUCH AN HOUR TO COME AND TELL YOU THAT THEY MAY MURDER YOU.‚ÄÙ

SHATOV LOOKED WILDLY AT HIM.

‚ÄÚI KNOW THAT I MAY BE IN SOME DANGER,‚ÄÙ HE SAID IN MEASURED TONES, ‚ÄÚBUT HOW CAN YOU HAVE COME TO KNOW OF IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBECAUSE I BELONG TO THEM AS YOU DO, AND AM A MEMBER OF THEIR SOCIETY, JUST AS YOU ARE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ‚Ä¶ YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SEE FROM YOUR EYES THAT YOU WERE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING FROM ME RATHER THAN THAT,‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, WITH A FAINT SMILE. ‚ÄÚBUT, EXCUSE ME, YOU KNEW THEN THAT THERE WOULD BE AN ATTEMPT ON YOUR LIFE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOTHING OF THE SORT. AND I DON‚ÄÔT THINK SO NOW, IN SPITE OF YOUR WORDS, THOUGH ‚Ä¶ THOUGH THERE‚ÄÔS NO BEING SURE OF ANYTHING WITH THESE FOOLS!‚ÄÙ HE CRIED SUDDENLY IN A FURY, STRIKING THE TABLE WITH HIS FIST. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM NOT AFRAID OF THEM! I‚ÄÔVE BROKEN WITH THEM. THAT FELLOW‚ÄÔS RUN HERE FOUR TIMES TO TELL ME IT WAS POSSIBLE ‚Ä¶ BUT‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHE LOOKED AT STAVROGIN‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT, EXACTLY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT BE UNEASY; I AM NOT DECEIVING YOU,‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WENT ON, RATHER COLDLY, WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO IS ONLY FULFILLING A DUTY. ‚ÄÚYOU QUESTION ME AS TO WHAT I KNOW. I KNOW THAT YOU ENTERED THAT SOCIETY ABROAD, TWO YEARS AGO, AT THE TIME OF THE OLD ORGANISATION, JUST BEFORE YOU WENT TO AMERICA, AND I BELIEVE, JUST AFTER OUR LAST CONVERSATION, ABOUT WHICH YOU WROTE SO MUCH TO ME IN YOUR LETTER FROM AMERICA. BY THE WAY, I MUST APOLOGISE FOR NOT HAVING ANSWERED YOU BY LETTER, BUT CONFINED MYSELF TO ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO SENDING THE MONEY; WAIT A BIT,‚ÄÙ SHATOV INTERRUPTED, HURRIEDLY PULLING OUT A DRAWER IN THE TABLE AND TAKING FROM UNDER SOME PAPERS A RAINBOW-COLOURED NOTE. ‚ÄÚHERE, TAKE IT, THE HUNDRED ROUBLES YOU SENT ME; BUT FOR YOU I SHOULD HAVE PERISHED OUT THERE. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME PAYING IT BACK IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR YOUR MOTHER. SHE MADE ME A PRESENT OF THAT NOTE NINE MONTHS AGO, BECAUSE I WAS SO BADLY OFF AFTER MY ILLNESS. BUT, GO ON, PLEASE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

HE WAS BREATHLESS.

‚ÄÚIN AMERICA YOU CHANGED YOUR VIEWS, AND WHEN YOU CAME BACK YOU WANTED TO RESIGN. THEY GAVE YOU NO ANSWER, BUT CHARGED YOU TO TAKE OVER A PRINTING PRESS HERE IN RUSSIA FROM SOMEONE, AND TO KEEP IT TILL YOU HANDED IT OVER TO SOMEONE WHO WOULD COME FROM THEM FOR IT. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW THE DETAILS EXACTLY, BUT I FANCY THAT‚ÄÔS THE POSITION IN OUTLINE. YOU UNDERTOOK IT IN THE HOPE, OR ON THE CONDITION, THAT IT WOULD BE THE LAST TASK THEY WOULD REQUIRE OF YOU, AND THAT THEN THEY WOULD RELEASE YOU ALTOGETHER. WHETHER THAT IS SO OR NOT, I LEARNT IT, NOT FROM THEM, BUT QUITE BY CHANCE. BUT NOW FOR WHAT I FANCY YOU DON‚ÄÔT KNOW; THESE GENTRY HAVE NO INTENTION OF PARTING WITH YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS ABSURD!‚ÄÙ CRIED SHATOV. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE TOLD THEM HONESTLY THAT I‚ÄÔVE CUT MYSELF OFF FROM THEM IN EVERYTHING. THAT IS MY RIGHT, THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE AND OF THOUGHT.‚Ä¶ I WON‚ÄÔT PUT UP WITH IT! THERE‚ÄÔS NO POWER WHICH COULD ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SAY, DON‚ÄÔT SHOUT,‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SAID EARNESTLY, CHECKING HIM. ‚ÄÚTHAT VERHOVENSKY IS SUCH A FELLOW THAT HE MAY BE LISTENING TO US NOW IN YOUR PASSAGE, PERHAPS, WITH HIS OWN EARS OR SOMEONE ELSE‚ÄÔS. EVEN THAT DRUNKARD, LEBYADKIN, WAS PROBABLY BOUND TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOU, AND YOU ON HIM, TOO, I DARE SAY? YOU‚ÄÔD BETTER TELL ME, HAS VERHOVENSKY ACCEPTED YOUR ARGUMENTS NOW, OR NOT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE HAS. HE HAS SAID THAT IT CAN BE DONE AND THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL THEN, HE‚ÄÔS DECEIVING YOU. I KNOW THAT EVEN KIRILLOV, WHO SCARCELY BELONGS TO THEM AT ALL, HAS GIVEN THEM INFORMATION ABOUT YOU. AND THEY HAVE LOTS OF AGENTS, EVEN PEOPLE WHO DON‚ÄÔT KNOW THAT THEY‚ÄÔRE SERVING THE SOCIETY. THEY‚ÄÔVE ALWAYS KEPT A WATCH ON YOU. ONE OF THE THINGS PYOTR VERHOVENSKY CAME HERE FOR WAS TO SETTLE YOUR BUSINESS ONCE FOR ALL, AND HE IS FULLY AUTHORISED TO DO SO, THAT IS AT THE FIRST GOOD OPPORTUNITY, TO GET RID OF YOU, AS A MAN WHO KNOWS TOO MUCH AND MIGHT GIVE THEM AWAY. I REPEAT THAT THIS IS CERTAIN, AND ALLOW ME TO ADD THAT THEY ARE, FOR SOME REASON, CONVINCED THAT YOU ARE A SPY, AND THAT IF YOU HAVEN‚ÄÔT INFORMED AGAINST THEM YET, YOU WILL. IS THAT TRUE?‚ÄÙ

SHATOV MADE A WRY FACE AT HEARING SUCH A QUESTION ASKED IN SUCH A MATTER-OF FACT TONE.

‚ÄÚIF I WERE A SPY, WHOM COULD I INFORM?‚ÄÙ HE SAID ANGRILY, NOT GIVING A DIRECT ANSWER. ‚ÄÚNO, LEAVE ME ALONE, LET ME GO TO THE DEVIL!‚ÄÙ HE CRIED SUDDENLY, CATCHING AGAIN AT HIS ORIGINAL IDEA, WHICH AGITATED HIM VIOLENTLY. APPARENTLY IT AFFECTED HIM MORE DEEPLY THAN THE NEWS OF HIS OWN DANGER. ‚ÄÚYOU, YOU, STAVROGIN, HOW COULD YOU MIX YOURSELF UP WITH SUCH SHAMEFUL, STUPID, SECOND-HAND ABSURDITY? YOU A MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY? WHAT AN EXPLOIT FOR STAVROGIN!‚ÄÙ HE CRIED SUDDENLY, IN DESPAIR.

HE CLASPED HIS HANDS, AS THOUGH NOTHING COULD BE A BITTERER AND MORE INCONSOLABLE GRIEF TO HIM THAN SUCH A DISCOVERY.

‚ÄÚEXCUSE ME,‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, EXTREMELY SURPRISED, ‚ÄÚBUT YOU SEEM TO LOOK UPON ME AS A SORT OF SUN, AND ON YOURSELF AS AN INSECT IN COMPARISON. I NOTICED THAT EVEN FROM YOUR LETTER IN AMERICA.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ‚Ä¶ YOU KNOW.‚Ä¶ OH, LET US DROP ME ALTOGETHER,‚ÄÙ SHATOV BROKE OFF SUDDENLY, ‚ÄÚAND IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN ANYTHING ABOUT YOURSELF EXPLAIN IT.‚Ä¶ ANSWER MY QUESTION!‚ÄÙ HE REPEATED FEVERISHLY.

‚ÄÚWITH PLEASURE. YOU ASK HOW I COULD GET INTO SUCH A DEN? AFTER WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU, I‚ÄÔM BOUND TO BE FRANK WITH YOU TO SOME EXTENT ON THE SUBJECT. YOU SEE, STRICTLY SPEAKING, I DON‚ÄÔT BELONG TO THE SOCIETY AT ALL, AND I NEVER HAVE BELONGED TO IT, AND I‚ÄÔVE MUCH MORE RIGHT THAN YOU TO LEAVE THEM, BECAUSE I NEVER JOINED THEM. IN FACT, FROM THE VERY BEGINNING I TOLD THEM THAT I WAS NOT ONE OF THEM, AND THAT IF I‚ÄÔVE HAPPENED TO HELP THEM IT HAS SIMPLY BEEN BY ACCIDENT AS A MAN OF LEISURE. I TOOK SOME PART IN REORGANISING THE SOCIETY, ON THE NEW PLAN, BUT THAT WAS ALL. BUT NOW THEY‚ÄÔVE CHANGED THEIR VIEWS, AND HAVE MADE UP THEIR MINDS THAT IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO LET ME GO, AND I BELIEVE I‚ÄÔM SENTENCED TO DEATH TOO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, THEY DO NOTHING BUT SENTENCE TO DEATH, AND ALL BY MEANS OF SEALED DOCUMENTS, SIGNED BY THREE MEN AND A HALF. AND YOU THINK THEY‚ÄÔVE ANY POWER!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE PARTLY RIGHT THERE AND PARTLY NOT,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN ANSWERED WITH THE SAME INDIFFERENCE, ALMOST LISTLESSNESS. ‚ÄÚTHERE‚ÄÔS NO DOUBT THAT THERE‚ÄÔS A GREAT DEAL THAT‚ÄÔS FANCIFUL ABOUT IT, AS THERE ALWAYS IS IN SUCH CASES: A HANDFUL MAGNIFIES ITS SIZE AND SIGNIFICANCE. TO MY THINKING, IF YOU WILL HAVE IT, THE ONLY ONE IS PYOTR VERHOVENSKY, AND IT‚ÄÔS SIMPLY GOOD-NATURE ON HIS PART TO CONSIDER HIMSELF ONLY AN AGENT OF THE SOCIETY. BUT THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEA IS NO STUPIDER THAN OTHERS OF THE SORT. THEY ARE CONNECTED WITH THE INTERNATIONALE. THEY HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING AGENTS IN RUSSIA, THEY HAVE EVEN HIT ON A RATHER ORIGINAL METHOD, THOUGH IT‚ÄÔS ONLY THEORETICAL, OF COURSE. AS FOR THEIR INTENTIONS HERE, THE MOVEMENTS OF OUR RUSSIAN ORGANISATION ARE SOMETHING SO OBSCURE AND ALMOST ALWAYS UNEXPECTED THAT REALLY THEY MIGHT TRY ANYTHING AMONG US. NOTE THAT VERHOVENSKY IS AN OBSTINATE MAN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS A BUG, AN IGNORAMUS, A BUFFOON, WHO UNDERSTANDS NOTHING IN RUSSIA!‚ÄÙ CRIED SHATOV SPITEFULLY.

‚ÄÚYOU KNOW HIM VERY LITTLE. IT‚ÄÔS QUITE TRUE THAT NONE OF THEM UNDERSTAND MUCH ABOUT RUSSIA, BUT NOT MUCH LESS THAN YOU AND I DO. BESIDES, VERHOVENSKY IS AN ENTHUSIAST.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚVERHOVENSKY AN ENTHUSIAST?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, YES. THERE IS A POINT WHEN HE CEASES TO BE A BUFFOON AND BECOMES A MADMAN. I BEG YOU TO REMEMBER YOUR OWN EXPRESSION: ‚ÄÒDO YOU KNOW HOW POWERFUL A SINGLE MAN MAY BE?‚ÄÔ PLEASE DON‚ÄÔT LAUGH ABOUT IT, HE‚ÄÔS QUITE CAPABLE OF PULLING A TRIGGER. THEY ARE CONVINCED THAT I AM A SPY TOO. AS THEY DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HOW TO DO THINGS THEMSELVES, THEY‚ÄÔRE AWFULLY FOND OF ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SPIES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT AFRAID, ARE YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚN‚ÄÎNO. I‚ÄÔM NOT VERY MUCH AFRAID.‚Ä¶ BUT YOUR CASE IS QUITE DIFFERENT. I WARNED YOU THAT YOU MIGHT ANYWAY KEEP IT IN MIND. TO MY THINKING THERE‚ÄÔS NO REASON TO BE OFFENDED IN BEING THREATENED WITH DANGER BY FOOLS; THEIR BRAINS DON‚ÄÔT AFFECT THE QUESTION. THEY‚ÄÔVE RAISED THEIR HAND AGAINST BETTER MEN THAN YOU OR ME. IT‚ÄÔS A QUARTER PAST ELEVEN, THOUGH.‚ÄÙ HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND GOT UP FROM HIS CHAIR. ‚ÄÚI WANTED TO ASK YOU ONE QUITE IRRELEVANT QUESTION.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFOR GOD‚ÄÔS SAKE!‚ÄÙ CRIED SHATOV, RISING IMPULSIVELY FROM HIS SEAT.

‚ÄÚI BEG YOUR PARDON?‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH LOOKED AT HIM INQUIRINGLY.

‚ÄÚASK IT, ASK YOUR QUESTION FOR GOD‚ÄÔS SAKE,‚ÄÙ SHATOV REPEATED IN INDESCRIBABLE EXCITEMENT, ‚ÄÚBUT ON CONDITION THAT I ASK YOU A QUESTION TOO. I BESEECH YOU TO ALLOW ME ‚Ä¶ I CAN‚ÄÔT ‚Ä¶ ASK YOUR QUESTION!‚ÄÙ

STAVROGIN WAITED A MOMENT AND THEN BEGAN. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE HEARD THAT YOU HAVE SOME INFLUENCE ON MARYA TIMOFYEVNA, AND THAT SHE WAS FOND OF SEEING YOU AND HEARING YOU TALK. IS THAT SO?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES ‚Ä¶ SHE USED TO LISTEN ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ SAID SHATOV, CONFUSED.

‚ÄÚWITHIN A DAY OR TWO I INTEND TO MAKE A PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF OUR MARRIAGE HERE IN THE TOWN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIS THAT POSSIBLE?‚ÄÙ SHATOV WHISPERED, ALMOST WITH HORROR.

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT QUITE UNDERSTAND YOU. THERE‚ÄÔS NO SORT OF DIFFICULTY ABOUT IT, WITNESSES TO THE MARRIAGE ARE HERE. EVERYTHING TOOK PLACE IN PETERSBURG, PERFECTLY LEGALLY AND SMOOTHLY, AND IF IT HAS NOT BEEN MADE KNOWN TILL NOW, IT IS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE WITNESSES, KIRILLOV, PYOTR VERHOVENSKY, AND LEBYADKIN (WHOM I NOW HAVE THE PLEASURE OF CLAIMING AS A BROTHER-IN-LAW) PROMISED TO HOLD THEIR TONGUES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT MEAN THAT ‚Ä¶ YOU SPEAK SO CALMLY ‚Ä¶ BUT GOOD! LISTEN! YOU WEREN‚ÄÔT FORCED INTO THAT MARRIAGE, WERE YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, NO ONE FORCED ME INTO IT.‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SMILED AT SHATOV‚ÄÔS IMPORTUNATE HASTE.

‚ÄÚAND WHAT‚ÄÔS THAT TALK SHE KEEPS UP ABOUT HER BABY?‚ÄÙ SHATOV INTERPOSED DISCONNECTEDLY, WITH FEVERISH HASTE.

‚ÄÚSHE TALKS ABOUT HER BABY? BAH! I DIDN‚ÄÔT KNOW. IT‚ÄÔS THE FIRST TIME I‚ÄÔVE HEARD OF IT. SHE NEVER HAD A BABY AND COULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE HAD: MARYA TIMOFYEVNA IS A VIRGIN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAH! THAT‚ÄÔS JUST WHAT I THOUGHT! LISTEN!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THE MATTER WITH YOU, SHATOV?‚ÄÙ

SHATOV HID HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS, TURNED AWAY, BUT SUDDENLY CLUTCHED STAVROGIN BY THE SHOULDERS.

‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW WHY, DO YOU KNOW WHY, ANYWAY,‚ÄÙ HE SHOUTED, ‚ÄÚWHY YOU DID ALL THIS, AND WHY YOU ARE RESOLVED ON SUCH A PUNISHMENT NOW!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOUR QUESTION IS CLEVER AND MALIGNANT, BUT I MEAN TO SURPRISE YOU TOO; I FANCY I DO KNOW WHY I GOT MARRIED THEN, AND WHY I AM RESOLVED ON SUCH A PUNISHMENT NOW, AS YOU EXPRESS IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLET‚ÄÔS LEAVE THAT ‚Ä¶ OF THAT LATER. PUT IT OFF. LET‚ÄÔS TALK OF THE CHIEF THING, THE CHIEF THING. I‚ÄÔVE BEEN WAITING TWO YEARS FOR YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE WAITED TOO LONG FOR YOU. I‚ÄÔVE BEEN THINKING OF YOU INCESSANTLY. YOU ARE THE ONLY MAN WHO COULD MOVE ‚Ä¶ I WROTE TO YOU ABOUT IT FROM AMERICA.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI REMEMBER YOUR LONG LETTER VERY WELL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTOO LONG TO BE READ? NO DOUBT; SIX SHEETS OF NOTEPAPER. DON‚ÄÔT SPEAK! DON‚ÄÔT SPEAK! TELL ME, CAN YOU SPARE ME ANOTHER TEN MINUTES?‚Ä¶ BUT NOW, THIS MINUTE ‚Ä¶ I HAVE WAITED FOR YOU TOO LONG.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCERTAINLY, HALF AN HOUR IF YOU LIKE, BUT NOT MORE, IF THAT WILL SUIT YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND ON CONDITION, TOO,‚ÄÙ SHATOV PUT IN WRATHFULLY, ‚ÄÚTHAT YOU TAKE A DIFFERENT TONE. DO YOU HEAR? I DEMAND WHEN I OUGHT TO ENTREAT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO DEMAND WHEN ONE OUGHT TO ENTREAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI UNDERSTAND THAT IN THAT WAY YOU LIFT YOURSELF ABOVE ALL ORDINARY CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE SAKE OF LOFTIER AIMS,‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WITH A FAINT SMILE. ‚ÄÚI SEE WITH REGRET, TOO, THAT YOU‚ÄÔRE FEVERISH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI BEG YOU TO TREAT ME WITH RESPECT, I INSIST ON IT!‚ÄÙ SHOUTED SHATOV, ‚ÄÚNOT MY PERSONALITY‚ÄÎI DON‚ÄÔT CARE A HANG FOR THAT, BUT SOMETHING ELSE, JUST FOR THIS ONCE. WHILE I AM TALKING ‚Ä¶ WE ARE TWO BEINGS, AND HAVE COME TOGETHER IN INFINITY ‚Ä¶ FOR THE LAST TIME IN THE WORLD. DROP YOUR TONE, AND SPEAK LIKE A HUMAN BEING! SPEAK, IF ONLY FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE WITH THE VOICE OF A MAN. I SAY IT NOT FOR MY SAKE BUT FOR YOURS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU OUGHT TO FORGIVE ME THAT BLOW IN THE FACE IF ONLY BECAUSE I GAVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY OF REALISING YOUR IMMENSE POWER.‚Ä¶ AGAIN YOU SMILE YOUR DISDAINFUL, WORLDLY SMILE! OH, WHEN WILL YOU UNDERSTAND ME! HAVE DONE WITH BEING A SNOB! UNDERSTAND THAT I INSIST ON THAT. I INSIST ON IT, ELSE I WON‚ÄÔT SPEAK, I‚ÄÔM NOT GOING TO FOR ANYTHING!‚ÄÙ

HIS EXCITEMENT WAS APPROACHING FRENZY. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH FROWNED AND SEEMED TO BECOME MORE ON HIS GUARD.

‚ÄÚSINCE I HAVE REMAINED ANOTHER HALF-HOUR WITH YOU WHEN TIME IS SO PRECIOUS,‚ÄÙ HE PRONOUNCED EARNESTLY AND IMPRESSIVELY, ‚ÄÚYOU MAY REST ASSURED THAT I MEAN TO LISTEN TO YOU AT LEAST WITH INTEREST ‚Ä¶ AND I AM CONVINCED THAT I SHALL HEAR FROM YOU MUCH THAT IS NEW.‚ÄÙ

HE SAT DOWN ON A CHAIR.

‚ÄÚSIT DOWN!‚ÄÙ CRIED SHATOV, AND HE SAT DOWN HIMSELF.

‚ÄÚPLEASE REMEMBER,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN INTERPOSED ONCE MORE, ‚ÄÚTHAT I WAS ABOUT TO ASK A REAL FAVOUR OF YOU CONCERNING MARYA TIMOFYEVNA, OF GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR HER, ANYWAY.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT?‚ÄÙ SHATOV FROWNED SUDDENLY WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO HAS JUST BEEN INTERRUPTED AT THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT, AND WHO GAZES AT YOU UNABLE TO GRASP THE QUESTION.

‚ÄÚAND YOU DID NOT LET ME FINISH,‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WENT ON WITH A SMILE.

‚ÄÚOH, NONSENSE, AFTERWARDS!‚ÄÙ SHATOV WAVED HIS HAND DISDAINFULLY, GRASPING, AT LAST, WHAT HE WANTED, AND PASSED AT ONCE TO HIS PRINCIPAL THEME.

VII

‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW,‚ÄÙ HE BEGAN, WITH FLASHING EYES, ALMOST MENACINGLY, BENDING RIGHT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR, RAISING THE FOREFINGER OF HIS RIGHT HAND ABOVE HIM (OBVIOUSLY UNAWARE THAT HE WAS DOING SO), ‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW WHO ARE THE ONLY ‚ÄÒGOD-BEARING‚ÄÔ PEOPLE ON EARTH, DESTINED TO REGENERATE AND SAVE THE WORLD IN THE NAME OF A NEW GOD, AND TO WHOM ARE GIVEN THE KEYS OF LIFE AND OF THE NEW WORLD ‚Ä¶ DO YOU KNOW WHICH IS THAT PEOPLE AND WHAT IS ITS NAME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFROM YOUR MANNER I AM FORCED TO CONCLUDE, AND I THINK I MAY AS WELL DO SO AT ONCE, THAT IT IS THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND YOU CAN LAUGH, OH, WHAT A RACE!‚ÄÙ SHATOV BURST OUT.

‚ÄÚCALM YOURSELF, I BEG OF YOU; ON THE CONTRARY, I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING OF THE SORT FROM YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU EXPECTED SOMETHING OF THE SORT? AND DON‚ÄÔT YOU KNOW THOSE WORDS YOURSELF?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNOW THEM VERY WELL. I SEE ONLY TOO WELL WHAT YOU‚ÄÔRE DRIVING AT. ALL YOUR PHRASES, EVEN THE EXPRESSION ‚ÄÒGOD-BEARING PEOPLE‚ÄÔ IS ONLY A SEQUEL TO OUR TALK TWO YEARS AGO, ABROAD, NOT LONG BEFORE YOU WENT TO AMERICA.‚Ä¶ AT LEAST, AS FAR AS I CAN RECALL IT NOW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS YOUR PHRASE ALTOGETHER, NOT MINE. YOUR OWN, NOT SIMPLY THE SEQUEL OF OUR CONVERSATION. ‚ÄÒOUR‚ÄÔ CONVERSATION IT WAS NOT AT ALL. IT WAS A TEACHER UTTERING WEIGHTY WORDS, AND A PUPIL WHO WAS RAISED FROM THE DEAD. I WAS THAT PUPIL AND YOU WERE THE TEACHER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT, IF YOU REMEMBER, IT WAS JUST AFTER MY WORDS YOU JOINED THEIR SOCIETY, AND ONLY AFTERWARDS WENT AWAY TO AMERICA.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, AND I WROTE TO YOU FROM AMERICA ABOUT THAT. I WROTE TO YOU ABOUT EVERYTHING. YES, I COULD NOT AT ONCE TEAR MY BLEEDING HEART FROM WHAT I HAD GROWN INTO FROM CHILDHOOD, ON WHICH HAD BEEN LAVISHED ALL THE RAPTURES OF MY HOPES AND ALL THE TEARS OF MY HATRED.‚Ä¶ IT IS DIFFICULT TO CHANGE GODS. I DID NOT BELIEVE YOU THEN, BECAUSE I DID NOT WANT TO BELIEVE, I PLUNGED FOR THE LAST TIME INTO THAT SEWER.‚Ä¶ BUT THE SEED REMAINED AND GREW UP. SERIOUSLY, TELL ME SERIOUSLY, DIDN‚ÄÔT YOU READ ALL MY LETTER FROM AMERICA, PERHAPS YOU DIDN‚ÄÔT READ IT AT ALL?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI READ THREE PAGES OF IT. THE TWO FIRST AND THE LAST. AND I GLANCED THROUGH THE MIDDLE AS WELL. BUT I WAS ALWAYS MEANING ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAH, NEVER MIND, DROP IT! DAMN IT!‚ÄÙ CRIED SHATOV, WAVING HIS HAND. ‚ÄÚIF YOU‚ÄÔVE RENOUNCED THOSE WORDS ABOUT THE PEOPLE NOW, HOW COULD YOU HAVE UTTERED THEM THEN?‚Ä¶ THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT CRUSHES ME NOW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WASN‚ÄÔT JOKING WITH YOU THEN; IN PERSUADING YOU I WAS PERHAPS MORE CONCERNED WITH MYSELF THAN WITH YOU,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN PRONOUNCED ENIGMATICALLY.

‚ÄÚYOU WEREN‚ÄÔT JOKING! IN AMERICA I WAS LYING FOR THREE MONTHS ON STRAW BESIDE A HAPLESS CREATURE, AND I LEARNT FROM HIM THAT AT THE VERY TIME WHEN YOU WERE SOWING THE SEED OF GOD AND THE FATHERLAND IN MY HEART, AT THAT VERY TIME, PERHAPS DURING THOSE VERY DAYS, YOU WERE INFECTING THE HEART OF THAT HAPLESS CREATURE, THAT MANIAC KIRILLOV, WITH POISON ‚Ä¶ YOU CONFIRMED FALSE MALIGNANT IDEAS IN HIM, AND BROUGHT HIM TO THE VERGE OF INSANITY.‚Ä¶ GO, LOOK AT HIM NOW, HE IS YOUR CREATION ‚Ä¶ YOU‚ÄÔVE SEEN HIM THOUGH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIN THE FIRST PLACE, I MUST OBSERVE THAT KIRILLOV HIMSELF TOLD ME THAT HE IS HAPPY AND THAT HE‚ÄÔS GOOD. YOUR SUPPOSITION THAT ALL THIS WAS GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME IS ALMOST CORRECT. BUT WHAT OF IT? I REPEAT, I WAS NOT DECEIVING EITHER OF YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚARE YOU AN ATHEIST? AN ATHEIST NOW?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND THEN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚJUST AS I WAS THEN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WASN‚ÄÔT ASKING YOU TO TREAT ME WITH RESPECT WHEN I BEGAN THE CONVERSATION. WITH YOUR INTELLECT YOU MIGHT HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT,‚ÄÙ SHATOV MUTTERED INDIGNANTLY.

‚ÄÚI DIDN‚ÄÔT GET UP AT YOUR FIRST WORD, I DIDN‚ÄÔT CLOSE THE CONVERSATION, I DIDN‚ÄÔT GO AWAY FROM YOU, BUT HAVE BEEN SITTING HERE EVER SINCE SUBMISSIVELY ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS AND ‚Ä¶ CRIES, SO IT SEEMS I HAVE NOT BEEN LACKING IN RESPECT TO YOU YET.‚ÄÙ

SHATOV INTERRUPTED, WAVING HIS HAND.

‚ÄÚDO YOU REMEMBER YOUR EXPRESSION THAT ‚ÄÒAN ATHEIST CAN‚ÄÔT BE A RUSSIAN,‚ÄÔ THAT ‚ÄÒAN ATHEIST AT ONCE CEASES TO BE A RUSSIAN‚ÄÔ? DO YOU REMEMBER SAYING THAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDID I?‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH QUESTIONED HIM BACK.

‚ÄÚYOU ASK? YOU‚ÄÔVE FORGOTTEN? AND YET THAT WAS ONE OF THE TRUEST STATEMENTS OF THE LEADING PECULIARITY OF THE RUSSIAN SOUL, WHICH YOU DIVINED. YOU CAN‚ÄÔT HAVE FORGOTTEN IT! I WILL REMIND YOU OF SOMETHING ELSE: YOU SAID THEN THAT ‚ÄÒA MAN WHO WAS NOT ORTHODOX COULD NOT BE RUSSIAN.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI IMAGINE THAT‚ÄÔS A SLAVOPHIL IDEA.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE SLAVOPHILS OF TO-DAY DISOWN IT. NOWADAYS, PEOPLE HAVE GROWN CLEVERER. BUT YOU WENT FURTHER: YOU BELIEVED THAT ROMAN CATHOLICISM WAS NOT CHRISTIANITY; YOU ASSERTED THAT ROME PROCLAIMED CHRIST SUBJECT TO THE THIRD TEMPTATION OF THE DEVIL. ANNOUNCING TO ALL THE WORLD THAT CHRIST WITHOUT AN EARTHLY KINGDOM CANNOT HOLD HIS GROUND UPON EARTH, CATHOLICISM BY SO DOING PROCLAIMED ANTICHRIST AND RUINED THE WHOLE WESTERN WORLD. YOU POINTED OUT THAT IF FRANCE IS IN AGONIES NOW IT‚ÄÔS SIMPLY THE FAULT OF CATHOLICISM, FOR SHE HAS REJECTED THE INIQUITOUS GOD OF ROME AND HAS NOT FOUND A NEW ONE. THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT YOU COULD SAY THEN! I REMEMBER OUR CONVERSATIONS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF I BELIEVED, NO DOUBT I SHOULD REPEAT IT EVEN NOW. I WASN‚ÄÔT LYING WHEN I SPOKE AS THOUGH I HAD FAITH,‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH PRONOUNCED VERY EARNESTLY. ‚ÄÚBUT I MUST TELL YOU, THIS REPETITION OF MY IDEAS IN THE PAST MAKES A VERY DISAGREEABLE IMPRESSION ON ME. CAN‚ÄÔT YOU LEAVE OFF?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF YOU BELIEVE IT?‚ÄÙ REPEATED SHATOV, PAYING NOT THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION TO THIS REQUEST. ‚ÄÚBUT DIDN‚ÄÔT YOU TELL ME THAT IF IT WERE MATHEMATICALLY PROVED TO YOU THAT THE TRUTH EXCLUDES CHRIST, YOU‚ÄÔD PREFER TO STICK TO CHRIST RATHER THAN TO THE TRUTH? DID YOU SAY THAT? DID YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT ALLOW ME TOO AT LAST TO ASK A QUESTION,‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, RAISING HIS VOICE. ‚ÄÚWHAT IS THE OBJECT OF THIS IRRITABLE AND ‚Ä¶ MALICIOUS CROSS-EXAMINATION?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHIS EXAMINATION WILL BE OVER FOR ALL ETERNITY, AND YOU WILL NEVER HEAR IT MENTIONED AGAIN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU KEEP INSISTING THAT WE ARE OUTSIDE THE LIMITS OF TIME AND SPACE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOLD YOUR TONGUE!‚ÄÙ SHATOV CRIED SUDDENLY. ‚ÄÚI AM STUPID AND AWKWARD, BUT LET MY NAME PERISH IN IGNOMINY! LET ME REPEAT YOUR LEADING IDEA.‚Ä¶ OH, ONLY A DOZEN LINES, ONLY THE CONCLUSION.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚREPEAT IT, IF IT‚ÄÔS ONLY THE CONCLUSION.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN MADE A MOVEMENT TO LOOK AT HIS WATCH, BUT RESTRAINED HIMSELF AND DID NOT LOOK.

SHATOV BENT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN AND AGAIN HELD UP HIS FINGER FOR A MOMENT.

‚ÄÚNOT A SINGLE NATION,‚ÄÙ HE WENT ON, AS THOUGH READING IT LINE BY LINE, STILL GAZING MENACINGLY AT STAVROGIN, ‚ÄÚNOT A SINGLE NATION HAS EVER BEEN FOUNDED ON PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE OR REASON. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AN EXAMPLE OF IT, EXCEPT FOR A BRIEF MOMENT, THROUGH FOLLY. SOCIALISM IS FROM ITS VERY NATURE BOUND TO BE ATHEISM, SEEING THAT IT HAS FROM THE VERY FIRST PROCLAIMED THAT IT IS AN ATHEISTIC ORGANISATION OF SOCIETY, AND THAT IT INTENDS TO ESTABLISH ITSELF EXCLUSIVELY ON THE ELEMENTS OF SCIENCE AND REASON. SCIENCE AND REASON HAVE, FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME, PLAYED A SECONDARY AND SUBORDINATE PART IN THE LIFE OF NATIONS; SO IT WILL BE TILL THE END OF TIME. NATIONS ARE BUILT UP AND MOVED BY ANOTHER FORCE WHICH SWAYS AND DOMINATES THEM, THE ORIGIN OF WHICH IS UNKNOWN AND INEXPLICABLE: THAT FORCE IS THE FORCE OF AN INSATIABLE DESIRE TO GO ON TO THE END, THOUGH AT THE SAME TIME IT DENIES THAT END. IT IS THE FORCE OF THE PERSISTENT ASSERTION OF ONE‚ÄÔS OWN EXISTENCE, AND A DENIAL OF DEATH. IT‚ÄÔS THE SPIRIT OF LIFE, AS THE SCRIPTURES CALL IT, ‚ÄÒTHE RIVER OF LIVING WATER,‚ÄÔ THE DRYING UP OF WHICH IS THREATENED IN THE APOCALYPSE. IT‚ÄÔS THE √¶STHETIC PRINCIPLE, AS THE PHILOSOPHERS CALL IT, THE ETHICAL PRINCIPLE WITH WHICH THEY IDENTIFY IT, ‚ÄÒTHE SEEKING FOR GOD,‚ÄÔ AS I CALL IT MORE SIMPLY. THE OBJECT OF EVERY NATIONAL MOVEMENT, IN EVERY PEOPLE AND AT EVERY PERIOD OF ITS EXISTENCE IS ONLY THE SEEKING FOR ITS GOD, WHO MUST BE ITS OWN GOD, AND THE FAITH IN HIM AS THE ONLY TRUE ONE. GOD IS THE SYNTHETIC PERSONALITY OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE, TAKEN FROM ITS BEGINNING TO ITS END. IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED THAT ALL, OR EVEN MANY, PEOPLES HAVE HAD ONE COMMON GOD, BUT EACH HAS ALWAYS HAD ITS OWN. IT‚ÄÔS A SIGN OF THE DECAY OF NATIONS WHEN THEY BEGIN TO HAVE GODS IN COMMON. WHEN GODS BEGIN TO BE COMMON TO SEVERAL NATIONS THE GODS ARE DYING AND THE FAITH IN THEM, TOGETHER WITH THE NATIONS THEMSELVES. THE STRONGER A PEOPLE THE MORE INDIVIDUAL THEIR GOD. THERE NEVER HAS BEEN A NATION WITHOUT A RELIGION, THAT IS, WITHOUT AN IDEA OF GOOD AND EVIL. EVERY PEOPLE HAS ITS OWN CONCEPTION OF GOOD AND EVIL, AND ITS OWN GOOD AND EVIL. WHEN THE SAME CONCEPTIONS OF GOOD AND EVIL BECOME PREVALENT IN SEVERAL NATIONS, THEN THESE NATIONS ARE DYING, AND THEN THE VERY DISTINCTION BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL IS BEGINNING TO DISAPPEAR. REASON HAS NEVER HAD THE POWER TO DEFINE GOOD AND EVIL, OR EVEN TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL, EVEN APPROXIMATELY; ON THE CONTRARY, IT HAS ALWAYS MIXED THEM UP IN A DISGRACEFUL AND PITIFUL WAY; SCIENCE HAS EVEN GIVEN THE SOLUTION BY THE FIST. THIS IS PARTICULARLY CHARACTERISTIC OF THE HALF-TRUTHS OF SCIENCE, THE MOST TERRIBLE SCOURGE OF HUMANITY, UNKNOWN TILL THIS CENTURY, AND WORSE THAN PLAGUE, FAMINE, OR WAR. A HALF-TRUTH IS A DESPOT ‚Ä¶ SUCH AS HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE WORLD BEFORE. A DESPOT THAT HAS ITS PRIESTS AND ITS SLAVES, A DESPOT TO WHOM ALL DO HOMAGE WITH LOVE AND SUPERSTITION HITHERTO INCONCEIVABLE, BEFORE WHICH SCIENCE ITSELF TREMBLES AND CRINGES IN A SHAMEFUL WAY. THESE ARE YOUR OWN WORDS, STAVROGIN, ALL EXCEPT THAT ABOUT THE HALF-TRUTH; THAT‚ÄÔS MY OWN BECAUSE I AM MYSELF A CASE OF HALF-KNOWLEDGE, AND THAT‚ÄÔS WHY I HATE IT PARTICULARLY. I HAVEN‚ÄÔT ALTERED ANYTHING OF YOUR IDEAS OR EVEN OF YOUR WORDS, NOT A SYLLABLE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT AGREE THAT YOU‚ÄÔVE NOT ALTERED ANYTHING,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN OBSERVED CAUTIOUSLY. ‚ÄÚYOU ACCEPTED THEM WITH ARDOUR, AND IN YOUR ARDOUR HAVE TRANSFORMED THEM UNCONSCIOUSLY. THE VERY FACT THAT YOU REDUCE GOD TO A SIMPLE ATTRIBUTE OF NATIONALITY ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

HE SUDDENLY BEGAN WATCHING SHATOV WITH INTENSE AND PECULIAR ATTENTION, NOT SO MUCH HIS WORDS AS HIMSELF.

‚ÄÚI REDUCE GOD TO THE ATTRIBUTE OF NATIONALITY?‚ÄÙ CRIED SHATOV. ‚ÄÚON THE CONTRARY, I RAISE THE PEOPLE TO GOD. AND HAS IT EVER BEEN OTHERWISE? THE PEOPLE IS THE BODY OF GOD. EVERY PEOPLE IS ONLY A PEOPLE SO LONG AS IT HAS ITS OWN GOD AND EXCLUDES ALL OTHER GODS ON EARTH IRRECONCILABLY; SO LONG AS IT BELIEVES THAT BY ITS GOD IT WILL CONQUER AND DRIVE OUT OF THE WORLD ALL OTHER GODS. SUCH, FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME, HAS BEEN THE BELIEF OF ALL GREAT NATIONS, ALL, ANYWAY, WHO HAVE BEEN SPECIALLY REMARKABLE, ALL WHO HAVE BEEN LEADERS OF HUMANITY. THERE IS NO GOING AGAINST FACTS. THE JEWS LIVED ONLY TO AWAIT THE COMING OF THE TRUE GOD AND LEFT THE WORLD THE TRUE GOD. THE GREEKS DEIFIED NATURE AND BEQUEATHED THE WORLD THEIR RELIGION, THAT IS, PHILOSOPHY AND ART. ROME DEIFIED THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE, AND BEQUEATHED THE IDEA OF THE STATE TO THE NATIONS. FRANCE THROUGHOUT HER LONG HISTORY WAS ONLY THE INCARNATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ROMAN GOD, AND IF THEY HAVE AT LAST FLUNG THEIR ROMAN GOD INTO THE ABYSS AND PLUNGED INTO ATHEISM, WHICH, FOR THE TIME BEING, THEY CALL SOCIALISM, IT IS SOLELY BECAUSE SOCIALISM IS, ANYWAY, HEALTHIER THAN ROMAN CATHOLICISM. IF A GREAT PEOPLE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE TRUTH IS ONLY TO BE FOUND IN ITSELF ALONE (IN ITSELF ALONE AND IN IT EXCLUSIVELY); IF IT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT IT ALONE IS FIT AND DESTINED TO RAISE UP AND SAVE ALL THE REST BY ITS TRUTH, IT WOULD AT ONCE SINK INTO BEING ETHNOGRAPHICAL MATERIAL, AND NOT A GREAT PEOPLE. A REALLY GREAT PEOPLE CAN NEVER ACCEPT A SECONDARY PART IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY, NOR EVEN ONE OF THE FIRST, BUT WILL HAVE THE FIRST PART. A NATION WHICH LOSES THIS BELIEF CEASES TO BE A NATION. BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE TRUTH, AND THEREFORE ONLY A SINGLE ONE OUT OF THE NATIONS CAN HAVE THE TRUE GOD, EVEN THOUGH OTHER NATIONS MAY HAVE GREAT GODS OF THEIR OWN. ONLY ONE NATION IS ‚ÄÒGOD-BEARING,‚ÄÔ THAT‚ÄÔS THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE, AND ‚Ä¶ AND ‚Ä¶ AND CAN YOU THINK ME SUCH A FOOL, STAVROGIN,‚ÄÙ HE YELLED FRANTICALLY ALL AT ONCE, ‚ÄÚTHAT I CAN‚ÄÔT DISTINGUISH WHETHER MY WORDS AT THIS MOMENT ARE THE ROTTEN OLD COMMONPLACES THAT HAVE BEEN GROUND OUT IN ALL THE SLAVOPHIL MILLS IN MOSCOW, OR A PERFECTLY NEW SAYING, THE LAST WORD, THE SOLE WORD OF RENEWAL AND RESURRECTION, AND ‚Ä¶ AND WHAT DO I CARE FOR YOUR LAUGHTER AT THIS MINUTE! WHAT DO I CARE THAT YOU UTTERLY, UTTERLY FAIL TO UNDERSTAND ME, NOT A WORD, NOT A SOUND! OH, HOW I DESPISE YOUR HAUGHTY LAUGHTER AND YOUR LOOK AT THIS MINUTE!‚ÄÙ

HE JUMPED UP FROM HIS SEAT; THERE WAS POSITIVELY FOAM ON HIS LIPS.

‚ÄÚON THE CONTRARY SHATOV, ON THE CONTRARY,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN BEGAN WITH EXTRAORDINARY EARNESTNESS AND SELF-CONTROL, STILL KEEPING HIS SEAT, ‚ÄÚON THE CONTRARY, YOUR FERVENT WORDS HAVE REVIVED MANY EXTREMELY POWERFUL RECOLLECTIONS IN ME. IN YOUR WORDS I RECOGNISE MY OWN MOOD TWO YEARS AGO, AND NOW I WILL NOT TELL YOU, AS I DID JUST NOW, THAT YOU HAVE EXAGGERATED MY IDEAS. I BELIEVE, INDEED, THAT THEY WERE EVEN MORE EXCEPTIONAL, EVEN MORE INDEPENDENT, AND I ASSURE YOU FOR THE THIRD TIME THAT I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO CONFIRM ALL THAT YOU‚ÄÔVE SAID JUST NOW, EVERY SYLLABLE OF IT, BUT ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT YOU WANT A HARE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWH-A-T?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOUR OWN NASTY EXPRESSION,‚ÄÙ SHATOV LAUGHED SPITEFULLY, SITTING DOWN AGAIN. ‚ÄÚTO COOK YOUR HARE YOU MUST FIRST CATCH IT, TO BELIEVE IN GOD YOU MUST FIRST HAVE A GOD. YOU USED TO SAY THAT IN PETERSBURG, I‚ÄÔM TOLD, LIKE NOZDRYOV, WHO TRIED TO CATCH A HARE BY HIS HIND LEGS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, WHAT HE DID WAS TO BOAST HE‚ÄÔD CAUGHT HIM. BY THE WAY, ALLOW ME TO TROUBLE YOU WITH A QUESTION THOUGH, FOR INDEED I THINK I HAVE THE RIGHT TO ONE NOW. TELL ME, HAVE YOU CAUGHT YOUR HARE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT DARE TO ASK ME IN SUCH WORDS! ASK DIFFERENTLY, QUITE DIFFERENTLY.‚ÄÙ SHATOV SUDDENLY BEGAN TREMBLING ALL OVER.

‚ÄÚCERTAINLY I‚ÄÔLL ASK DIFFERENTLY.‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH LOOKED COLDLY AT HIM. ‚ÄÚI ONLY WANTED TO KNOW, DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD, YOURSELF?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI BELIEVE IN RUSSIA.‚Ä¶ I BELIEVE IN HER ORTHODOXY.‚Ä¶ I BELIEVE IN THE BODY OF CHRIST.‚Ä¶ I BELIEVE THAT THE NEW ADVENT WILL TAKE PLACE IN RUSSIA.‚Ä¶ I BELIEVE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ SHATOV MUTTERED FRANTICALLY.

‚ÄÚAND IN GOD? IN GOD?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI ‚Ä¶ I WILL BELIEVE IN GOD.‚ÄÙ

NOT ONE MUSCLE MOVED IN STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS FACE. SHATOV LOOKED PASSIONATELY AND DEFIANTLY AT HIM, AS THOUGH HE WOULD HAVE SCORCHED HIM WITH HIS EYES.

‚ÄÚI HAVEN‚ÄÔT TOLD YOU THAT I DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED AT LAST. ‚ÄÚI WILL ONLY HAVE YOU KNOW THAT I AM A LUCKLESS, TEDIOUS BOOK, AND NOTHING MORE SO FAR, SO FAR.‚Ä¶ BUT CONFOUND ME! WE‚ÄÔRE DISCUSSING YOU NOT ME.‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔM A MAN OF NO TALENT, AND CAN ONLY GIVE MY BLOOD, NOTHING MORE, LIKE EVERY MAN WITHOUT TALENT; NEVER MIND MY BLOOD EITHER! I‚ÄÔM TALKING ABOUT YOU. I‚ÄÔVE BEEN WAITING HERE TWO YEARS FOR YOU.‚Ä¶ HERE I‚ÄÔVE BEEN DANCING ABOUT IN MY NAKEDNESS BEFORE YOU FOR THE LAST HALF-HOUR. YOU, ONLY YOU CAN RAISE THAT FLAG!‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

HE BROKE OFF, AND SAT AS THOUGH IN DESPAIR, WITH HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS.

‚ÄÚI MERELY MENTION IT AS SOMETHING QUEER,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN INTERRUPTED SUDDENLY. ‚ÄÚEVERY ONE FOR SOME INEXPLICABLE REASON KEEPS FOISTING A FLAG UPON ME. PYOTR VERHOVENSKY, TOO, IS CONVINCED THAT I MIGHT ‚ÄÒRAISE HIS FLAG,‚ÄÔ THAT‚ÄÔS HOW HIS WORDS WERE REPEATED TO ME, ANYWAY. HE HAS TAKEN IT INTO HIS HEAD THAT I‚ÄÔM CAPABLE OF PLAYING THE PART OF STENKA RAZIN FOR THEM, ‚ÄÒFROM MY EXTRAORDINARY APTITUDE FOR CRIME,‚ÄÔ HIS SAYING TOO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT?‚ÄÙ CRIED SHATOV, ‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒFROM YOUR EXTRAORDINARY APTITUDE FOR CRIME‚ÄÔ?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚJUST SO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚH‚ÄÔM! AND IS IT TRUE?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED, WITH AN ANGRY SMILE. ‚ÄÚIS IT TRUE THAT WHEN YOU WERE IN PETERSBURG YOU BELONGED TO A SECRET SOCIETY FOR PRACTISING BEASTLY SENSUALITY? IS IT TRUE THAT YOU COULD GIVE LESSONS TO THE MARQUIS DE SADE? IS IT TRUE THAT YOU DECOYED AND CORRUPTED CHILDREN? SPEAK, DON‚ÄÔT DARE TO LIE,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, BESIDE HIMSELF. ‚ÄÚNIKOLAY STAVROGIN CANNOT LIE TO SHATOV, WHO STRUCK HIM IN THE FACE. TELL ME EVERYTHING, AND IF IT‚ÄÔS TRUE I‚ÄÔLL KILL YOU, HERE, ON THE SPOT!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DID TALK LIKE THAT, BUT IT WAS NOT I WHO OUTRAGED CHILDREN,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN BROUGHT OUT, AFTER A SILENCE THAT LASTED TOO LONG. HE TURNED PALE AND HIS EYES GLEAMED.

‚ÄÚBUT YOU TALKED LIKE THAT,‚ÄÙ SHATOV WENT ON IMPERIOUSLY, KEEPING HIS FLASHING EYES FASTENED UPON HIM. ‚ÄÚIS IT TRUE THAT YOU DECLARED THAT YOU SAW NO DISTINCTION IN BEAUTY BETWEEN SOME BRUTAL OBSCENE ACTION AND ANY GREAT EXPLOIT, EVEN THE SACRIFICE OF LIFE FOR THE GOOD OF HUMANITY? IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE FOUND IDENTICAL BEAUTY, EQUAL ENJOYMENT, IN BOTH EXTREMES?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS IMPOSSIBLE TO ANSWER LIKE THIS.‚Ä¶ I WON‚ÄÔT ANSWER,‚ÄÙ MUTTERED STAVROGIN, WHO MIGHT WELL HAVE GOT UP AND GONE AWAY, BUT WHO DID NOT GET UP AND GO AWAY.

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT KNOW EITHER WHY EVIL IS HATEFUL AND GOOD IS BEAUTIFUL, BUT I KNOW WHY THE SENSE OF THAT DISTINCTION IS EFFACED AND LOST IN PEOPLE LIKE THE STAVROGINS,‚ÄÙ SHATOV PERSISTED, TREMBLING ALL OVER. ‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW WHY YOU MADE THAT BASE AND SHAMEFUL MARRIAGE? SIMPLY BECAUSE THE SHAME AND SENSELESSNESS OF IT REACHED THE PITCH OF GENIUS! OH, YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO LINGER ON THE BRINK. YOU FLY HEAD FOREMOST. YOU MARRIED FROM A PASSION FOR MARTYRDOM, FROM A CRAVING FOR REMORSE, THROUGH MORAL SENSUALITY. IT WAS A LACERATION OF THE NERVES ‚Ä¶ DEFIANCE OF COMMON SENSE WAS TOO TEMPTING. STAVROGIN AND A WRETCHED, HALF-WITTED, CRIPPLED BEGGAR! WHEN YOU BIT THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS EAR DID YOU FEEL SENSUAL PLEASURE? DID YOU? YOU IDLE, LOAFING, LITTLE SNOB. DID YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE A PSYCHOLOGIST,‚ÄÙ SAID STAVROGIN, TURNING PALER AND PALER, ‚ÄÚTHOUGH YOU‚ÄÔRE PARTLY MISTAKEN AS TO THE REASONS OF MY MARRIAGE. BUT WHO CAN HAVE GIVEN YOU ALL THIS INFORMATION?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED, SMILING, WITH AN EFFORT. ‚ÄÚWAS IT KIRILLOV? BUT HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU TURN PALE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT WHAT IS IT YOU WANT?‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH ASKED, RAISING HIS VOICE AT LAST. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE BEEN SITTING UNDER YOUR LASH FOR THE LAST HALF-HOUR, AND YOU MIGHT AT LEAST LET ME GO CIVILLY. UNLESS YOU REALLY HAVE SOME REASONABLE OBJECT IN TREATING ME LIKE THIS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚREASONABLE OBJECT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOF COURSE, YOU‚ÄÔRE IN DUTY BOUND, ANYWAY, TO LET ME KNOW YOUR OBJECT. I‚ÄÔVE BEEN EXPECTING YOU TO DO SO ALL THE TIME, BUT YOU‚ÄÔVE SHOWN ME NOTHING SO FAR BUT FRENZIED SPITE. I BEG YOU TO OPEN THE GATE FOR ME.‚ÄÙ

HE GOT UP FROM THE CHAIR. SHATOV RUSHED FRANTICALLY AFTER HIM. ‚ÄÚKISS THE EARTH, WATER IT WITH YOUR TEARS, PRAY FOR FORGIVENESS,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, CLUTCHING HIM BY THE SHOULDER.

‚ÄÚI DIDN‚ÄÔT KILL YOU ‚Ä¶ THAT MORNING, THOUGH ‚Ä¶ I DREW BACK MY HANDS ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN BROUGHT OUT ALMOST WITH ANGUISH, KEEPING HIS EYES ON THE GROUND.

‚ÄÚSPEAK OUT! SPEAK OUT! YOU CAME TO WARN ME OF DANGER. YOU HAVE LET ME SPEAK. YOU MEAN TO-MORROW TO ANNOUNCE YOUR MARRIAGE PUBLICLY.‚Ä¶ DO YOU SUPPOSE I DON‚ÄÔT SEE FROM YOUR FACE THAT SOME NEW MENACING IDEA IS DOMINATING YOU?‚Ä¶ STAVROGIN, WHY AM I CONDEMNED TO BELIEVE IN YOU THROUGH ALL ETERNITY? COULD I SPEAK LIKE THIS TO ANYONE ELSE? I HAVE MODESTY, BUT I AM NOT ASHAMED OF MY NAKEDNESS BECAUSE IT‚ÄÔS STAVROGIN I AM SPEAKING TO. I WAS NOT AFRAID OF CARICATURING A GRAND IDEA BY HANDLING IT BECAUSE STAVROGIN WAS LISTENING TO ME.‚Ä¶ SHAN‚ÄÔT I KISS YOUR FOOTPRINTS WHEN YOU‚ÄÔVE GONE? I CAN‚ÄÔT TEAR YOU OUT OF MY HEART, NIKOLAY STAVROGIN!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM SORRY I CAN‚ÄÔT FEEL AFFECTION FOR YOU, SHATOV,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN REPLIED COLDLY.

‚ÄÚI KNOW YOU CAN‚ÄÔT, AND I KNOW YOU ARE NOT LYING. LISTEN. I CAN SET IT ALL RIGHT. I CAN ‚ÄÒCATCH YOUR HARE‚ÄÔ FOR YOU.‚ÄÙ

STAVROGIN DID NOT SPEAK.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE AN ATHEIST BECAUSE YOU‚ÄÔRE A SNOB, A SNOB OF THE SNOBS. YOU‚ÄÔVE LOST THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL BECAUSE YOU‚ÄÔVE LOST TOUCH WITH YOUR OWN PEOPLE. A NEW GENERATION IS COMING, STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART OF THE PEOPLE, AND YOU WILL KNOW NOTHING OF IT, NEITHER YOU NOR THE VERHOVENSKYS, FATHER OR SON; NOR I, FOR I‚ÄÔM A SNOB TOO‚ÄÎI, THE SON OF YOUR SERF AND LACKEY, PASHKA.‚Ä¶ LISTEN. ATTAIN TO GOD BY WORK; IT ALL LIES IN THAT; OR DISAPPEAR LIKE ROTTEN MILDEW. ATTAIN TO HIM BY WORK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGOD BY WORK? WHAT SORT OF WORK?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPEASANTS‚ÄÔ WORK. GO, GIVE UP ALL YOUR WEALTH.‚Ä¶ AH! YOU LAUGH, YOU‚ÄÔRE AFRAID OF SOME TRICK?‚ÄÙ

BUT STAVROGIN WAS NOT LAUGHING.

‚ÄÚYOU SUPPOSE THAT ONE MAY ATTAIN TO GOD BY WORK, AND BY PEASANTS‚ÄÔ WORK,‚ÄÙ HE REPEATED, REFLECTING AS THOUGH HE HAD REALLY COME ACROSS SOMETHING NEW AND SERIOUS WHICH WAS WORTH CONSIDERING. ‚ÄÚBY THE WAY,‚ÄÙ HE PASSED SUDDENLY TO A NEW IDEA, ‚ÄÚYOU REMINDED ME JUST NOW. DO YOU KNOW THAT I‚ÄÔM NOT RICH AT ALL, THAT I‚ÄÔVE NOTHING TO GIVE UP? I‚ÄÔM SCARCELY IN A POSITION EVEN TO PROVIDE FOR MARYA TIMOFYEVNA‚ÄÔS FUTURE.‚Ä¶ ANOTHER THING: I CAME TO ASK YOU IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO REMAIN NEAR MARYA TIMOFYEVNA IN THE FUTURE, AS YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS SOME INFLUENCE OVER HER POOR BRAIN. I SAY THIS SO AS TO BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. YOU‚ÄÔRE SPEAKING OF MARYA TIMOFYEVNA,‚ÄÙ SAID SHATOV, WAVING ONE HAND, WHILE HE HELD A CANDLE IN THE OTHER. ‚ÄÚALL RIGHT. AFTERWARDS, OF COURSE.‚Ä¶ LISTEN. GO TO TIKHON.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO WHOM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO TIKHON, WHO USED TO BE A BISHOP. HE LIVES RETIRED NOW, ON ACCOUNT OF ILLNESS, HERE IN THE TOWN, IN THE BOGORODSKY MONASTERY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU MEAN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOTHING. PEOPLE GO AND SEE HIM. YOU GO. WHAT IS IT TO YOU? WHAT IS IT TO YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS THE FIRST TIME I‚ÄÔVE HEARD OF HIM, AND ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING OF THAT SORT OF PEOPLE. THANK YOU, I‚ÄÔLL GO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHIS WAY.‚ÄÙ

SHATOV LIGHTED HIM DOWN THE STAIRS. ‚ÄÚGO ALONG.‚ÄÙ HE FLUNG OPEN THE GATE INTO THE STREET.

‚ÄÚI SHAN‚ÄÔT COME TO YOU ANY MORE, SHATOV,‚ÄÙ SAID STAVROGIN QUIETLY AS HE STEPPED THROUGH THE GATEWAY.

THE DARKNESS AND THE RAIN CONTINUED AS BEFORE.





CHAPTER II. NIGHT (CONTINUED)

I

HE WALKED THE LENGTH OF BOGOYAVLENSKY STREET. AT LAST THE ROAD BEGAN TO GO DOWNHILL; HIS FEET SLIPPED IN THE MUD AND SUDDENLY THERE LAY OPEN BEFORE HIM A WIDE, MISTY, AS IT WERE EMPTY EXPANSE‚ÄÎTHE RIVER. THE HOUSES WERE REPLACED BY HOVELS; THE STREET WAS LOST IN A MULTITUDE OF IRREGULAR LITTLE ALLEYS.

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS A LONG WHILE MAKING HIS WAY BETWEEN THE FENCES, KEEPING CLOSE TO THE RIVER BANK, BUT FINDING HIS WAY CONFIDENTLY, AND SCARCELY GIVING IT A THOUGHT INDEED. HE WAS ABSORBED IN SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT, AND LOOKED ROUND WITH SURPRISE WHEN SUDDENLY, WAKING UP FROM A PROFOUND REVERIE, HE FOUND HIMSELF ALMOST IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE LONG, WET, FLOATING BRIDGE.

THERE WAS NOT A SOUL TO BE SEEN, SO THAT IT SEEMED STRANGE TO HIM WHEN SUDDENLY, ALMOST AT HIS ELBOW, HE HEARD A DEFERENTIALLY FAMILIAR, BUT RATHER PLEASANT, VOICE, WITH A SUAVE INTONATION, SUCH AS IS AFFECTED BY OUR OVER-REFINED TRADESPEOPLE OR BEFRIZZLED YOUNG SHOP ASSISTANTS.

‚ÄÚWILL YOU KINDLY ALLOW ME, SIR, TO SHARE YOUR UMBRELLA?‚ÄÙ

THERE ACTUALLY WAS A FIGURE THAT CREPT UNDER HIS UMBRELLA, OR TRIED TO APPEAR TO DO SO. THE TRAMP WAS WALKING BESIDE HIM, ALMOST ‚ÄÚFEELING HIS ELBOW,‚ÄÙ AS THE SOLDIERS SAY. SLACKENING HIS PACE, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH BENT DOWN TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY, AS FAR AS HE COULD, IN THE DARKNESS. IT WAS A SHORT MAN, AND SEEMED LIKE AN ARTISAN WHO HAD BEEN DRINKING; HE WAS SHABBILY AND SCANTILY DRESSED; A CLOTH CAP, SOAKED BY THE RAIN AND WITH THE BRIM HALF TORN OFF, PERCHED ON HIS SHAGGY, CURLY HEAD. HE LOOKED A THIN, VIGOROUS, SWARTHY MAN WITH DARK HAIR; HIS EYES WERE LARGE AND MUST HAVE BEEN BLACK, WITH A HARD GLITTER AND A YELLOW TINGE IN THEM, LIKE A GIPSY‚ÄÔS; THAT COULD BE DIVINED EVEN IN THE DARKNESS. HE WAS ABOUT FORTY, AND WAS NOT DRUNK.

‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW ME?‚ÄÙ ASKED NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH. ‚ÄÚMR. STAVROGIN, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH. YOU WERE POINTED OUT TO ME AT THE STATION, WHEN THE TRAIN STOPPED LAST SUNDAY, THOUGH I HAD HEARD ENOUGH OF YOU BEFOREHAND.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFROM PYOTR STEPANOVITCH? ARE YOU ‚Ä¶ FEDKA THE CONVICT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WAS CHRISTENED FYODOR FYODOROVITCH. MY MOTHER IS LIVING TO THIS DAY IN THESE PARTS; SHE‚ÄÔS AN OLD WOMAN, AND GROWS MORE AND MORE BENT EVERY DAY. SHE PRAYS TO GOD FOR ME, DAY AND NIGHT, SO THAT SHE DOESN‚ÄÔT WASTE HER OLD AGE LYING ON THE STOVE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ESCAPED FROM PRISON?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE HAD A CHANGE OF LUCK. I GAVE UP BOOKS AND BELLS AND CHURCH-GOING BECAUSE I‚ÄÔD A LIFE SENTENCE, SO THAT I HAD A VERY LONG TIME TO FINISH MY TERM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, I DO WHAT I CAN. MY UNCLE, TOO, DIED LAST WEEK IN PRISON HERE. HE WAS THERE FOR FALSE COIN, SO I THREW TWO DOZEN STONES AT THE DOGS BY WAY OF MEMORIAL. THAT‚ÄÔS ALL I‚ÄÔVE BEEN DOING SO FAR. MOREOVER PYOTR STEPANOVITCH GIVES ME HOPES OF A PASSPORT, AND A MERCHANT‚ÄÔS ONE, TOO, TO GO ALL OVER RUSSIA, SO I‚ÄÔM WAITING ON HIS KINDNESS. ‚ÄÒBECAUSE,‚ÄÔ SAYS HE, ‚ÄÒMY PAPA LOST YOU AT CARDS AT THE ENGLISH CLUB, AND I,‚ÄÔ SAYS HE, ‚ÄÒFIND THAT INHUMANITY UNJUST.‚ÄÔ YOU MIGHT HAVE THE KINDNESS TO GIVE ME THREE ROUBLES, SIR, FOR A GLASS TO WARM MYSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSO YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN SPYING ON ME. I DON‚ÄÔT LIKE THAT. BY WHOSE ORDERS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAS TO ORDERS, IT‚ÄÔS NOTHING OF THE SORT; IT‚ÄÔS SIMPLY THAT I KNEW OF YOUR BENEVOLENCE, WHICH IS KNOWN TO ALL THE WORLD. ALL WE GET, AS YOU KNOW, IS AN ARMFUL OF HAY, OR A PROD WITH A FORK. LAST FRIDAY I FILLED MYSELF AS FULL OF PIE AS MARTIN DID OF SOAP; SINCE THEN I DIDN‚ÄÔT EAT ONE DAY, AND THE DAY AFTER I FASTED, AND ON THE THIRD I‚ÄÔD NOTHING AGAIN. I‚ÄÔVE HAD MY FILL OF WATER FROM THE RIVER. I‚ÄÔM BREEDING FISH IN MY BELLY.‚Ä¶ SO WON‚ÄÔT YOUR HONOUR GIVE ME SOMETHING? I‚ÄÔVE A SWEETHEART EXPECTING ME NOT FAR FROM HERE, BUT I DAREN‚ÄÔT SHOW MYSELF TO HER WITHOUT MONEY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT DID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH PROMISE YOU FROM ME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE DIDN‚ÄÔT EXACTLY PROMISE ANYTHING, BUT ONLY SAID THAT I MIGHT BE OF USE TO YOUR HONOUR IF MY LUCK TURNS OUT GOOD, BUT HOW EXACTLY HE DIDN‚ÄÔT EXPLAIN; FOR PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WANTS TO SEE IF I HAVE THE PATIENCE OF A COSSACK, AND FEELS NO SORT OF CONFIDENCE IN ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPYOTR STEPANOVITCH IS AN ASTRONOMER, AND HAS LEARNT ALL GOD‚ÄÔS PLANETS, BUT EVEN HE MAY BE CRITICISED. I STAND BEFORE YOU, SIR, AS BEFORE GOD, BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOU. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH IS ONE THING, BUT YOU, SIR, MAYBE, ARE SOMETHING ELSE. WHEN HE‚ÄÔS SAID OF A MAN HE‚ÄÔS A SCOUNDREL, HE KNOWS NOTHING MORE ABOUT HIM EXCEPT THAT HE‚ÄÔS A SCOUNDREL. OR IF HE‚ÄÔS SAID HE‚ÄÔS A FOOL, THEN THAT MAN HAS NO CALLING WITH HIM EXCEPT THAT OF FOOL. BUT I MAY BE A FOOL TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY, AND ON THURSDAY WISER THAN HE. HERE NOW HE KNOWS ABOUT ME THAT I‚ÄÔM AWFULLY SICK TO GET A PASSPORT, FOR THERE‚ÄÔS NO GETTING ON IN RUSSIA WITHOUT PAPERS‚ÄÎSO HE THINKS THAT HE‚ÄÔS SNARED MY SOUL. I TELL YOU, SIR, LIFE‚ÄÔS A VERY EASY BUSINESS FOR PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, FOR HE FANCIES A MAN TO BE THIS AND THAT, AND GOES ON AS THOUGH HE REALLY WAS. AND, WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, HE‚ÄÔS BEASTLY STINGY. IT‚ÄÔS HIS NOTION THAT, APART FROM HIM, I DAREN‚ÄÔT TROUBLE YOU, BUT I STAND BEFORE YOU, SIR, AS BEFORE GOD. THIS IS THE FOURTH NIGHT I‚ÄÔVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOUR HONOUR ON THIS BRIDGE, TO SHOW THAT I CAN FIND MY OWN WAY ON THE QUIET, WITHOUT HIM. I‚ÄÔD BETTER BOW TO A BOOT, THINKS I, THAN TO A PEASANT‚ÄÔS SHOE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND WHO TOLD YOU THAT I WAS GOING TO CROSS THE BRIDGE AT NIGHT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, THAT, I‚ÄÔLL OWN, CAME OUT BY CHANCE, MOST THROUGH CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS FOOLISHNESS, BECAUSE HE CAN‚ÄÔT KEEP ANYTHING TO HIMSELF.‚Ä¶ SO THAT THREE ROUBLES FROM YOUR HONOUR WOULD PAY ME FOR THE WEARY TIME I‚ÄÔVE HAD THESE THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS. AND THE CLOTHES I‚ÄÔVE HAD SOAKED, I FEEL THAT TOO MUCH TO SPEAK OF IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM GOING TO THE LEFT; YOU‚ÄÔLL GO TO THE RIGHT. HERE‚ÄÔS THE END OF THE BRIDGE. LISTEN, FYODOR; I LIKE PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I SAY, ONCE FOR ALL. I WON‚ÄÔT GIVE YOU A FARTHING. DON‚ÄÔT MEET ME IN FUTURE ON THE BRIDGE OR ANYWHERE. I‚ÄÔVE NO NEED OF YOU, AND NEVER SHALL HAVE, AND IF YOU DON‚ÄÔT OBEY, I‚ÄÔLL TIE YOU AND TAKE YOU TO THE POLICE. MARCH!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEH-HEH! FLING ME SOMETHING FOR MY COMPANY, ANYHOW. I‚ÄÔVE CHEERED YOU ON YOUR WAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBE OFF!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT DO YOU KNOW THE WAY HERE? THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF TURNINGS.‚Ä¶ I COULD GUIDE YOU; FOR THIS TOWN IS FOR ALL THE WORLD AS THOUGH THE DEVIL CARRIED IT IN HIS BASKET AND DROPPED IT IN BITS HERE AND THERE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL TIE YOU UP!‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, TURNING UPON HIM MENACINGLY.

‚ÄÚPERHAPS YOU‚ÄÔLL CHANGE YOUR MIND, SIR; IT‚ÄÔS EASY TO ILL-TREAT THE HELPLESS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, I SEE YOU CAN RELY ON YOURSELF!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI RELY UPON YOU, SIR, AND NOT VERY MUCH ON MYSELF.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE NO NEED OF YOU AT ALL. I‚ÄÔVE TOLD YOU SO ALREADY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT I HAVE NEED, THAT‚ÄÔS HOW IT IS! I SHALL WAIT FOR YOU ON THE WAY BACK. THERE‚ÄÔS NOTHING FOR IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI GIVE YOU MY WORD OF HONOUR IF I MEET YOU I‚ÄÔLL TIE YOU UP.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, I‚ÄÔLL GET A BELT READY FOR YOU TO TIE ME WITH. A LUCKY JOURNEY TO YOU, SIR. YOU KEPT THE HELPLESS SNUG UNDER YOUR UMBRELLA. FOR THAT ALONE I‚ÄÔLL BE GRATEFUL TO YOU TO MY DYING DAY.‚ÄÙ HE FELL BEHIND. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WALKED ON TO HIS DESTINATION, FEELING DISTURBED. THIS MAN WHO HAD DROPPED FROM THE SKY WAS ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT HE WAS INDISPENSABLE TO HIM, STAVROGIN, AND WAS IN INSOLENT HASTE TO TELL HIM SO. HE WAS BEING TREATED UNCEREMONIOUSLY ALL ROUND. BUT IT WAS POSSIBLE, TOO, THAT THE TRAMP HAD NOT BEEN ALTOGETHER LYING, AND HAD TRIED TO FORCE HIS SERVICES UPON HIM ON HIS OWN INITIATIVE, WITHOUT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS KNOWLEDGE, AND THAT WOULD BE MORE CURIOUS STILL.

II

THE HOUSE WHICH NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAD REACHED STOOD ALONE IN A DESERTED LANE BETWEEN FENCES, BEYOND WHICH MARKET GARDENS STRETCHED, AT THE VERY END OF THE TOWN. IT WAS A VERY SOLITARY LITTLE WOODEN HOUSE, WHICH WAS ONLY JUST BUILT AND NOT YET WEATHER-BOARDED. IN ONE OF THE LITTLE WINDOWS THE SHUTTERS WERE NOT YET CLOSED, AND THERE WAS A CANDLE STANDING ON THE WINDOW-LEDGE, EVIDENTLY AS A SIGNAL TO THE LATE GUEST WHO WAS EXPECTED THAT NIGHT. THIRTY PACES AWAY STAVROGIN MADE OUT ON THE DOORSTEP THE FIGURE OF A TALL MAN, EVIDENTLY THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE, WHO HAD COME OUT TO STARE IMPATIENTLY UP THE ROAD. HE HEARD HIS VOICE, TOO, IMPATIENT AND, AS IT WERE, TIMID.

‚ÄÚIS THAT YOU? YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES,‚ÄÙ RESPONDED NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, BUT NOT TILL HE HAD MOUNTED THE STEPS AND WAS FOLDING UP HIS UMBRELLA.

‚ÄÚAT LAST, SIR.‚ÄÙ CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN, FOR IT WAS HE, RAN FUSSILY TO AND FRO. ‚ÄÚLET ME TAKE YOUR UMBRELLA, PLEASE. IT‚ÄÔS VERY WET; I‚ÄÔLL OPEN IT ON THE FLOOR HERE, IN THE CORNER. PLEASE WALK IN. PLEASE WALK IN.‚ÄÙ

THE DOOR WAS OPEN FROM THE PASSAGE INTO A ROOM THAT WAS LIGHTED BY TWO CANDLES.

‚ÄÚIF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR YOUR PROMISE THAT YOU WOULD CERTAINLY COME, I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN UP EXPECTING YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚA QUARTER TO ONE,‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, LOOKING AT HIS WATCH, AS HE WENT INTO THE ROOM.

‚ÄÚAND IN THIS RAIN; AND SUCH AN INTERESTING DISTANCE. I‚ÄÔVE NO CLOCK ‚Ä¶ AND THERE ARE NOTHING BUT MARKET-GARDENS ROUND ME ‚Ä¶ SO THAT YOU FALL BEHIND THE TIMES. NOT THAT I MURMUR EXACTLY; FOR I DARE NOT, I DARE NOT, BUT ONLY BECAUSE I‚ÄÔVE BEEN DEVOURED WITH IMPATIENCE ALL THE WEEK ‚Ä¶ TO HAVE THINGS SETTLED AT LAST.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW SO?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO HEAR MY FATE, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH. PLEASE SIT DOWN.‚ÄÙ

HE BOWED, POINTING TO A SEAT BY THE TABLE, BEFORE THE SOFA.

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH LOOKED ROUND. THE ROOM WAS TINY AND LOW-PITCHED. THE FURNITURE CONSISTED ONLY OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL ARTICLES, PLAIN WOODEN CHAIRS AND A SOFA, ALSO NEWLY MADE WITHOUT COVERING OR CUSHIONS. THERE WERE TWO TABLES OF LIMEWOOD; ONE BY THE SOFA, AND THE OTHER IN THE CORNER WAS COVERED WITH A TABLE-CLOTH, LAID WITH THINGS OVER WHICH A CLEAN TABLE-NAPKIN HAD BEEN THROWN. AND, INDEED, THE WHOLE ROOM WAS OBVIOUSLY KEPT EXTREMELY CLEAN.

CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN HAD NOT BEEN DRUNK FOR EIGHT DAYS. HIS FACE LOOKED BLOATED AND YELLOW. HIS EYES LOOKED UNEASY, INQUISITIVE, AND OBVIOUSLY BEWILDERED. IT WAS ONLY TOO EVIDENT THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TONE HE COULD ADOPT, AND WHAT LINE IT WOULD BE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS FOR HIM TO TAKE.

‚ÄÚHERE,‚ÄÙ HE INDICATED HIS SURROUNDINGS, ‚ÄÚI LIVE LIKE ZOSSIMA. SOBRIETY, SOLITUDE, AND POVERTY‚ÄÎTHE VOW OF THE KNIGHTS OF OLD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU IMAGINE THAT THE KNIGHTS OF OLD TOOK SUCH VOWS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPERHAPS I‚ÄÔM MISTAKEN. ALAS! I HAVE NO CULTURE. I‚ÄÔVE RUINED ALL. BELIEVE ME, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, HERE FIRST I HAVE RECOVERED FROM SHAMEFUL PROPENSITIES‚ÄÎNOT A GLASS NOR A DROP! I HAVE A HOME, AND FOR SIX DAYS PAST I HAVE EXPERIENCED A CONSCIENCE AT EASE. EVEN THE WALLS SMELL OF RESIN AND REMIND ME OF NATURE. AND WHAT HAVE I BEEN; WHAT WAS I?

     ‚ÄÒAT NIGHT WITHOUT A BED I WANDER
     AND MY TONGUE PUT OUT BY DAY ‚Ä¶‚ÄÔ
TO USE THE WORDS OF A POET OF GENIUS. BUT YOU‚ÄÔRE WET THROUGH.‚Ä¶ WOULDN‚ÄÔT YOU LIKE SOME TEA?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT TROUBLE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE SAMOVAR HAS BEEN BOILING SINCE EIGHT O‚ÄÔCLOCK, BUT IT WENT OUT AT LAST LIKE EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD. THE SUN, TOO, THEY SAY, WILL GO OUT IN ITS TURN. BUT IF YOU LIKE I‚ÄÔLL GET UP THE SAMOVAR. AGAFYA IS NOT ASLEEP.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTELL ME, MARYA TIMOFYEVNA ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSHE‚ÄÔS HERE, HERE,‚ÄÙ LEBYADKIN REPLIED AT ONCE, IN A WHISPER. ‚ÄÚWOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A LOOK AT HER?‚ÄÙ HE POINTED TO THE CLOSED DOOR TO THE NEXT ROOM.

‚ÄÚSHE‚ÄÔS NOT ASLEEP?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, NO, NO. HOW COULD SHE BE? ON THE CONTRARY, SHE‚ÄÔS BEEN EXPECTING YOU ALL THE EVENING, AND AS SOON AS SHE HEARD YOU WERE COMING SHE BEGAN MAKING HER TOILET.‚ÄÙ

HE WAS JUST TWISTING HIS MOUTH INTO A JOCOSE SMILE, BUT HE INSTANTLY CHECKED HIMSELF.

‚ÄÚHOW IS SHE, ON THE WHOLE?‚ÄÙ ASKED NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, FROWNING.

‚ÄÚON THE WHOLE? YOU KNOW THAT YOURSELF, SIR.‚ÄÙ HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS COMMISERATINGLY. ‚ÄÚBUT JUST NOW ‚Ä¶ JUST NOW SHE‚ÄÔS TELLING HER FORTUNE WITH CARDS.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚVERY GOOD. LATER ON. FIRST OF ALL I MUST FINISH WITH YOU.‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SETTLED HIMSELF IN A CHAIR. THE CAPTAIN DID NOT VENTURE TO SIT DOWN ON THE SOFA, BUT AT ONCE MOVED UP ANOTHER CHAIR FOR HIMSELF, AND BENT FORWARD TO LISTEN, IN A TREMOR OF EXPECTATION.

‚ÄÚWHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE UNDER THE TABLE-CLOTH?‚ÄÙ ASKED NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, SUDDENLY NOTICING IT.

‚ÄÚTHAT?‚ÄÙ SAID LEBYADKIN, TURNING TOWARDS IT ALSO. ‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS FROM YOUR GENEROSITY, BY WAY OF HOUSE-WARMING, SO TO SAY; CONSIDERING ALSO THE LENGTH OF THE WALK, AND YOUR NATURAL FATIGUE,‚ÄÙ HE SNIGGERED INGRATIATINGLY. THEN HE GOT UP ON TIPTOE, AND RESPECTFULLY AND CAREFULLY LIFTED THE TABLE-CLOTH FROM THE TABLE IN THE CORNER. UNDER IT WAS SEEN A SLIGHT MEAL: HAM, VEAL, SARDINES, CHEESE, A LITTLE GREEN DECANTER, AND A LONG BOTTLE OF BORDEAUX. EVERYTHING HAD BEEN LAID NEATLY, EXPERTLY, AND ALMOST DAINTILY.

‚ÄÚWAS THAT YOUR EFFORT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, SIR. EVER SINCE YESTERDAY I‚ÄÔVE DONE MY BEST, AND ALL TO DO YOU HONOUR.‚Ä¶ MARYA TIMOFYEVNA DOESN‚ÄÔT TROUBLE HERSELF, AS YOU KNOW, ON THAT SCORE. AND WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE ITS ALL FROM YOUR LIBERALITY, YOUR OWN PROVIDING, AS YOU‚ÄÔRE THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE AND NOT I, AND I‚ÄÔM ONLY, SO TO SAY, YOUR AGENT. ALL THE SAME, ALL THE SAME, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, ALL THE SAME, IN SPIRIT, I‚ÄÔM INDEPENDENT! DON‚ÄÔT TAKE AWAY FROM ME THIS LAST POSSESSION!‚ÄÙ HE FINISHED UP PATHETICALLY.

‚ÄÚH‚ÄÔM! YOU MIGHT SIT DOWN AGAIN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGRA-A-TEFUL, GRATEFUL, AND INDEPENDENT.‚ÄÙ HE SAT DOWN. ‚ÄÚAH, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, SO MUCH HAS BEEN FERMENTING IN THIS HEART THAT I HAVE NOT KNOWN HOW TO WAIT FOR YOUR COMING. NOW YOU WILL DECIDE MY FATE, AND ‚Ä¶ THAT UNHAPPY CREATURE‚ÄÔS, AND THEN ‚Ä¶ SHALL I POUR OUT ALL I FEEL TO YOU AS I USED TO IN OLD DAYS, FOUR YEARS AGO? YOU DEIGNED TO LISTEN TO ME THEN, YOU READ MY VERSES.‚Ä¶ THEY MIGHT CALL ME YOUR FALSTAFF FROM SHAKESPEARE IN THOSE DAYS, BUT YOU MEANT SO MUCH IN MY LIFE! I HAVE GREAT TERRORS NOW, AND IT‚ÄÔS ONLY TO YOU I LOOK FOR COUNSEL AND LIGHT. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH IS TREATING ME ABOMINABLY!‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH LISTENED WITH INTEREST, AND LOOKED AT HIM ATTENTIVELY. IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THOUGH CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN HAD LEFT OFF DRINKING HE WAS FAR FROM BEING IN A HARMONIOUS STATE OF MIND. DRUNKARDS OF MANY YEARS‚ÄÔ STANDING, LIKE LEBYADKIN, OFTEN SHOW TRACES OF INCOHERENCE, OF MENTAL CLOUDINESS, OF SOMETHING, AS IT WERE, DAMAGED, AND CRAZY, THOUGH THEY MAY DECEIVE, CHEAT, AND SWINDLE, ALMOST AS WELL AS ANYBODY IF OCCASION ARISES.

‚ÄÚI SEE THAT YOU HAVEN‚ÄÔT CHANGED A BIT IN THESE FOUR YEARS AND MORE, CAPTAIN,‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, SOMEWHAT MORE AMIABLY. ‚ÄÚIT SEEMS, IN FACT, AS THOUGH THE SECOND HALF OF A MAN‚ÄÔS LIFE IS USUALLY MADE UP OF NOTHING BUT THE HABITS HE HAS ACCUMULATED DURING THE FIRST HALF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGRAND WORDS! YOU SOLVE THE RIDDLE OF LIFE!‚ÄÙ SAID THE CAPTAIN, HALF CUNNINGLY, HALF IN GENUINE AND UNFEIGNED ADMIRATION, FOR HE WAS A GREAT LOVER OF WORDS. ‚ÄÚOF ALL YOUR SAYINGS, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, I REMEMBER ONE THING ABOVE ALL; YOU WERE IN PETERSBURG WHEN YOU SAID IT: ‚ÄÒONE MUST REALLY BE A GREAT MAN TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A STAND EVEN AGAINST COMMON SENSE.‚ÄÔ THAT WAS IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, AND A FOOL AS WELL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚA FOOL AS WELL, MAYBE. BUT YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN SCATTERING CLEVER SAYINGS ALL YOUR LIFE, WHILE THEY.‚Ä¶ IMAGINE LIPUTIN, IMAGINE PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SAYING ANYTHING LIKE THAT! OH, HOW CRUELLY PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAS TREATED ME!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT HOW ABOUT YOURSELF, CAPTAIN? WHAT CAN YOU SAY OF YOUR BEHAVIOUR?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDRUNKENNESS, AND THE MULTITUDE OF MY ENEMIES. BUT NOW THAT‚ÄÔS ALL OVER, ALL OVER, AND I HAVE A NEW SKIN, LIKE A SNAKE. DO YOU KNOW, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, I AM MAKING MY WILL; IN FACT, I‚ÄÔVE MADE IT ALREADY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS INTERESTING. WHAT ARE YOU LEAVING, AND TO WHOM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO MY FATHERLAND, TO HUMANITY, AND TO THE STUDENTS. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, I READ IN THE PAPER THE BIOGRAPHY OF AN AMERICAN. HE LEFT ALL HIS VAST FORTUNE TO FACTORIES AND TO THE EXACT SCIENCES, AND HIS SKELETON TO THE STUDENTS OF THE ACADEMY THERE, AND HIS SKIN TO BE MADE INTO A DRUM, SO THAT THE AMERICAN NATIONAL HYMN MIGHT BE BEATEN UPON IT DAY AND NIGHT. ALAS! WE ARE PIGMIES IN MIND COMPARED WITH THE SOARING THOUGHT OF THE STATES OF NORTH AMERICA. RUSSIA IS THE PLAY OF NATURE BUT NOT OF MIND. IF I WERE TO TRY LEAVING MY SKIN FOR A DRUM, FOR INSTANCE, TO THE AKMOLINSKY INFANTRY REGIMENT, IN WHICH I HAD THE HONOUR OF BEGINNING MY SERVICE, ON CONDITION OF BEATING THE RUSSIAN NATIONAL HYMN UPON IT EVERY DAY, IN FACE OF THE REGIMENT, THEY‚ÄÔD TAKE IT FOR LIBERALISM AND PROHIBIT MY SKIN ‚Ä¶ AND SO I CONFINE MYSELF TO THE STUDENTS. I WANT TO LEAVE MY SKELETON TO THE ACADEMY, BUT ON THE CONDITION THOUGH, ON THE CONDITION THAT A LABEL SHOULD BE STUCK ON THE FOREHEAD FOREVER AND EVER, WITH THE WORDS: ‚ÄÒA REPENTANT FREE-THINKER.‚ÄÔ THERE NOW!‚ÄÙ

THE CAPTAIN SPOKE EXCITEDLY, AND GENUINELY BELIEVED, OF COURSE, THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING FINE IN THE AMERICAN WILL, BUT HE WAS CUNNING TOO, AND VERY ANXIOUS TO ENTERTAIN NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, WITH WHOM HE HAD PLAYED THE PART OF A BUFFOON FOR A LONG TIME IN THE PAST. BUT THE LATTER DID NOT EVEN SMILE, ON THE CONTRARY, HE ASKED, AS IT WERE, SUSPICIOUSLY:

‚ÄÚSO YOU INTEND TO PUBLISH YOUR WILL IN YOUR LIFETIME AND GET REWARDED FOR IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND WHAT IF I DO, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH? WHAT IF I DO?‚ÄÙ SAID LEBYADKIN, WATCHING HIM CAREFULLY. ‚ÄÚWHAT SORT OF LUCK HAVE I HAD? I‚ÄÔVE GIVEN UP WRITING POETRY, AND AT ONE TIME EVEN YOU WERE AMUSED BY MY VERSES, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH. DO YOU REMEMBER OUR READING THEM OVER A BOTTLE? BUT IT‚ÄÔS ALL OVER WITH MY PEN. I‚ÄÔVE WRITTEN ONLY ONE POEM, LIKE GOGOL‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÒTHE LAST STORY.‚ÄÔ DO YOU REMEMBER HE PROCLAIMED TO RUSSIA THAT IT BROKE SPONTANEOUSLY FROM HIS BOSOM? IT‚ÄÔS THE SAME WITH ME; I‚ÄÔVE SUNG MY LAST AND IT‚ÄÔS OVER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT SORT OF POEM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒIN CASE SHE WERE TO BREAK HER LEG.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHA-A-T?‚ÄÙ

THAT WAS ALL THE CAPTAIN WAS WAITING FOR. HE HAD AN UNBOUNDED ADMIRATION FOR HIS OWN POEMS, BUT, THROUGH A CERTAIN CUNNING DUPLICITY, HE WAS PLEASED, TOO, THAT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH ALWAYS MADE MERRY OVER HIS POEMS, AND SOMETIMES LAUGHED AT THEM IMMODERATELY. IN THIS WAY HE KILLED TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE, SATISFYING AT ONCE HIS POETICAL ASPIRATIONS AND HIS DESIRE TO BE OF SERVICE; BUT NOW HE HAD A THIRD SPECIAL AND VERY TICKLISH OBJECT IN VIEW. BRINGING HIS VERSES ON THE SCENE, THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT TO EXCULPATE HIMSELF ON ONE POINT ABOUT WHICH, FOR SOME REASON, HE ALWAYS FELT HIMSELF MOST APPREHENSIVE, AND MOST GUILTY.

‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒIN CASE OF HER BREAKING HER LEG.‚ÄÔ THAT IS, OF HER RIDING ON HORSEBACK. IT‚ÄÔS A FANTASY, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, A WILD FANCY, BUT THE FANCY OF A POET. ONE DAY I WAS STRUCK BY MEETING A LADY ON HORSEBACK, AND ASKED MYSELF THE VITAL QUESTION, ‚ÄÒWHAT WOULD HAPPEN THEN?‚ÄÔ THAT IS, IN CASE OF ACCIDENT. ALL HER FOLLOWERS TURN AWAY, ALL HER SUITORS ARE GONE. A PRETTY KETTLE OF FISH. ONLY THE POET REMAINS FAITHFUL, WITH HIS HEART SHATTERED IN HIS BREAST, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH. EVEN A LOUSE MAY BE IN LOVE, AND IS NOT FORBIDDEN BY LAW. AND YET THE LADY WAS OFFENDED BY THE LETTER AND THE VERSES. I‚ÄÔM TOLD THAT EVEN YOU WERE ANGRY. WERE YOU? I WOULDN‚ÄÔT BELIEVE IN ANYTHING SO GRIEVOUS. WHOM COULD I HARM SIMPLY BY IMAGINATION? BESIDES, I SWEAR ON MY HONOUR, LIPUTIN KEPT SAYING, ‚ÄÒSEND IT, SEND IT,‚ÄÔ EVERY MAN, HOWEVER HUMBLE, HAS A RIGHT TO SEND A LETTER! AND SO I SENT IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU OFFERED YOURSELF AS A SUITOR, I UNDERSTAND.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚENEMIES, ENEMIES, ENEMIES!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚREPEAT THE VERSES,‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH STERNLY.

‚ÄÚRAVINGS, RAVINGS, MORE THAN ANYTHING.‚ÄÙ

HOWEVER, HE DREW HIMSELF UP, STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND, AND BEGAN:

     ‚ÄÚWITH BROKEN LIMBS MY BEAUTEOUS QUEEN
     IS TWICE AS CHARMING AS BEFORE,
     AND, DEEP IN LOVE AS I HAVE BEEN,
     TO-DAY I LOVE HER EVEN MORE.‚ÄÙ
‚ÄÚCOME, THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH,‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, WITH A WAVE OF HIS HAND.

‚ÄÚI DREAM OF PETERSBURG,‚ÄÙ CRIED LEBYADKIN, PASSING QUICKLY TO ANOTHER SUBJECT, AS THOUGH THERE HAD BEEN NO MENTION OF VERSES. ‚ÄÚI DREAM OF REGENERATION.‚Ä¶ BENEFACTOR! MAY I RECKON THAT YOU WON‚ÄÔT REFUSE THE MEANS FOR THE JOURNEY? I‚ÄÔVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU ALL THE WEEK AS MY SUNSHINE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL DO NOTHING OF THE SORT. I‚ÄÔVE SCARCELY ANY MONEY LEFT. AND WHY SHOULD I GIVE YOU MONEY?‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SEEMED SUDDENLY ANGRY. DRYLY AND BRIEFLY HE RECAPITULATED ALL THE CAPTAIN‚ÄÔS MISDEEDS; HIS DRUNKENNESS, HIS LYING, HIS SQUANDERING OF THE MONEY MEANT FOR MARYA TIMOFYEVNA, HIS HAVING TAKEN HER FROM THE NUNNERY, HIS INSOLENT LETTERS THREATENING TO PUBLISH THE SECRET, THE WAY HE HAD BEHAVED ABOUT DARYA PAVLOVNA, AND SO ON, AND SO ON. THE CAPTAIN HEAVED, GESTICULATED, BEGAN TO REPLY, BUT EVERY TIME NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH STOPPED HIM PEREMPTORILY.

‚ÄÚAND LISTEN,‚ÄÙ HE OBSERVED AT LAST, ‚ÄÚYOU KEEP WRITING ABOUT ‚ÄÒFAMILY DISGRACE.‚ÄÔ WHAT DISGRACE IS IT TO YOU THAT YOUR SISTER IS THE LAWFUL WIFE OF A STAVROGIN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT MARRIAGE IN SECRET, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH‚ÄÎA FATAL SECRET. I RECEIVE MONEY FROM YOU, AND I‚ÄÔM SUDDENLY ASKED THE QUESTION, ‚ÄÒWHAT‚ÄÔS THAT MONEY FOR?‚ÄÔ MY HANDS ARE TIED; I CANNOT ANSWER TO THE DETRIMENT OF MY SISTER, TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE FAMILY HONOUR.‚ÄÙ

THE CAPTAIN RAISED HIS VOICE. HE LIKED THAT SUBJECT AND RECKONED BOLDLY UPON IT. ALAS! HE DID NOT REALISE WHAT A BLOW WAS IN STORE FOR HIM.

CALMLY AND EXACTLY, AS THOUGH HE WERE SPEAKING OF THE MOST EVERYDAY ARRANGEMENT, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH INFORMED HIM THAT IN A FEW DAYS, PERHAPS EVEN TO-MORROW OR THE DAY AFTER, HE INTENDED TO MAKE HIS MARRIAGE KNOWN EVERYWHERE, ‚ÄÚTO THE POLICE AS WELL AS TO LOCAL SOCIETY.‚ÄÙ AND SO THE QUESTION OF FAMILY HONOUR WOULD BE SETTLED ONCE FOR ALL, AND WITH IT THE QUESTION OF SUBSIDY. THE CAPTAIN‚ÄÔS EYES WERE READY TO DROP OUT OF HIS HEAD; HE POSITIVELY COULD NOT TAKE IT IN. IT HAD TO BE EXPLAINED TO HIM.

‚ÄÚBUT SHE IS ‚Ä¶ CRAZY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SHALL MAKE SUITABLE ARRANGEMENTS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT ‚Ä¶ HOW ABOUT YOUR MOTHER?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, SHE MUST DO AS SHE LIKES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT WILL YOU TAKE YOUR WIFE TO YOUR HOUSE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPERHAPS SO. BUT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU AND NO CONCERN OF YOURS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO CONCERN OF MINE!‚ÄÙ CRIED THE CAPTAIN. ‚ÄÚWHAT ABOUT ME THEN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, CERTAINLY YOU WON‚ÄÔT COME INTO MY HOUSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT, YOU KNOW, I‚ÄÔM A RELATION.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚONE DOES ONE‚ÄÔS BEST TO ESCAPE FROM SUCH RELATIONS. WHY SHOULD I GO ON GIVING YOU MONEY THEN? JUDGE FOR YOURSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE. YOU WILL THINK BETTER OF IT, PERHAPS? YOU DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO LAY HANDS UPON.‚Ä¶ WHAT WILL PEOPLE THINK? WHAT WILL THE WORLD SAY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMUCH I CARE FOR YOUR WORLD. I MARRIED YOUR SISTER WHEN THE FANCY TOOK ME, AFTER A DRUNKEN DINNER, FOR A BET, AND NOW I‚ÄÔLL MAKE IT PUBLIC ‚Ä¶ SINCE THAT AMUSES ME NOW.‚ÄÙ

HE SAID THIS WITH A PECULIAR IRRITABILITY, SO THAT LEBYADKIN BEGAN WITH HORROR TO BELIEVE HIM.

‚ÄÚBUT ME, ME? WHAT ABOUT ME? I‚ÄÔM WHAT MATTERS MOST!‚Ä¶ PERHAPS YOU‚ÄÔRE JOKING, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, I‚ÄÔM NOT JOKING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAS YOU WILL, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, BUT I DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE YOU.‚Ä¶ THEN I‚ÄÔLL TAKE PROCEEDINGS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE FEARFULLY STUPID, CAPTAIN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMAYBE, BUT THIS IS ALL THAT‚ÄÔS LEFT ME,‚ÄÙ SAID THE CAPTAIN, LOSING HIS HEAD COMPLETELY. ‚ÄÚIN OLD DAYS WE USED TO GET FREE QUARTERS, ANYWAY, FOR THE WORK SHE DID IN THE ‚ÄÒCORNERS.‚ÄÔ BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW IF YOU THROW ME OVER ALTOGETHER?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT YOU WANT TO GO TO PETERSBURG TO TRY A NEW CAREER. BY THE WAY, IS IT TRUE WHAT I HEAR, THAT YOU MEAN TO GO AND GIVE INFORMATION, IN THE HOPE OF OBTAINING A PARDON, BY BETRAYING ALL THE OTHERS?‚ÄÙ

THE CAPTAIN STOOD GAPING WITH WIDE-OPEN EYES, AND MADE NO ANSWER.

‚ÄÚLISTEN, CAPTAIN,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN BEGAN SUDDENLY, WITH GREAT EARNESTNESS, BENDING DOWN TO THE TABLE. UNTIL THEN HE HAD BEEN TALKING, AS IT WERE, AMBIGUOUSLY, SO THAT LEBYADKIN, WHO HAD WIDE EXPERIENCE IN PLAYING THE PART OF BUFFOON, WAS UP TO THE LAST MOMENT A TRIFLE UNCERTAIN WHETHER HIS PATRON WERE REALLY ANGRY OR SIMPLY PUTTING IT ON; WHETHER HE REALLY HAD THE WILD INTENTION OF MAKING HIS MARRIAGE PUBLIC, OR WHETHER HE WERE ONLY PLAYING. NOW NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH‚ÄÔS STERN EXPRESSION WAS SO CONVINCING THAT A SHIVER RAN DOWN THE CAPTAIN‚ÄÔS BACK.

‚ÄÚLISTEN, AND TELL THE TRUTH, LEBYADKIN. HAVE YOU BETRAYED ANYTHING YET, OR NOT? HAVE YOU SUCCEEDED IN DOING ANYTHING REALLY? HAVE YOU SENT A LETTER TO SOMEBODY IN YOUR FOOLISHNESS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, I HAVEN‚ÄÔT ‚Ä¶ AND I HAVEN‚ÄÔT THOUGHT OF DOING IT,‚ÄÙ SAID THE CAPTAIN, LOOKING FIXEDLY AT HIM.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS A LIE, THAT YOU HAVEN‚ÄÔT THOUGHT OF DOING IT. THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT YOU‚ÄÔRE ASKING TO GO TO PETERSBURG FOR. IF YOU HAVEN‚ÄÔT WRITTEN, HAVE YOU BLABBED TO ANYBODY HERE? SPEAK THE TRUTH. I‚ÄÔVE HEARD SOMETHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHEN I WAS DRUNK, TO LIPUTIN. LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS A TRAITOR. I OPENED MY HEART TO HIM,‚ÄÙ WHISPERED THE POOR CAPTAIN.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS ALL VERY WELL, BUT THERE‚ÄÔS NO NEED TO BE AN ASS. IF YOU HAD AN IDEA YOU SHOULD HAVE KEPT IT TO YOURSELF. SENSIBLE PEOPLE HOLD THEIR TONGUES NOWADAYS; THEY DON‚ÄÔT GO CHATTERING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH!‚ÄÙ SAID THE CAPTAIN, QUAKING. ‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT YOURSELF; IT‚ÄÔS NOT YOU I‚ÄÔVE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES. YOU WOULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE VENTURED TO KILL THE GOOSE THAT LAID YOUR GOLDEN EGGS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚJUDGE FOR YOURSELF, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, JUDGE FOR YOURSELF,‚ÄÙ AND, IN DESPAIR, WITH TEARS, THE CAPTAIN BEGAN HURRIEDLY RELATING THE STORY OF HIS LIFE FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS. IT WAS THE MOST STUPID STORY OF A FOOL, DRAWN INTO MATTERS THAT DID NOT CONCERN HIM, AND IN HIS DRUNKENNESS AND DEBAUCHERY UNABLE, TILL THE LAST MINUTE, TO GRASP THEIR IMPORTANCE. HE SAID THAT BEFORE HE LEFT PETERSBURG ‚ÄÒHE HAD BEEN DRAWN IN, AT FIRST SIMPLY THROUGH FRIENDSHIP, LIKE A REGULAR STUDENT, ALTHOUGH HE WASN‚ÄÔT A STUDENT,‚ÄÔ AND KNOWING NOTHING ABOUT IT, ‚ÄÒWITHOUT BEING GUILTY OF ANYTHING,‚ÄÔ HE HAD SCATTERED VARIOUS PAPERS ON STAIRCASES, LEFT THEM BY DOZENS AT DOORS, ON BELL-HANDLES, HAD THRUST THEM IN AS THOUGH THEY WERE NEWSPAPERS, TAKEN THEM TO THE THEATRE, PUT THEM IN PEOPLE‚ÄÔS HATS, AND SLIPPED THEM INTO POCKETS. AFTERWARDS HE HAD TAKEN MONEY FROM THEM, ‚ÄÒFOR WHAT MEANS HAD I?‚ÄÔ HE HAD DISTRIBUTED ALL SORTS OF RUBBISH THROUGH THE DISTRICTS OF TWO PROVINCES. ‚ÄÚOH, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH!‚ÄÙ HE EXCLAIMED, ‚ÄÚWHAT REVOLTED ME MOST WAS THAT THIS WAS UTTERLY OPPOSED TO CIVIC, AND STILL MORE TO PATRIOTIC LAWS. THEY SUDDENLY PRINTED THAT MEN WERE TO GO OUT WITH PITCHFORKS, AND TO REMEMBER THAT THOSE WHO WENT OUT POOR IN THE MORNING MIGHT GO HOME RICH AT NIGHT. ONLY THINK OF IT! IT MADE ME SHUDDER, AND YET I DISTRIBUTED IT. OR SUDDENLY FIVE OR SIX LINES ADDRESSED TO THE WHOLE OF RUSSIA, APROPOS OF NOTHING, ‚ÄÒMAKE HASTE AND LOCK UP THE CHURCHES, ABOLISH GOD, DO AWAY WITH MARRIAGE, DESTROY THE RIGHT OF INHERITANCE, TAKE UP YOUR KNIVES,‚ÄÔ THAT‚ÄÔS ALL, AND GOD KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS. I TELL YOU, I ALMOST GOT CAUGHT WITH THIS FIVE-LINE LEAFLET. THE OFFICERS IN THE REGIMENT GAVE ME A THRASHING, BUT, BLESS THEM FOR IT, LET ME GO. AND LAST YEAR I WAS ALMOST CAUGHT WHEN I PASSED OFF FRENCH COUNTERFEIT NOTES FOR FIFTY ROUBLES ON KOROVAYEV, BUT, THANK GOD, KOROVAYEV FELL INTO THE POND WHEN HE WAS DRUNK, AND WAS DROWNED IN THE NICK OF TIME, AND THEY DIDN‚ÄÔT SUCCEED IN TRACKING ME. HERE, AT VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS, I PROCLAIMED THE FREEDOM OF THE COMMUNISTIC LIFE. IN JUNE I WAS DISTRIBUTING MANIFESTOES AGAIN IN X DISTRICT. THEY SAY THEY WILL MAKE ME DO IT AGAIN.‚Ä¶ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SUDDENLY GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT I MUST OBEY; HE‚ÄÔS BEEN THREATENING ME A LONG TIME. HOW HE TREATED ME THAT SUNDAY! NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, I AM A SLAVE, I AM A WORM, BUT NOT A GOD, WHICH IS WHERE I DIFFER FROM DERZHAVIN.* BUT I‚ÄÔVE NO INCOME, NO INCOME!‚ÄÙ

     * THE REFERENCE IS TO A POEM OF DERZHAVIN‚ÄÔS.
NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HEARD IT ALL WITH CURIOSITY.

‚ÄÚA GREAT DEAL OF THAT I HAD HEARD NOTHING OF,‚ÄÙ HE SAID. ‚ÄÚOF COURSE, ANYTHING MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU.‚Ä¶ LISTEN,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, AFTER A MINUTE‚ÄÔS THOUGHT. ‚ÄÚIF YOU LIKE, YOU CAN TELL THEM, YOU KNOW WHOM, THAT LIPUTIN WAS LYING, AND THAT YOU WERE ONLY PRETENDING TO GIVE INFORMATION TO FRIGHTEN ME, SUPPOSING THAT I, TOO, WAS COMPROMISED, AND THAT YOU MIGHT GET MORE MONEY OUT OF ME THAT WAY.‚Ä¶ DO YOU UNDERSTAND?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDEAR NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE‚ÄÔS SUCH A DANGER HANGING OVER ME? I‚ÄÔVE BEEN LONGING FOR YOU TO COME, TO ASK YOU.‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH LAUGHED.

‚ÄÚTHEY CERTAINLY WOULDN‚ÄÔT LET YOU GO TO PETERSBURG, EVEN IF I WERE TO GIVE YOU MONEY FOR THE JOURNEY.‚Ä¶ BUT IT‚ÄÔS TIME FOR ME TO SEE MARYA TIMOFYEVNA.‚ÄÙ AND HE GOT UP FROM HIS CHAIR.

‚ÄÚNIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, BUT HOW ABOUT MARYA TIMOFYEVNA?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, AS I TOLD YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCAN IT BE TRUE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU STILL DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWILL YOU REALLY CAST ME OFF LIKE AN OLD WORN-OUT SHOE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL SEE,‚ÄÙ LAUGHED NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH. ‚ÄÚCOME, LET ME GO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWOULDN‚ÄÔT YOU LIKE ME TO STAND ON THE STEPS ‚Ä¶ FOR FEAR I MIGHT BY CHANCE OVERHEAR SOMETHING ‚Ä¶ FOR THE ROOMS ARE SMALL?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS AS WELL. STAND ON THE STEPS. TAKE MY UMBRELLA.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOUR UMBRELLA.‚Ä¶ AM I WORTH IT?‚ÄÙ SAID THE CAPTAIN OVER-SWEETLY.

‚ÄÚANYONE IS WORTHY OF AN UMBRELLA.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAT ONE STROKE YOU DEFINE THE MINIMUM OF HUMAN RIGHTS.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

BUT HE WAS BY NOW MUTTERING MECHANICALLY. HE WAS TOO MUCH CRUSHED BY WHAT HE HAD LEARNED, AND WAS COMPLETELY THROWN OUT OF HIS RECKONING. AND YET ALMOST AS SOON AS HE HAD GONE OUT ON TO THE STEPS AND HAD PUT UP THE UMBRELLA, THERE HIS SHALLOW AND CUNNING BRAIN CAUGHT AGAIN THE EVER-PRESENT, COMFORTING IDEA THAT HE WAS BEING CHEATED AND DECEIVED, AND IF SO THEY WERE AFRAID OF HIM, AND THERE WAS NO NEED FOR HIM TO BE AFRAID.

‚ÄÚIF THEY‚ÄÔRE LYING AND DECEIVING ME, WHAT‚ÄÔS AT THE BOTTOM OF IT?‚ÄÙ WAS THE THOUGHT THAT GNAWED AT HIS MIND. THE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE MARRIAGE SEEMED TO HIM ABSURD. ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS TRUE THAT WITH SUCH A WONDER-WORKER ANYTHING MAY COME TO PASS; HE LIVES TO DO HARM. BUT WHAT IF HE‚ÄÔS AFRAID HIMSELF, SINCE THE INSULT OF SUNDAY, AND AFRAID AS HE‚ÄÔS NEVER BEEN BEFORE? AND SO HE‚ÄÔS IN A HURRY TO DECLARE THAT HE‚ÄÔLL ANNOUNCE IT HIMSELF, FROM FEAR THAT I SHOULD ANNOUNCE IT. EH, DON‚ÄÔT BLUNDER, LEBYADKIN! AND WHY DOES HE COME ON THE SLY, AT NIGHT, IF HE MEANS TO MAKE IT PUBLIC HIMSELF? AND IF HE‚ÄÔS AFRAID, IT MEANS THAT HE‚ÄÔS AFRAID NOW, AT THIS MOMENT, FOR THESE FEW DAYS.‚Ä¶ EH, DON‚ÄÔT MAKE A MISTAKE, LEBYADKIN!

‚ÄÚHE SCARES ME WITH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. OY, I‚ÄÔM FRIGHTENED, I‚ÄÔM FRIGHTENED! YES, THIS IS WHAT‚ÄÔS SO FRIGHTENING! AND WHAT INDUCED ME TO BLAB TO LIPUTIN. GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT THESE DEVILS ARE UP TO. I NEVER CAN MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF IT. NOW THEY ARE ALL ASTIR AGAIN AS THEY WERE FIVE YEARS AGO. TO WHOM COULD I GIVE INFORMATION, INDEED? ‚ÄÒHAVEN‚ÄÔT I WRITTEN TO ANYONE IN MY FOOLISHNESS?‚ÄÔ H‚ÄÔM! SO THEN I MIGHT WRITE AS THOUGH THROUGH FOOLISHNESS? ISN‚ÄÔT HE GIVING ME A HINT? ‚ÄÒYOU‚ÄÔRE GOING TO PETERSBURG ON PURPOSE.‚ÄÔ THE SLY ROGUE. I‚ÄÔVE SCARCELY DREAMED OF IT, AND HE GUESSES MY DREAMS. AS THOUGH HE WERE PUTTING ME UP TO GOING HIMSELF. IT‚ÄÔS ONE OR THE OTHER OF TWO GAMES HE‚ÄÔS UP TO. EITHER HE‚ÄÔS AFRAID BECAUSE HE‚ÄÔS BEEN UP TO SOME PRANKS HIMSELF ‚Ä¶ OR HE‚ÄÔS NOT AFRAID FOR HIMSELF, BUT IS SIMPLY EGGING ME ON TO GIVE THEM ALL AWAY! ACH, IT‚ÄÔS TERRIBLE, LEBYADKIN! ACH, YOU MUST NOT MAKE A BLUNDER!‚ÄÙ

HE WAS SO ABSORBED IN THOUGHT THAT HE FORGOT TO LISTEN. IT WAS NOT EASY TO HEAR EITHER. THE DOOR WAS A SOLID ONE, AND THEY WERE TALKING IN A VERY LOW VOICE. NOTHING REACHED THE CAPTAIN BUT INDISTINCT SOUNDS. HE POSITIVELY SPAT IN DISGUST, AND WENT OUT AGAIN, LOST IN THOUGHT, TO WHISTLE ON THE STEPS.

III

MARYA TIMOFYEVNA‚ÄÔS ROOM WAS TWICE AS LARGE AS THE ONE OCCUPIED BY THE CAPTAIN, AND FURNISHED IN THE SAME ROUGH STYLE; BUT THE TABLE IN FRONT OF THE SOFA WAS COVERED WITH A GAY-COLOURED TABLE-CLOTH, AND ON IT A LAMP WAS BURNING. THERE WAS A HANDSOME CARPET ON THE FLOOR. THE BED WAS SCREENED OFF BY A GREEN CURTAIN, WHICH RAN THE LENGTH OF THE ROOM, AND BESIDES THE SOFA THERE STOOD BY THE TABLE A LARGE, SOFT EASY CHAIR, IN WHICH MARYA TIMOFYEVNA NEVER SAT, HOWEVER. IN THE CORNER THERE WAS AN IKON AS THERE HAD BEEN IN HER OLD ROOM, AND A LITTLE LAMP WAS BURNING BEFORE IT, AND ON THE TABLE WERE ALL HER INDISPENSABLE PROPERTIES. THE PACK OF CARDS, THE LITTLE LOOKING-GLASS, THE SONG-BOOK, EVEN A MILK LOAF. BESIDES THESE THERE WERE TWO BOOKS WITH COLOURED PICTURES‚ÄÎONE, EXTRACTS FROM A POPULAR BOOK OF TRAVELS, PUBLISHED FOR JUVENILE READING, THE OTHER A COLLECTION OF VERY LIGHT, EDIFYING TALES, FOR THE MOST PART ABOUT THE DAYS OF CHIVALRY, INTENDED FOR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS OR SCHOOL READING. SHE HAD, TOO, AN ALBUM OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF VARIOUS SORTS.

MARYA TIMOFYEVNA WAS, OF COURSE, EXPECTING THE VISITOR, AS THE CAPTAIN HAD ANNOUNCED. BUT WHEN NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WENT IN, SHE WAS ASLEEP, HALF RECLINING ON THE SOFA, PROPPED ON A WOOLWORK CUSHION. HER VISITOR CLOSED THE DOOR AFTER HIM NOISELESSLY, AND, STANDING STILL, SCRUTINISED THE SLEEPING FIGURE.

THE CAPTAIN HAD BEEN ROMANCING WHEN HE TOLD NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SHE HAD BEEN DRESSING HERSELF UP. SHE WAS WEARING THE SAME DARK DRESS AS ON SUNDAY AT VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS. HER HAIR WAS DONE UP IN THE SAME LITTLE CLOSE KNOT AT THE BACK OF HER HEAD; HER LONG THIN NECK WAS EXPOSED IN THE SAME WAY. THE BLACK SHAWL VARVARA PETROVNA HAD GIVEN HER LAY CAREFULLY FOLDED ON THE SOFA. SHE WAS COARSELY ROUGED AND POWDERED AS BEFORE. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH DID NOT STAND THERE MORE THAN A MINUTE. SHE SUDDENLY WAKED UP, AS THOUGH SHE WERE CONSCIOUS OF HIS EYES FIXED UPON HER; SHE OPENED HER EYES, AND QUICKLY DREW HERSELF UP. BUT SOMETHING STRANGE MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO HER VISITOR: HE REMAINED STANDING AT THE SAME PLACE BY THE DOOR. WITH A FIXED AND SEARCHING GLANCE HE LOOKED MUTELY AND PERSISTENTLY INTO HER FACE. PERHAPS THAT LOOK WAS TOO GRIM, PERHAPS THERE WAS AN EXPRESSION OF AVERSION IN IT, EVEN A MALIGNANT ENJOYMENT OF HER FRIGHT‚ÄÎIF IT WERE NOT A FANCY LEFT BY HER DREAMS; BUT SUDDENLY, AFTER ALMOST A MOMENT OF EXPECTATION, THE POOR WOMAN‚ÄÔS FACE WORE A LOOK OF ABSOLUTE TERROR; IT TWITCHED CONVULSIVELY; SHE LIFTED HER TREMBLING HANDS AND SUDDENLY BURST INTO TEARS, EXACTLY LIKE A FRIGHTENED CHILD; IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WOULD HAVE SCREAMED. BUT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER; HIS FACE CHANGED IN ONE INSTANT, AND HE WENT UP TO THE TABLE WITH THE MOST CORDIAL AND AMIABLE SMILE.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM SORRY, MARYA TIMOFYEVNA, I FRIGHTENED YOU COMING IN SUDDENLY WHEN YOU WERE ASLEEP,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO HER.

THE SOUND OF HIS CARESSING WORDS PRODUCED THEIR EFFECT. HER FEAR VANISHED, ALTHOUGH SHE STILL LOOKED AT HIM WITH DISMAY, EVIDENTLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING. SHE HELD OUT HER HANDS TIMOROUSLY ALSO. AT LAST A SHY SMILE ROSE TO HER LIPS.

‚ÄÚHOW DO YOU DO, PRINCE?‚ÄÙ SHE WHISPERED, LOOKING AT HIM STRANGELY.

‚ÄÚYOU MUST HAVE HAD A BAD DREAM,‚ÄÙ HE WENT ON, WITH A STILL MORE FRIENDLY AND CORDIAL SMILE.

‚ÄÚBUT HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT I WAS DREAMING ABOUT THAT?‚ÄÙ AND AGAIN SHE BEGAN TREMBLING, AND STARTED BACK, PUTTING UP HER HAND AS THOUGH TO PROTECT HERSELF, ON THE POINT OF CRYING AGAIN. ‚ÄÚCALM YOURSELF. THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH. WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF? SURELY YOU KNOW ME?‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, TRYING TO SOOTHE HER; BUT IT WAS LONG BEFORE HE COULD SUCCEED. SHE GAZED AT HIM DUMBLY WITH THE SAME LOOK OF AGONISING PERPLEXITY, WITH A PAINFUL IDEA IN HER POOR BRAIN, AND SHE STILL SEEMED TO BE TRYING TO REACH SOME CONCLUSION. AT ONE MOMENT SHE DROPPED HER EYES, THEN SUDDENLY SCRUTINISED HIM IN A RAPID COMPREHENSIVE GLANCE. AT LAST, THOUGH NOT REASSURED, SHE SEEMED TO COME TO A CONCLUSION.

‚ÄÚSIT DOWN BESIDE ME, PLEASE, THAT I MAY LOOK AT YOU THOROUGHLY LATER ON,‚ÄÙ SHE BROUGHT OUT WITH MORE FIRMNESS, EVIDENTLY WITH A NEW OBJECT. ‚ÄÚBUT DON‚ÄÔT BE UNEASY, I WON‚ÄÔT LOOK AT YOU NOW. I‚ÄÔLL LOOK DOWN. DON‚ÄÔT YOU LOOK AT ME EITHER TILL I ASK YOU TO. SIT DOWN,‚ÄÙ SHE ADDED, WITH POSITIVE IMPATIENCE.

A NEW SENSATION WAS OBVIOUSLY GROWING STRONGER AND STRONGER IN HER.

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SAT DOWN AND WAITED. RATHER A LONG SILENCE FOLLOWED.

‚ÄÚH‚ÄÔM! IT ALL SEEMS SO STRANGE TO ME,‚ÄÙ SHE SUDDENLY MUTTERED ALMOST DISDAINFULLY. ‚ÄÚOF COURSE I WAS DEPRESSED BY BAD DREAMS, BUT WHY HAVE I DREAMT OF YOU LOOKING LIKE THAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCOME, LET‚ÄÔS HAVE DONE WITH DREAMS,‚ÄÙ HE SAID IMPATIENTLY, TURNING TO HER IN SPITE OF HER PROHIBITION, AND PERHAPS THE SAME EXPRESSION GLEAMED FOR A MOMENT IN HIS EYES AGAIN. HE SAW THAT SHE SEVERAL TIMES WANTED, VERY MUCH IN FACT, TO LOOK AT HIM AGAIN, BUT THAT SHE OBSTINATELY CONTROLLED HERSELF AND KEPT HER EYES CAST DOWN.

‚ÄÚLISTEN, PRINCE,‚ÄÙ SHE RAISED HER VOICE SUDDENLY, ‚ÄÚLISTEN PRINCE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY DO YOU TURN AWAY? WHY DON‚ÄÔT YOU LOOK AT ME? WHAT‚ÄÔS THE OBJECT OF THIS FARCE?‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, LOSING PATIENCE.

BUT SHE SEEMED NOT TO HEAR HIM.

‚ÄÚLISTEN, PRINCE,‚ÄÙ SHE REPEATED FOR THE THIRD TIME IN A RESOLUTE VOICE, WITH A DISAGREEABLE, FUSSY EXPRESSION. ‚ÄÚWHEN YOU TOLD ME IN THE CARRIAGE THAT OUR MARRIAGE WAS GOING TO BE MADE PUBLIC, I WAS ALARMED AT THERE BEING AN END TO THE MYSTERY. NOW I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW. I‚ÄÔVE BEEN THINKING IT ALL OVER, AND I SEE CLEARLY THAT I‚ÄÔM NOT FIT FOR IT AT ALL. I KNOW HOW TO DRESS, AND I COULD RECEIVE GUESTS, PERHAPS. THERE‚ÄÔS NOTHING MUCH IN ASKING PEOPLE TO HAVE A CUP OF TEA, ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE FOOTMEN. BUT WHAT WILL PEOPLE SAY THOUGH? I SAW A GREAT DEAL THAT SUNDAY MORNING IN THAT HOUSE. THAT PRETTY YOUNG LADY LOOKED AT ME ALL THE TIME, ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU CAME IN. IT WAS YOU CAME IN, WASN‚ÄÔT IT? HER MOTHER‚ÄÔS SIMPLY AN ABSURD WORLDLY OLD WOMAN. MY LEBYADKIN DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF TOO. I KEPT LOOKING AT THE CEILING TO KEEP FROM LAUGHING; THE CEILING THERE IS FINELY PAINTED. HIS MOTHER OUGHT TO BE AN ABBESS. I‚ÄÔM AFRAID OF HER, THOUGH SHE DID GIVE ME A BLACK SHAWL. OF COURSE, THEY MUST ALL HAVE COME TO STRANGE CONCLUSIONS ABOUT ME. I WASN‚ÄÔT VEXED, BUT I SAT THERE, THINKING WHAT RELATION AM I TO THEM? OF COURSE, FROM A COUNTESS ONE DOESN‚ÄÔT EXPECT ANY BUT SPIRITUAL QUALITIES; FOR THE DOMESTIC ONES SHE‚ÄÔS GOT PLENTY OF FOOTMEN; AND ALSO A LITTLE WORLDLY COQUETRY, SO AS TO BE ABLE TO ENTERTAIN FOREIGN TRAVELLERS. BUT YET THAT SUNDAY THEY DID LOOK UPON ME AS HOPELESS. ONLY DASHA‚ÄÔS AN ANGEL. I‚ÄÔM AWFULLY AFRAID THEY MAY WOUND HIM BY SOME CARELESS ALLUSION TO ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT BE AFRAID, AND DON‚ÄÔT BE UNEASY,‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, MAKING A WRY FACE.

‚ÄÚHOWEVER, THAT DOESN‚ÄÔT MATTER TO ME, IF HE IS A LITTLE ASHAMED OF ME, FOR THERE WILL ALWAYS BE MORE PITY THAN SHAME, THOUGH IT DIFFERS WITH PEOPLE, OF COURSE. HE KNOWS, TO BE SURE, THAT I OUGHT RATHER TO PITY THEM THAN THEY ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU SEEM TO BE VERY MUCH OFFENDED WITH THEM, MARYA TIMOFYEVNA?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI? OH, NO,‚ÄÙ SHE SMILED WITH SIMPLE-HEARTED MIRTH. ‚ÄÚNOT AT ALL. I LOOKED AT YOU ALL, THEN. YOU WERE ALL ANGRY, YOU WERE ALL QUARRELLING. THEY MEET TOGETHER, AND THEY DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HOW TO LAUGH FROM THEIR HEARTS. SO MUCH WEALTH AND SO LITTLE GAIETY. IT ALL DISGUSTS ME. THOUGH I FEEL FOR NO ONE NOW EXCEPT MYSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE HEARD THAT YOU‚ÄÔVE HAD A HARD LIFE WITH YOUR BROTHER WITHOUT ME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHO TOLD YOU THAT? IT‚ÄÔS NONSENSE. IT‚ÄÔS MUCH WORSE NOW. NOW MY DREAMS ARE NOT GOOD, AND MY DREAMS ARE BAD, BECAUSE YOU‚ÄÔVE COME. WHAT HAVE YOU COME FOR, I‚ÄÔD LIKE TO KNOW. TELL ME PLEASE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWOULDN‚ÄÔT YOU LIKE TO GO BACK INTO THE NUNNERY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNEW THEY‚ÄÔD SUGGEST THE NUNNERY AGAIN. YOUR NUNNERY IS A FINE MARVEL FOR ME! AND WHY SHOULD I GO TO IT? WHAT SHOULD I GO FOR NOW? I‚ÄÔM ALL ALONE IN THE WORLD NOW. IT‚ÄÔS TOO LATE FOR ME TO BEGIN A THIRD LIFE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU SEEM VERY ANGRY ABOUT SOMETHING. SURELY YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT AFRAID THAT I‚ÄÔVE LEFT OFF LOVING YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM NOT TROUBLING ABOUT YOU AT ALL. I‚ÄÔM AFRAID THAT I MAY LEAVE OFF LOVING SOMEBODY.‚ÄÙ

SHE LAUGHED CONTEMPTUOUSLY.

‚ÄÚI MUST HAVE DONE HIM SOME GREAT WRONG,‚ÄÙ SHE ADDED SUDDENLY, AS IT WERE TO HERSELF, ‚ÄÚONLY I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT I‚ÄÔVE DONE WRONG; THAT‚ÄÔS ALWAYS WHAT TROUBLES ME. ALWAYS, ALWAYS, FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS. I‚ÄÔVE BEEN AFRAID DAY AND NIGHT THAT I‚ÄÔVE DONE HIM SOME WRONG. I‚ÄÔVE PRAYED AND PRAYED AND ALWAYS THOUGHT OF THE GREAT WRONG I‚ÄÔD DONE HIM. AND NOW IT TURNS OUT IT WAS TRUE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS TURNED OUT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM ONLY AFRAID WHETHER THERE‚ÄÔS SOMETHING ON HIS SIDE,‚ÄÙ SHE WENT ON, NOT ANSWERING HIS QUESTION, NOT HEARING IT IN FACT. ‚ÄÚAND THEN, AGAIN, HE COULDN‚ÄÔT GET ON WITH SUCH HORRID PEOPLE. THE COUNTESS WOULD HAVE LIKED TO EAT ME, THOUGH SHE DID MAKE ME SIT IN THE CARRIAGE BESIDE HER. THEY‚ÄÔRE ALL IN THE PLOT. SURELY HE‚ÄÔS NOT BETRAYED ME?‚ÄÙ (HER CHIN AND LIPS WERE TWITCHING.) ‚ÄÚTELL ME, HAVE YOU READ ABOUT GRISHKA OTREPYEV, HOW HE WAS CURSED IN SEVEN CATHEDRALS?‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH DID NOT SPEAK.

‚ÄÚBUT I‚ÄÔLL TURN ROUND NOW AND LOOK AT YOU.‚ÄÙ SHE SEEMED TO DECIDE SUDDENLY. ‚ÄÚYOU TURN TO ME, TOO, AND LOOK AT ME, BUT MORE ATTENTIVELY. I WANT TO MAKE SURE FOR THE LAST TIME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE BEEN LOOKING AT YOU FOR A LONG TIME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚH‚ÄÔM!‚ÄÙ SAID MARYA TIMOFYEVNA, LOOKING AT HIM INTENTLY. ‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE GROWN MUCH FATTER.‚ÄÙ

SHE WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING MORE, BUT SUDDENLY, FOR THE THIRD TIME, THE SAME TERROR INSTANTLY DISTORTED HER FACE, AND AGAIN SHE DREW BACK, PUTTING HER HAND UP BEFORE HER.

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THE MATTER WITH YOU?‚ÄÙ CRIED NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, ALMOST ENRAGED.

BUT HER PANIC LASTED ONLY ONE INSTANT, HER FACE WORKED WITH A SORT OF STRANGE SMILE, SUSPICIOUS AND UNPLEASANT.

‚ÄÚI BEG YOU, PRINCE, GET UP AND COME IN,‚ÄÙ SHE BROUGHT OUT SUDDENLY, IN A FIRM, EMPHATIC VOICE.

‚ÄÚCOME IN? WHERE AM I TO COME IN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE BEEN FANCYING FOR FIVE YEARS HOW HE WOULD COME IN. GET UP AND GO OUT OF THE DOOR INTO THE OTHER ROOM. I‚ÄÔLL SIT AS THOUGH I WEREN‚ÄÔT EXPECTING ANYTHING, AND I‚ÄÔLL TAKE UP A BOOK, AND SUDDENLY YOU‚ÄÔLL COME IN AFTER FIVE YEARS‚ÄÔ TRAVELLING. I WANT TO SEE WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE.‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH GROUND HIS TEETH, AND MUTTERED SOMETHING TO HIMSELF.

‚ÄÚENOUGH,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, STRIKING THE TABLE WITH HIS OPEN HAND. ‚ÄÚI BEG YOU TO LISTEN TO ME, MARYA TIMOFYEVNA. DO ME THE FAVOUR TO CONCENTRATE ALL YOUR ATTENTION IF YOU CAN. YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT ALTOGETHER MAD, YOU KNOW!‚ÄÙ HE BROKE OUT IMPATIENTLY. ‚ÄÚTOMORROW I SHALL MAKE OUR MARRIAGE PUBLIC. YOU NEVER WILL LIVE IN A PALACE, GET THAT OUT OF YOUR HEAD. DO YOU WANT TO LIVE WITH ME FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, ONLY VERY FAR AWAY FROM HERE? IN THE MOUNTAINS IN SWITZERLAND, THERE‚ÄÔS A PLACE THERE.‚Ä¶ DON‚ÄÔT BE AFRAID. I‚ÄÔLL NEVER ABANDON YOU OR PUT YOU IN A MADHOUSE. I SHALL HAVE MONEY ENOUGH TO LIVE WITHOUT ASKING ANYONE‚ÄÔS HELP. YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT, YOU SHALL DO NO WORK AT ALL. EVERYTHING YOU WANT THAT‚ÄÔS POSSIBLE SHALL BE GOT FOR YOU. YOU SHALL PRAY, GO WHERE YOU LIKE, AND DO WHAT YOU LIKE. I WON‚ÄÔT TOUCH YOU. I WON‚ÄÔT GO AWAY FROM THE PLACE MYSELF AT ALL. IF YOU LIKE, I WON‚ÄÔT SPEAK TO YOU ALL MY LIFE, OR IF YOU LIKE, YOU CAN TELL ME YOUR STORIES EVERY EVENING AS YOU USED TO DO IN PETERSBURG IN THE CORNERS. I‚ÄÔLL READ ALOUD TO YOU IF YOU LIKE. BUT IT MUST BE ALL YOUR LIFE IN THE SAME PLACE, AND THAT PLACE IS A GLOOMY ONE. WILL YOU? ARE YOU READY? YOU WON‚ÄÔT REGRET IT, TORMENT ME WITH TEARS AND CURSES, WILL YOU?‚ÄÙ

SHE LISTENED WITH EXTREME CURIOSITY, AND FOR A LONG TIME SHE WAS SILENT, THINKING.

‚ÄÚIT ALL SEEMS INCREDIBLE TO ME,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID AT LAST, IRONICALLY AND DISDAINFULLY. ‚ÄÚI MIGHT LIVE FOR FORTY YEARS IN THOSE MOUNTAINS,‚ÄÙ SHE LAUGHED.

‚ÄÚWHAT OF IT? LET‚ÄÔS LIVE FORTY YEARS THEN ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, SCOWLING.

‚ÄÚH‚ÄÔM! I WON‚ÄÔT COME FOR ANYTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOT EVEN WITH ME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND WHAT ARE YOU THAT I SHOULD GO WITH YOU? I‚ÄÔM TO SIT ON A MOUNTAIN BESIDE HIM FOR FORTY YEARS ON END‚ÄÎA PRETTY STORY! AND UPON MY WORD, HOW LONG-SUFFERING PEOPLE HAVE BECOME NOWADAYS! NO, IT CANNOT BE THAT A FALCON HAS BECOME AN OWL. MY PRINCE IS NOT LIKE THAT!‚ÄÙ SHE SAID, RAISING HER HEAD PROUDLY AND TRIUMPHANTLY.

LIGHT SEEMED TO DAWN UPON HIM.

‚ÄÚWHAT MAKES YOU CALL ME A PRINCE, AND ‚Ä¶ FOR WHOM DO YOU TAKE ME?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED QUICKLY.

‚ÄÚWHY, AREN‚ÄÔT YOU THE PRINCE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI NEVER HAVE BEEN ONE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSO YOURSELF, YOURSELF, YOU TELL ME STRAIGHT TO MY FACE THAT YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT THE PRINCE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI TELL YOU I NEVER HAVE BEEN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGOOD LORD!‚ÄÙ SHE CRIED, CLASPING HER HANDS. ‚ÄÚI WAS READY TO EXPECT ANYTHING FROM HIS ENEMIES, BUT SUCH INSOLENCE, NEVER! IS HE ALIVE?‚ÄÙ SHE SHRIEKED IN A FRENZY, TURNING UPON NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH. ‚ÄÚHAVE YOU KILLED HIM? CONFESS!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHOM DO YOU TAKE ME FOR?‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, JUMPING UP FROM HIS CHAIR WITH A DISTORTED FACE; BUT IT WAS NOT EASY NOW TO FRIGHTEN HER. SHE WAS TRIUMPHANT.

‚ÄÚWHO CAN TELL WHO YOU ARE AND WHERE YOU‚ÄÔVE SPRUNG FROM? ONLY MY HEART, MY HEART HAD MISGIVINGS ALL THESE FIVE YEARS, OF ALL THE INTRIGUES. AND I‚ÄÔVE BEEN SITTING HERE WONDERING WHAT BLIND OWL WAS MAKING UP TO ME? NO, MY DEAR, YOU‚ÄÔRE A POOR ACTOR, WORSE THAN LEBYADKIN EVEN. GIVE MY HUMBLE GREETINGS TO THE COUNTESS AND TELL HER TO SEND SOMEONE BETTER THAN YOU. HAS SHE HIRED YOU, TELL ME? HAVE THEY GIVEN YOU A PLACE IN HER KITCHEN OUT OF CHARITY? I SEE THROUGH YOUR DECEPTION. I UNDERSTAND YOU ALL, EVERY ONE OF YOU.‚ÄÙ

HE SEIZED HER FIRMLY ABOVE THE ELBOW; SHE LAUGHED IN HIS FACE.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE LIKE HIM, VERY LIKE, PERHAPS YOU‚ÄÔRE A RELATION‚ÄÎYOU‚ÄÔRE A SLY LOT! ONLY MINE IS A BRIGHT FALCON AND A PRINCE, AND YOU‚ÄÔRE AN OWL, AND A SHOPMAN! MINE WILL BOW DOWN TO GOD IF IT PLEASES HIM, AND WON‚ÄÔT IF IT DOESN‚ÄÔT. AND SHATUSHKA (HE‚ÄÔS MY DEAR, MY DARLING!) SLAPPED YOU ON THE CHEEKS, MY LEBYADKIN TOLD ME. AND WHAT WERE YOU AFRAID OF THEN, WHEN YOU CAME IN? WHO HAD FRIGHTENED YOU THEN? WHEN I SAW YOUR MEAN FACE AFTER I‚ÄÔD FALLEN DOWN AND YOU PICKED ME UP‚ÄÎIT WAS LIKE A WORM CRAWLING INTO MY HEART. IT‚ÄÔS NOT HE, I THOUGHT, NOT HE! MY FALCON WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ASHAMED OF ME BEFORE A FASHIONABLE YOUNG LADY. OH HEAVENS! THAT ALONE KEPT ME HAPPY FOR THOSE FIVE YEARS THAT MY FALCON WAS LIVING SOMEWHERE BEYOND THE MOUNTAINS, SOARING, GAZING AT THE SUN.‚Ä¶ TELL ME, YOU IMPOSTOR, HAVE YOU GOT MUCH BY IT? DID YOU NEED A BIG BRIBE TO CONSENT? I WOULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE GIVEN YOU A FARTHING. HA HA HA! HA HA!‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚUGH, IDIOT!‚ÄÙ SNARLED NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, STILL HOLDING HER TIGHT BY THE ARM.

‚ÄÚGO AWAY, IMPOSTOR!‚ÄÙ SHE SHOUTED PEREMPTORILY. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM THE WIFE OF MY PRINCE; I‚ÄÔM NOT AFRAID OF YOUR KNIFE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚKNIFE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, KNIFE, YOU‚ÄÔVE A KNIFE IN YOUR POCKET. YOU THOUGHT I WAS ASLEEP BUT I SAW IT. WHEN YOU CAME IN JUST NOW YOU TOOK OUT YOUR KNIFE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT ARE YOU SAYING, UNHAPPY CREATURE? WHAT DREAMS YOU HAVE!‚ÄÙ HE EXCLAIMED, PUSHING HER AWAY FROM HIM WITH ALL HIS MIGHT, SO THAT HER HEAD AND SHOULDERS FELL PAINFULLY AGAINST THE SOFA. HE WAS RUSHING AWAY; BUT SHE AT ONCE FLEW TO OVERTAKE HIM, LIMPING AND HOPPING, AND THOUGH LEBYADKIN, PANIC-STRICKEN, HELD HER BACK WITH ALL HIS MIGHT, SHE SUCCEEDED IN SHOUTING AFTER HIM INTO THE DARKNESS, SHRIEKING AND LAUGHING:

‚ÄÚA CURSE ON YOU, GRISHKA OTREPYEV!‚ÄÙ

IV

‚ÄÚA KNIFE, A KNIFE,‚ÄÙ HE REPEATED WITH UNCONTROLLABLE ANGER, STRIDING ALONG THROUGH THE MUD AND PUDDLES, WITHOUT PICKING HIS WAY. IT IS TRUE THAT AT MOMENTS HE HAD A TERRIBLE DESIRE TO LAUGH ALOUD FRANTICALLY; BUT FOR SOME REASON HE CONTROLLED HIMSELF AND RESTRAINED HIS LAUGHTER. HE RECOVERED HIMSELF ONLY ON THE BRIDGE, ON THE SPOT WHERE FEDKA HAD MET HIM THAT EVENING. HE FOUND THE MAN LYING IN WAIT FOR HIM AGAIN. SEEING NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HE TOOK OFF HIS CAP, GRINNED GAILY, AND BEGAN BABBLING BRISKLY AND MERRILY ABOUT SOMETHING. AT FIRST NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WALKED ON WITHOUT STOPPING, AND FOR SOME TIME DID NOT EVEN LISTEN TO THE TRAMP WHO WAS PESTERING HIM AGAIN. HE WAS SUDDENLY STRUCK BY THE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN HIM, AND HAD FORGOTTEN HIM AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN HE HIMSELF WAS REPEATING, ‚ÄÚA KNIFE, A KNIFE.‚ÄÙ HE SEIZED THE TRAMP BY THE COLLAR AND GAVE VENT TO HIS PENT-UP RAGE BY FLINGING HIM VIOLENTLY AGAINST THE BRIDGE. FOR ONE INSTANT THE MAN THOUGHT OF FIGHTING, BUT ALMOST AT ONCE REALISING THAT COMPARED WITH HIS ADVERSARY, WHO HAD FALLEN UPON HIM UNAWARES, HE WAS NO BETTER THAN A WISP OF STRAW, HE SUBSIDED AND WAS SILENT, WITHOUT OFFERING ANY RESISTANCE. CROUCHING ON THE GROUND WITH HIS ELBOWS CROOKED BEHIND HIS BACK, THE WILY TRAMP CALMLY WAITED FOR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT, APPARENTLY QUITE INCREDULOUS OF DANGER. HE WAS RIGHT IN HIS RECKONING. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAD ALREADY WITH HIS LEFT HAND TAKEN OFF HIS THICK SCARF TO TIE HIS PRISONER‚ÄÔS ARMS, BUT SUDDENLY, FOR SOME REASON, HE ABANDONED HIM, AND SHOVED HIM AWAY. THE MAN INSTANTLY SPRANG ON TO HIS FEET, TURNED ROUND, AND A SHORT, BROAD BOOT-KNIFE SUDDENLY GLEAMED IN HIS HAND.

‚ÄÚAWAY WITH THAT KNIFE; PUT IT AWAY, AT ONCE!‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH COMMANDED WITH AN IMPATIENT GESTURE, AND THE KNIFE VANISHED AS INSTANTANEOUSLY AS IT HAD APPEARED.

WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OR TURNING ROUND, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WENT ON HIS WAY. BUT THE PERSISTENT VAGABOND DID NOT LEAVE HIM EVEN NOW, THOUGH NOW, IT IS TRUE, HE DID NOT CHATTER, AND EVEN RESPECTFULLY KEPT HIS DISTANCE, A FULL STEP BEHIND.

THEY CROSSED THE BRIDGE LIKE THIS AND CAME OUT ON TO THE RIVER BANK, TURNING THIS TIME TO THE LEFT, AGAIN INTO A LONG DESERTED BACK STREET, WHICH LED TO THE CENTRE OF THE TOWN BY A SHORTER WAY THAN GOING THROUGH BOGOYAVLENSKY STREET.

‚ÄÚIS IT TRUE, AS THEY SAY, THAT YOU ROBBED A CHURCH IN THE DISTRICT THE OTHER DAY?‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH ASKED SUDDENLY.

‚ÄÚI WENT IN TO SAY MY PRAYERS IN THE FIRST PLACE,‚ÄÙ THE TRAMP ANSWERED, SEDATELY AND RESPECTFULLY AS THOUGH NOTHING HAD HAPPENED; MORE THAN SEDATELY, IN FACT, ALMOST WITH DIGNITY. THERE WAS NO TRACE OF HIS FORMER ‚ÄÚFRIENDLY‚ÄÙ FAMILIARITY. ALL THAT WAS TO BE SEEN WAS A SERIOUS, BUSINESS-LIKE MAN, WHO HAD INDEED BEEN GRATUITOUSLY INSULTED, BUT WHO WAS CAPABLE OF OVERLOOKING AN INSULT.

‚ÄÚBUT WHEN THE LORD LED ME THERE,‚ÄÙ HE WENT ON, ‚ÄÚECH, I THOUGHT WHAT A HEAVENLY ABUNDANCE! IT WAS ALL OWING TO MY HELPLESS STATE, AS IN OUR WAY OF LIFE THERE‚ÄÔS NO DOING WITHOUT ASSISTANCE. AND, NOW, GOD BE MY WITNESS, SIR, IT WAS MY OWN LOSS. THE LORD PUNISHED ME FOR MY SINS, AND WHAT WITH THE CENSER AND THE DEACON‚ÄÔS HALTER, I ONLY GOT TWELVE ROUBLES ALTOGETHER. THE CHIN SETTING OF ST. NIKOLAY OF PURE SILVER WENT FOR NEXT TO NOTHING. THEY SAID IT WAS PLATED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU KILLED THE WATCHMAN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT IS, I CLEARED THE PLACE OUT TOGETHER WITH THAT WATCHMAN, BUT AFTERWARDS, NEXT MORNING, BY THE RIVER, WE FELL TO QUARRELLING WHICH SHOULD CARRY THE SACK. I SINNED, I DID LIGHTEN HIS LOAD FOR HIM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, YOU CAN ROB AND MURDER AGAIN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS THE VERY ADVICE PYOTR STEPANOVITCH GIVES ME, IN THE VERY SAME WORDS, FOR HE‚ÄÔS UNCOMMONLY MEAN AND HARD-HEARTED ABOUT HELPING A FELLOW-CREATURE. AND WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, HE HASN‚ÄÔT A HA‚ÄÔP‚ÄÔORTH OF BELIEF IN THE HEAVENLY CREATOR, WHO MADE US OUT OF EARTHLY CLAY; BUT HE SAYS IT‚ÄÔS ALL THE WORK OF NATURE EVEN TO THE LAST BEAST. HE DOESN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND EITHER THAT WITH OUR WAY OF LIFE IT‚ÄÔS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO GET ALONG WITHOUT FRIENDLY ASSISTANCE. IF YOU BEGIN TO TALK TO HIM HE LOOKS LIKE A SHEEP AT THE WATER; IT MAKES ONE WONDER. WOULD YOU BELIEVE, AT CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS, OUT YONDER, WHOM YOUR HONOUR‚ÄÔS JUST BEEN VISITING, WHEN HE WAS LIVING AT FILIPOV‚ÄÔS, BEFORE YOU CAME, THE DOOR STOOD OPEN ALL NIGHT LONG. HE‚ÄÔD BE DRUNK AND SLEEPING LIKE THE DEAD, AND HIS MONEY DROPPING OUT OF HIS POCKETS ALL OVER THE FLOOR. I‚ÄÔVE CHANCED TO SEE IT WITH MY OWN EYES, FOR IN OUR WAY OF LIFE IT‚ÄÔS IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE WITHOUT ASSISTANCE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW DO YOU MEAN WITH YOUR OWN EYES? DID YOU GO IN AT NIGHT THEN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMAYBE I DID GO IN, BUT NO ONE KNOWS OF IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY DIDN‚ÄÔT YOU KILL HIM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚRECKONING IT OUT, I STEADIED MYSELF. FOR ONCE HAVING LEARNED FOR SURE THAT I CAN ALWAYS GET ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ROUBLES, WHY SHOULD I GO SO FAR WHEN I CAN GET FIFTEEN HUNDRED ROUBLES, IF I ONLY BIDE MY TIME. FOR CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN (I‚ÄÔVE HEARD HIM WITH MY OWN EARS) HAD GREAT HOPES OF YOU WHEN HE WAS DRUNK; AND THERE ISN‚ÄÔT A TAVERN HERE‚ÄÎNOT THE LOWEST POT-HOUSE‚ÄÎWHERE HE HASN‚ÄÔT TALKED ABOUT IT WHEN HE WAS IN THAT STATE. SO THAT HEARING IT FROM MANY LIPS, I BEGAN, TOO, TO REST ALL MY HOPES ON YOUR EXCELLENCY. I SPEAK TO YOU, SIR, AS TO MY FATHER, OR MY OWN BROTHER; FOR PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WILL NEVER LEARN THAT FROM ME, AND NOT A SOUL IN THE WORLD. SO WON‚ÄÔT YOUR EXCELLENCY SPARE ME THREE ROUBLES IN YOUR KINDNESS? YOU MIGHT SET MY MIND AT REST, SO THAT I MIGHT KNOW THE REAL TRUTH; FOR WE CAN‚ÄÔT GET ON WITHOUT ASSISTANCE.‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH LAUGHED ALOUD, AND TAKING OUT HIS PURSE, IN WHICH HE HAD AS MUCH AS FIFTY ROUBLES, IN SMALL NOTES, THREW HIM ONE NOTE OUT OF THE BUNDLE, THEN A SECOND, A THIRD, A FOURTH. FEDKA FLEW TO CATCH THEM IN THE AIR. THE NOTES DROPPED INTO THE MUD, AND HE SNATCHED THEM UP CRYING, ‚ÄÚECH! ECH!‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH FINISHED BY FLINGING THE WHOLE BUNDLE AT HIM, AND, STILL LAUGHING, WENT ON DOWN THE STREET, THIS TIME ALONE. THE TRAMP REMAINED CRAWLING ON HIS KNEES IN THE MUD, LOOKING FOR THE NOTES WHICH WERE BLOWN ABOUT BY THE WIND AND SOAKING IN THE PUDDLES, AND FOR AN HOUR AFTER HIS SPASMODIC CRIES OF ‚ÄÚECH! ECH!‚ÄÙ WERE STILL TO BE HEARD IN THE DARKNESS.





CHAPTER III. THE DUEL

I

THE NEXT DAY, AT TWO O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON, THE DUEL TOOK PLACE AS ARRANGED. THINGS WERE HASTENED FORWARD BY GAGANOV‚ÄÔS OBSTINATE DESIRE TO FIGHT AT ALL COSTS. HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS ADVERSARY‚ÄÔS CONDUCT, AND WAS IN A FURY. FOR A WHOLE MONTH HE HAD BEEN INSULTING HIM WITH IMPUNITY, AND HAD SO FAR BEEN UNABLE TO MAKE HIM LOSE PATIENCE. WHAT HE WANTED WAS A CHALLENGE ON THE PART OF NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, AS HE HAD NOT HIMSELF ANY DIRECT PRETEXT FOR CHALLENGING HIM. HIS SECRET MOTIVE FOR IT, THAT IS, HIS ALMOST MORBID HATRED OF STAVROGIN FOR THE INSULT TO HIS FAMILY FOUR YEARS BEFORE, HE WAS FOR SOME REASON ASHAMED TO CONFESS. AND INDEED HE REGARDED THIS HIMSELF AS AN IMPOSSIBLE PRETEXT FOR A CHALLENGE, ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE HUMBLE APOLOGY OFFERED BY NIKOLAY STAVROGIN TWICE ALREADY. HE PRIVATELY MADE UP HIS MIND THAT STAVROGIN WAS A SHAMELESS COWARD; AND COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW HE COULD HAVE ACCEPTED SHATOV‚ÄÔS BLOW. SO HE MADE UP HIS MIND AT LAST TO SEND HIM THE EXTRAORDINARILY RUDE LETTER THAT HAD FINALLY ROUSED NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HIMSELF TO PROPOSE A MEETING. HAVING DISPATCHED THIS LETTER THE DAY BEFORE, HE AWAITED A CHALLENGE WITH FEVERISH IMPATIENCE, AND WHILE MORBIDLY RECKONING THE CHANCES AT ONE MOMENT WITH HOPE AND AT THE NEXT WITH DESPAIR, HE GOT READY FOR ANY EMERGENCY BY SECURING A SECOND, TO WIT, MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH DROZDOV, WHO WAS A FRIEND OF HIS, AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW, A MAN FOR WHOM HE HAD A GREAT RESPECT. SO WHEN KIRILLOV CAME NEXT MORNING AT NINE O‚ÄÔCLOCK WITH HIS MESSAGE HE FOUND THINGS IN READINESS. ALL THE APOLOGIES AND UNHEARD-OF CONDESCENSION OF NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WERE AT ONCE, AT THE FIRST WORD, REJECTED WITH EXTRAORDINARY EXASPERATION. MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, WHO HAD ONLY BEEN MADE ACQUAINTED WITH THE POSITION OF AFFAIRS THE EVENING BEFORE, OPENED HIS MOUTH WITH SURPRISE AT SUCH INCREDIBLE CONCESSIONS, AND WOULD HAVE URGED A RECONCILIATION, BUT SEEING THAT GAGANOV, GUESSING HIS INTENTION, WAS ALMOST TREMBLING IN HIS CHAIR, REFRAINED, AND SAID NOTHING. IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE PROMISE GIVEN TO HIS OLD SCHOOLFELLOW HE WOULD HAVE RETIRED IMMEDIATELY; HE ONLY REMAINED IN THE HOPE OF BEING SOME HELP ON THE SCENE OF ACTION. KIRILLOV REPEATED THE CHALLENGE. ALL THE CONDITIONS OF THE ENCOUNTER MADE BY STAVROGIN WERE ACCEPTED ON THE SPOT, WITHOUT THE FAINTEST OBJECTION. ONLY ONE ADDITION WAS MADE, AND THAT A FEROCIOUS ONE. IF THE FIRST SHOTS HAD NO DECISIVE EFFECT, THEY WERE TO FIRE AGAIN, AND IF THE SECOND ENCOUNTER WERE INCONCLUSIVE, IT WAS TO BE FOLLOWED BY A THIRD. KIRILLOV FROWNED, OBJECTED TO THE THIRD ENCOUNTER, BUT GAINING NOTHING BY HIS EFFORTS AGREED ON THE CONDITION, HOWEVER, THAT THREE SHOULD BE THE LIMIT, AND THAT ‚ÄÚA FOURTH ENCOUNTER WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION.‚ÄÙ THIS WAS CONCEDED. ACCORDINGLY AT TWO O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THE MEETING TOOK PLACE AT BRYKOV, THAT IS, IN A LITTLE COPSE IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE TOWN, LYING BETWEEN SKVORESHNIKI AND THE SHPIGULIN FACTORY. THE RAIN OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT WAS OVER, BUT IT WAS DAMP, GREY, AND WINDY. LOW, RAGGED, DINGY CLOUDS MOVED RAPIDLY ACROSS THE COLD SKY. THE TREE-TOPS ROARED WITH A DEEP DRONING SOUND, AND CREAKED ON THEIR ROOTS; IT WAS A MELANCHOLY MORNING.

MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH AND GAGANOV ARRIVED ON THE SPOT IN A SMART CHAR-√†-BANC WITH A PAIR OF HORSES DRIVEN BY THE LATTER. THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A GROOM. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH AND KIRILLOV ARRIVED ALMOST AT THE SAME INSTANT. THEY WERE NOT DRIVING, THEY WERE ON HORSEBACK, AND WERE ALSO FOLLOWED BY A MOUNTED SERVANT. KIRILLOV, WHO HAD NEVER MOUNTED A HORSE BEFORE, SAT UP BOLDLY, ERECT IN THE SADDLE, GRASPING IN HIS RIGHT HAND THE HEAVY BOX OF PISTOLS WHICH HE WOULD NOT ENTRUST TO THE SERVANT. IN HIS INEXPERIENCE HE WAS CONTINUALLY WITH HIS LEFT HAND TUGGING AT THE REINS, WHICH MADE THE HORSE TOSS HIS HEAD AND SHOW AN INCLINATION TO REAR. THIS, HOWEVER, SEEMED TO CAUSE HIS RIDER NO UNEASINESS. GAGANOV, WHO WAS MORBIDLY SUSPICIOUS AND ALWAYS READY TO BE DEEPLY OFFENDED, CONSIDERED THEIR COMING ON HORSEBACK AS A FRESH INSULT TO HIMSELF, INASMUCH AS IT SHOWED THAT HIS OPPONENTS WERE TOO CONFIDENT OF SUCCESS, SINCE THEY HAD NOT EVEN THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO HAVE A CARRIAGE IN CASE OF BEING WOUNDED AND DISABLED. HE GOT OUT OF HIS CHAR-√†-BANC, YELLOW WITH ANGER, AND FELT THAT HIS HANDS WERE TREMBLING, AS HE TOLD MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH. HE MADE NO RESPONSE AT ALL TO NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH‚ÄÔS BOW, AND TURNED AWAY. THE SECONDS CAST LOTS. THE LOT FELL ON KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS PISTOLS. THEY MEASURED OUT THE BARRIER AND PLACED THE COMBATANTS. THE SERVANTS WITH THE CARRIAGE AND HORSES WERE MOVED BACK THREE HUNDRED PACES. THE WEAPONS WERE LOADED AND HANDED TO THE COMBATANTS.

I‚ÄÔM SORRY THAT I HAVE TO TELL MY STORY MORE QUICKLY AND HAVE NO TIME FOR DESCRIPTIONS. BUT I CAN‚ÄÔT REFRAIN FROM SOME COMMENTS. MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH WAS MELANCHOLY AND PREOCCUPIED. KIRILLOV, ON THE OTHER HAND, WAS PERFECTLY CALM AND UNCONCERNED, VERY EXACT OVER THE DETAILS OF THE DUTIES HE HAD UNDERTAKEN, BUT WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST FUSSINESS OR EVEN CURIOSITY AS TO THE ISSUE OF THE FATEFUL CONTEST THAT WAS SO NEAR AT HAND. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS PALER THAN USUAL. HE WAS RATHER LIGHTLY DRESSED IN AN OVERCOAT AND A WHITE BEAVER HAT. HE SEEMED VERY TIRED, HE FROWNED FROM TIME TO TIME, AND SEEMED TO FEEL IT SUPERFLUOUS TO CONCEAL HIS ILL-HUMOUR. BUT GAGANOV WAS AT THIS MOMENT MORE WORTHY OF MENTION THAN ANYONE, SO THAT IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT HIM IN PARTICULAR.

II

I HAVE HITHERTO NOT HAD OCCASION TO DESCRIBE HIS APPEARANCE. HE WAS A TALL MAN OF THIRTY-THREE, AND WELL FED, AS THE COMMON FOLK EXPRESS IT, ALMOST FAT, WITH LANK FLAXEN HAIR, AND WITH FEATURES WHICH MIGHT BE CALLED HANDSOME. HE HAD RETIRED FROM THE SERVICE WITH THE RANK OF COLONEL, AND IF HE HAD SERVED TILL HE REACHED THE RANK OF GENERAL HE WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE IN THAT POSITION, AND WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE BECOME AN EXCELLENT FIGHTING GENERAL.

I MUST ADD, AS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MAN, THAT THE CHIEF CAUSE OF HIS LEAVING THE ARMY WAS THE THOUGHT OF THE FAMILY DISGRACE WHICH HAD HAUNTED HIM SO PAINFULLY SINCE THE INSULT PAID TO HIS FATHER BY NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH FOUR YEARS BEFORE AT THE CLUB. HE CONSCIENTIOUSLY CONSIDERED IT DISHONOURABLE TO REMAIN IN THE SERVICE, AND WAS INWARDLY PERSUADED THAT HE WAS CONTAMINATING THE REGIMENT AND HIS COMPANIONS, ALTHOUGH THEY KNEW NOTHING OF THE INCIDENT. IT‚ÄÔS TRUE THAT HE HAD ONCE BEFORE BEEN DISPOSED TO LEAVE THE ARMY LONG BEFORE THE INSULT TO HIS FATHER, AND ON QUITE OTHER GROUNDS, BUT HE HAD HESITATED. STRANGE AS IT IS TO WRITE, THE ORIGINAL DESIGN, OR RATHER DESIRE, TO LEAVE THE ARMY WAS DUE TO THE PROCLAMATION OF THE 19TH OF FEBRUARY OF THE EMANCIPATION OF THE SERFS. GAGANOV, WHO WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST LANDOWNERS IN THE PROVINCE, AND WHO HAD NOT LOST VERY MUCH BY THE EMANCIPATION, AND WAS, MOREOVER, QUITE CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING THE HUMANITY OF THE REFORM AND ITS ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES, SUDDENLY FELT HIMSELF PERSONALLY INSULTED BY THE PROCLAMATION. IT WAS SOMETHING UNCONSCIOUS, A FEELING; BUT WAS ALL THE STRONGER FOR BEING UNRECOGNISED. HE COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF, HOWEVER, TO TAKE ANY DECISIVE STEP TILL HIS FATHER‚ÄÔS DEATH. BUT HE BEGAN TO BE WELL KNOWN FOR HIS ‚ÄÚGENTLEMANLY‚ÄÙ IDEAS TO MANY PERSONS OF HIGH POSITION IN PETERSBURG, WITH WHOM HE STRENUOUSLY KEPT UP CONNECTIONS. HE WAS SECRETIVE AND SELF-CONTAINED. ANOTHER CHARACTERISTIC: HE BELONGED TO THAT STRANGE SECTION OF THE NOBILITY, STILL SURVIVING IN RUSSIA, WHO SET AN EXTREME VALUE ON THEIR PURE AND ANCIENT LINEAGE, AND TAKE IT TOO SERIOUSLY. AT THE SAME TIME HE COULD NOT ENDURE RUSSIAN HISTORY, AND, INDEED, LOOKED UPON RUSSIAN CUSTOMS IN GENERAL AS MORE OR LESS PIGGISH. EVEN IN HIS CHILDHOOD, IN THE SPECIAL MILITARY SCHOOL FOR THE SONS OF PARTICULARLY WEALTHY AND DISTINGUISHED FAMILIES IN WHICH HE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING EDUCATED, FROM FIRST TO LAST CERTAIN POETIC NOTIONS WERE DEEPLY ROOTED IN HIS MIND. HE LOVED CASTLES, CHIVALRY; ALL THE THEATRICAL PART OF IT. HE WAS READY TO CRY WITH SHAME THAT IN THE DAYS OF THE MOSCOW TSARS THE SOVEREIGN HAD THE RIGHT TO INFLICT CORPORAL PUNISHMENT ON THE RUSSIAN BOYARS, AND BLUSHED AT THE CONTRAST. THIS STIFF AND EXTREMELY SEVERE MAN, WHO HAD A REMARKABLE KNOWLEDGE OF MILITARY SCIENCE AND PERFORMED HIS DUTIES ADMIRABLY, WAS AT HEART A DREAMER. IT WAS SAID THAT HE COULD SPEAK AT MEETINGS AND HAD THE GIFT OF LANGUAGE, BUT AT NO TIME DURING THE THIRTY-THREE YEARS OF HIS LIFE HAD HE SPOKEN. EVEN IN THE DISTINGUISHED CIRCLES IN PETERSBURG, IN WHICH HE HAD MOVED OF LATE, HE BEHAVED WITH EXTRAORDINARY HAUGHTINESS. HIS MEETING IN PETERSBURG WITH NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, WHO HAD JUST RETURNED FROM ABROAD, ALMOST SENT HIM OUT OF HIS MIND. AT THE PRESENT MOMENT, STANDING AT THE BARRIER, HE WAS TERRIBLY UNEASY. HE KEPT IMAGINING THAT THE DUEL WOULD SOMEHOW NOT COME OFF; THE LEAST DELAY THREW HIM INTO A TREMOR. THERE WAS AN EXPRESSION OF ANGUISH IN HIS FACE WHEN KIRILLOV, INSTEAD OF GIVING THE SIGNAL FOR THEM TO FIRE, BEGAN SUDDENLY SPEAKING, ONLY FOR FORM, INDEED, AS HE HIMSELF EXPLAINED ALOUD.

‚ÄÚSIMPLY AS A FORMALITY, NOW THAT YOU HAVE THE PISTOLS IN YOUR HANDS, AND I MUST GIVE THE SIGNAL, I ASK YOU FOR THE LAST TIME, WILL YOU NOT BE RECONCILED? IT‚ÄÔS THE DUTY OF A SECOND.‚ÄÙ

AS THOUGH TO SPITE HIM, MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, WHO HAD TILL THEN KEPT SILENCE, ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN REPROACHING HIMSELF ALL DAY FOR HIS COMPLIANCE AND ACQUIESCENCE, SUDDENLY CAUGHT UP KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS THOUGHT AND BEGAN TO SPEAK:

‚ÄÚI ENTIRELY AGREE WITH MR. KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS WORDS.‚Ä¶ THIS IDEA THAT RECONCILIATION IS IMPOSSIBLE AT THE BARRIER IS A PREJUDICE, ONLY SUITABLE FOR FRENCHMEN. BESIDES, WITH YOUR LEAVE, I DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OFFENCE IS. I‚ÄÔVE BEEN WANTING TO SAY SO FOR A LONG TIME ‚Ä¶ BECAUSE EVERY APOLOGY IS OFFERED, ISN‚ÄÔT IT?‚ÄÙ

HE FLUSHED ALL OVER. HE HAD RARELY SPOKEN SO MUCH, AND WITH SUCH EXCITEMENT.

‚ÄÚI REPEAT AGAIN MY OFFER TO MAKE EVERY POSSIBLE APOLOGY,‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH INTERPOSED HURRIEDLY.

‚ÄÚTHIS IS IMPOSSIBLE,‚ÄÙ SHOUTED GAGANOV FURIOUSLY, ADDRESSING MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, AND STAMPING WITH RAGE. ‚ÄÚEXPLAIN TO THIS MAN,‚ÄÙ HE POINTED WITH HIS PISTOL AT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, ‚ÄÚIF YOU‚ÄÔRE MY SECOND AND NOT MY ENEMY, MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, THAT SUCH OVERTURES ONLY AGGRAVATE THE INSULT. HE FEELS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BE INSULTED BY ME!‚Ä¶ HE FEELS IT NO DISGRACE TO WALK AWAY FROM ME AT THE BARRIER! WHAT DOES HE TAKE ME FOR, AFTER THAT, DO YOU THINK?‚Ä¶ AND YOU, YOU, MY SECOND, TOO! YOU‚ÄÔRE SIMPLY IRRITATING ME THAT I MAY MISS.‚ÄÙ

HE STAMPED AGAIN. THERE WERE FLECKS OF FOAM ON HIS LIPS.

‚ÄÚNEGOTIATIONS ARE OVER. I BEG YOU TO LISTEN TO THE SIGNAL!‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV SHOUTED AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE. ‚ÄÚONE! TWO! THREE!‚ÄÙ

AT THE WORD ‚ÄÚTHREE‚ÄÙ THE COMBATANTS TOOK AIM AT ONE ANOTHER. GAGANOV AT ONCE RAISED HIS PISTOL, AND AT THE FIFTH OR SIXTH STEP HE FIRED. FOR A SECOND HE STOOD STILL, AND, MAKING SURE THAT HE HAD MISSED, ADVANCED TO THE BARRIER. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH ADVANCED TOO, RAISING HIS PISTOL, BUT SOMEHOW HOLDING IT VERY HIGH, AND FIRED, ALMOST WITHOUT TAKING AIM. THEN HE TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND BOUND IT ROUND THE LITTLE FINGER OF HIS RIGHT HAND. ONLY THEN THEY SAW THAT GAGANOV HAD NOT MISSED HIM COMPLETELY, BUT THE BULLET HAD ONLY GRAZED THE FLESHY PART OF HIS FINGER WITHOUT TOUCHING THE BONE; IT WAS ONLY A SLIGHT SCRATCH. KIRILLOV AT ONCE ANNOUNCED THAT THE DUEL WOULD GO ON, UNLESS THE COMBATANTS WERE SATISFIED.

‚ÄÚI DECLARE,‚ÄÙ SAID GAGANOV HOARSELY (HIS THROAT FELT PARCHED), AGAIN ADDRESSING MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, ‚ÄÚTHAT THIS MAN,‚ÄÙ AGAIN HE POINTED IN STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS DIRECTION, ‚ÄÚFIRED IN THE AIR ON PURPOSE ‚Ä¶ INTENTIONALLY.‚Ä¶ THIS IS AN INSULT AGAIN.‚Ä¶ HE WANTS TO MAKE THE DUEL IMPOSSIBLE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI HAVE THE RIGHT TO FIRE AS I LIKE SO LONG AS I KEEP THE RULES,‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH ASSERTED RESOLUTELY.

‚ÄÚNO, HE HASN‚ÄÔT! EXPLAIN IT TO HIM! EXPLAIN IT!‚ÄÙ CRIED GAGANOV.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT WITH NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH,‚ÄÙ PROCLAIMED KIRILLOV.

‚ÄÚWHY DOES HE SPARE ME?‚ÄÙ GAGANOV RAGED, NOT HEARING HIM. ‚ÄÚI DESPISE HIS MERCY.‚Ä¶ I SPIT ON IT.‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI GIVE YOU MY WORD THAT I DID NOT INTEND TO INSULT YOU,‚ÄÙ CRIED NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH IMPATIENTLY. ‚ÄÚI SHOT HIGH BECAUSE I DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO KILL ANYONE ELSE, EITHER YOU OR ANYONE ELSE. IT‚ÄÔS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU PERSONALLY. IT‚ÄÔS TRUE THAT I DON‚ÄÔT CONSIDER MYSELF INSULTED, AND I‚ÄÔM SORRY THAT ANGERS YOU. BUT I DON‚ÄÔT ALLOW ANY ONE TO INTERFERE WITH MY RIGHTS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF HE‚ÄÔS SO AFRAID OF BLOODSHED, ASK HIM WHY HE CHALLENGED ME,‚ÄÙ YELLED GAGANOV, STILL ADDRESSING MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH.

‚ÄÚHOW COULD HE HELP CHALLENGING YOU?‚ÄÙ SAID KIRILLOV, INTERVENING. ‚ÄÚYOU WOULDN‚ÄÔT LISTEN TO ANYTHING. HOW WAS ONE TO GET RID OF YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL ONLY MENTION ONE THING,‚ÄÙ OBSERVED MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, PONDERING THE MATTER WITH PAINFUL EFFORT. ‚ÄÚIF A COMBATANT DECLARES BEFOREHAND THAT HE WILL FIRE IN THE AIR THE DUEL CERTAINLY CANNOT GO ON ‚Ä¶ FOR OBVIOUS AND ‚Ä¶ DELICATE REASONS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI HAVEN‚ÄÔT DECLARED THAT I‚ÄÔLL FIRE IN THE AIR EVERY TIME,‚ÄÙ CRIED STAVROGIN, LOSING ALL PATIENCE. ‚ÄÚYOU DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT‚ÄÔS IN MY MIND OR HOW I INTEND TO FIRE AGAIN.‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔM NOT RESTRICTING THE DUEL AT ALL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIN THAT CASE THE ENCOUNTER CAN GO ON,‚ÄÙ SAID MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH TO GAGANOV.

‚ÄÚGENTLEMEN, TAKE YOUR PLACES,‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV COMMANDED. AGAIN THEY ADVANCED, AGAIN GAGANOV MISSED AND STAVROGIN FIRED INTO THE AIR. THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A DISPUTE AS TO HIS FIRING INTO THE AIR. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH MIGHT HAVE FLATLY DECLARED THAT HE‚ÄÔD FIRED PROPERLY, IF HE HAD NOT ADMITTED THAT HE HAD MISSED INTENTIONALLY. HE DID NOT AIM STRAIGHT AT THE SKY OR AT THE TREES, BUT SEEMED TO AIM AT HIS ADVERSARY, THOUGH AS HE POINTED THE PISTOL THE BULLET FLEW A YARD ABOVE HIS HAT. THE SECOND TIME THE SHOT WAS EVEN LOWER, EVEN LESS LIKE AN INTENTIONAL MISS. NOTHING WOULD HAVE CONVINCED GAGANOV NOW.

‚ÄÚAGAIN!‚ÄÙ HE MUTTERED, GRINDING HIS TEETH. ‚ÄÚNO MATTER! I‚ÄÔVE BEEN CHALLENGED AND I‚ÄÔLL MAKE USE OF MY RIGHTS. I‚ÄÔLL FIRE A THIRD TIME ‚Ä¶ WHATEVER HAPPENS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU HAVE FULL RIGHT TO DO SO,‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV RAPPED OUT. MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH SAID NOTHING. THE OPPONENTS WERE PLACED A THIRD TIME, THE SIGNAL WAS GIVEN. THIS TIME GAGANOV WENT RIGHT UP TO THE BARRIER, AND BEGAN FROM THERE TAKING AIM, AT A DISTANCE OF TWELVE PACES. HIS HAND WAS TREMBLING TOO MUCH TO TAKE GOOD AIM. STAVROGIN STOOD WITH HIS PISTOL LOWERED AND AWAITED HIS SHOT WITHOUT MOVING.

‚ÄÚTOO LONG; YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN AIMING TOO LONG!‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV SHOUTED IMPETUOUSLY. ‚ÄÚFIRE! FIRE!‚ÄÙ

BUT THE SHOT RANG OUT, AND THIS TIME STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS WHITE BEAVER HAT FLEW OFF. THE AIM HAD BEEN FAIRLY CORRECT. THE CROWN OF THE HAT WAS PIERCED VERY LOW DOWN; A QUARTER OF AN INCH LOWER AND ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER. KIRILLOV PICKED UP THE HAT AND HANDED IT TO NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH.

‚ÄÚFIRE; DON‚ÄÔT DETAIN YOUR ADVERSARY!‚ÄÙ CRIED MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH IN EXTREME AGITATION, SEEING THAT STAVROGIN SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN TO FIRE, AND WAS EXAMINING THE HAT WITH KIRILLOV. STAVROGIN STARTED, LOOKED AT GAGANOV, TURNED ROUND AND THIS TIME, WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST REGARD FOR PUNCTILIO, FIRED TO ONE SIDE, INTO THE COPSE. THE DUEL WAS OVER. GAGANOV STOOD AS THOUGH OVERWHELMED. MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH WENT UP AND BEGAN SAYING SOMETHING TO HIM, BUT HE DID NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND. KIRILLOV TOOK OFF HIS HAT AS HE WENT AWAY, AND NODDED TO MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH. BUT STAVROGIN FORGOT HIS FORMER POLITENESS. WHEN HE HAD SHOT INTO THE COPSE HE DID NOT EVEN TURN TOWARDS THE BARRIER. HE HANDED HIS PISTOL TO KIRILLOV AND HASTENED TOWARDS THE HORSES. HIS FACE LOOKED ANGRY; HE DID NOT SPEAK. KIRILLOV, TOO, WAS SILENT. THEY GOT ON THEIR HORSES AND SET OFF AT A GALLOP.

III

‚ÄÚWHY DON‚ÄÔT YOU SPEAK?‚ÄÙ HE CALLED IMPATIENTLY TO KIRILLOV, WHEN THEY WERE NOT FAR FROM HOME.

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU WANT?‚ÄÙ REPLIED THE LATTER, ALMOST SLIPPING OFF HIS HORSE, WHICH WAS REARING.

STAVROGIN RESTRAINED HIMSELF.

‚ÄÚI DIDN‚ÄÔT MEAN TO INSULT THAT ‚Ä¶ FOOL, AND I‚ÄÔVE INSULTED HIM AGAIN,‚ÄÙ HE SAID QUIETLY.

‚ÄÚYES, YOU‚ÄÔVE INSULTED HIM AGAIN,‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV JERKED OUT, ‚ÄÚAND BESIDES, HE‚ÄÔS NOT A FOOL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE DONE ALL I CAN, ANYWAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT OUGHT I TO HAVE DONE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOT HAVE CHALLENGED HIM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚACCEPT ANOTHER BLOW IN THE FACE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, ACCEPT ANOTHER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI CAN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING NOW,‚ÄÙ SAID STAVROGIN WRATHFULLY. ‚ÄÚWHY DOES EVERY ONE EXPECT OF ME SOMETHING NOT EXPECTED FROM ANYONE ELSE? WHY AM I TO PUT UP WITH WHAT NO ONE ELSE PUTS UP WITH, AND UNDERTAKE BURDENS NO ONE ELSE CAN BEAR?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI THOUGHT YOU WERE SEEKING A BURDEN YOURSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SEEK A BURDEN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE ‚Ä¶ SEEN THAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIS IT SO NOTICEABLE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES.‚ÄÙ

THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT. STAVROGIN HAD A VERY PREOCCUPIED FACE. HE WAS ALMOST IMPRESSED.

‚ÄÚI DIDN‚ÄÔT AIM BECAUSE I DIDN‚ÄÔT WANT TO KILL ANYONE. THERE WAS NOTHING MORE IN IT, I ASSURE YOU,‚ÄÙ HE SAID HURRIEDLY, AND WITH AGITATION, AS THOUGH JUSTIFYING HIMSELF.

‚ÄÚYOU OUGHT NOT TO HAVE OFFENDED HIM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT OUGHT I TO HAVE DONE THEN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU OUGHT TO HAVE KILLED HIM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚARE YOU SORRY I DIDN‚ÄÔT KILL HIM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM NOT SORRY FOR ANYTHING. I THOUGHT YOU REALLY MEANT TO KILL HIM. YOU DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT YOU‚ÄÔRE SEEKING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SEEK A BURDEN,‚ÄÙ LAUGHED STAVROGIN.

‚ÄÚIF YOU DIDN‚ÄÔT WANT BLOOD YOURSELF, WHY DID YOU GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO KILL YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF I HADN‚ÄÔT CHALLENGED HIM, HE‚ÄÔD HAVE KILLED ME SIMPLY, WITHOUT A DUEL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS NOT YOUR AFFAIR. PERHAPS HE WOULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE KILLED YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚONLY HAVE BEATEN ME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS NOT YOUR BUSINESS. BEAR YOUR BURDEN. OR ELSE THERE‚ÄÔS NO MERIT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHANG YOUR MERIT. I DON‚ÄÔT SEEK ANYONE‚ÄÔS APPROBATION.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI THOUGHT YOU WERE SEEKING IT,‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV COMMENTED WITH TERRIBLE UNCONCERN.

THEY RODE INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE HOUSE.

‚ÄÚDO YOU CARE TO COME IN?‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH.

‚ÄÚNO; I‚ÄÔM GOING HOME. GOOD-BYE.‚ÄÙ

HE GOT OFF THE HORSE AND TOOK HIS BOX OF PISTOLS UNDER HIS ARM.

‚ÄÚANYWAY, YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT ANGRY WITH ME?‚ÄÙ SAID STAVROGIN, HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO HIM.

‚ÄÚNOT IN THE LEAST,‚ÄÙ SAID KIRILLOV, TURNING ROUND TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM. ‚ÄÚIF MY BURDEN‚ÄÔS LIGHT IT‚ÄÔS BECAUSE IT‚ÄÔS FROM NATURE; PERHAPS YOUR BURDEN‚ÄÔS HEAVIER BECAUSE THAT‚ÄÔS YOUR NATURE. THERE‚ÄÔS NO NEED TO BE MUCH ASHAMED; ONLY A LITTLE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNOW I‚ÄÔM A WORTHLESS CHARACTER, AND I DON‚ÄÔT PRETEND TO BE A STRONG ONE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔD BETTER NOT; YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT A STRONG PERSON. COME AND HAVE TEA.‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WENT INTO THE HOUSE, GREATLY PERTURBED.

IV

HE LEARNED AT ONCE FROM ALEXEY YEGORYTCH THAT VARVARA PETROVNA HAD BEEN VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAD GONE OUT FOR A RIDE‚ÄÎTHE FIRST TIME HE HAD LEFT THE HOUSE AFTER EIGHT DAYS‚ÄÔ ILLNESS. SHE HAD ORDERED THE CARRIAGE, AND HAD DRIVEN OUT ALONE FOR A BREATH OF FRESH AIR ‚ÄÚACCORDING TO THE HABIT OF THE PAST, AS SHE HAD FORGOTTEN FOR THE LAST EIGHT DAYS WHAT IT MEANT TO BREATHE FRESH AIR.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚALONE, OR WITH DARYA PAVLOVNA?‚ÄÙ NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN WITH A RAPID QUESTION, AND HE SCOWLED WHEN HE HEARD THAT DARYA PAVLOVNA ‚ÄÚHAD DECLINED TO GO ABROAD ON ACCOUNT OF INDISPOSITION AND WAS IN HER ROOMS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLISTEN, OLD MAN,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, AS THOUGH SUDDENLY MAKING UP HIS MIND. ‚ÄÚKEEP WATCH OVER HER ALL TO-DAY, AND IF YOU NOTICE HER COMING TO ME, STOP HER AT ONCE, AND TELL HER THAT I CAN‚ÄÔT SEE HER FOR A FEW DAYS AT LEAST ‚Ä¶ THAT I ASK HER NOT TO COME MYSELF.‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔLL LET HER KNOW MYSELF, WHEN THE TIME COMES. DO YOU HEAR?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL TELL HER, SIR,‚ÄÙ SAID ALEXEY YEGORYTCH, WITH DISTRESS IN HIS VOICE, DROPPING HIS EYES.

‚ÄÚNOT TILL YOU SEE CLEARLY SHE‚ÄÔS MEANING TO COME AND SEE ME OF HERSELF, THOUGH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT BE AFRAID, SIR, THERE SHALL BE NO MISTAKE. YOUR INTERVIEWS HAVE ALL PASSED THROUGH ME, HITHERTO. YOU‚ÄÔVE ALWAYS TURNED TO ME FOR HELP.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNOW. NOT TILL SHE COMES OF HERSELF, ANYWAY. BRING ME SOME TEA, IF YOU CAN, AT ONCE.‚ÄÙ

THE OLD MAN HAD HARDLY GONE OUT, WHEN ALMOST AT THE SAME INSTANT THE DOOR REOPENED, AND DARYA PAVLOVNA APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY. HER EYES WERE TRANQUIL, THOUGH HER FACE WAS PALE.

‚ÄÚWHERE HAVE YOU COME FROM?‚ÄÙ EXCLAIMED STAVROGIN.

‚ÄÚI WAS STANDING THERE, AND WAITING FOR HIM TO GO OUT, TO COME IN TO YOU. I HEARD THE ORDER YOU GAVE HIM, AND WHEN HE CAME OUT JUST NOW I HID ROUND THE CORNER, ON THE RIGHT, AND HE DIDN‚ÄÔT NOTICE ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE LONG MEANT TO BREAK OFF WITH YOU, DASHA ‚Ä¶ FOR A WHILE ‚Ä¶ FOR THE PRESENT. I COULDN‚ÄÔT SEE YOU LAST NIGHT, IN SPITE OF YOUR NOTE. I MEANT TO WRITE TO YOU MYSELF, BUT I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HOW TO WRITE,‚ÄÙ HE ADDED WITH VEXATION, ALMOST AS THOUGH WITH DISGUST.

‚ÄÚI THOUGHT MYSELF THAT WE MUST BREAK IT OFF. VARVARA PETROVNA IS TOO SUSPICIOUS OF OUR RELATIONS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, LET HER BE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSHE MUSTN‚ÄÔT BE WORRIED. SO NOW WE PART TILL THE END COMES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU STILL INSIST ON EXPECTING THE END?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, I‚ÄÔM SURE OF IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT NOTHING IN THE WORLD EVER HAS AN END.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHIS WILL HAVE AN END. THEN CALL ME. I‚ÄÔLL COME. NOW, GOOD-BYE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND WHAT SORT OF END WILL IT BE?‚ÄÙ SMILED NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE NOT WOUNDED, AND ‚Ä¶ HAVE NOT SHED BLOOD?‚ÄÙ SHE ASKED, NOT ANSWERING HIS QUESTION.

‚ÄÚIT WAS STUPID. I DIDN‚ÄÔT KILL ANYONE. DON‚ÄÔT BE UNEASY. HOWEVER, YOU‚ÄÔLL HEAR ALL ABOUT IT TO-DAY FROM EVERY ONE. I‚ÄÔM NOT QUITE WELL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM GOING. THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE MARRIAGE WON‚ÄÔT BE TO-DAY?‚ÄÙ SHE ADDED IRRESOLUTELY.

‚ÄÚIT WON‚ÄÔT BE TO-DAY, AND IT WON‚ÄÔT BE TO-MORROW. I CAN‚ÄÔT SAY ABOUT THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW. PERHAPS WE SHALL ALL BE DEAD, AND SO MUCH THE BETTER. LEAVE ME ALONE, LEAVE ME ALONE, DO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU WON‚ÄÔT RUIN THAT OTHER ‚Ä¶ MAD GIRL?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WON‚ÄÔT RUIN EITHER OF THE MAD CREATURES. IT SEEMS TO BE THE SANE I‚ÄÔM RUINING. I‚ÄÔM SO VILE AND LOATHSOME, DASHA, THAT I MIGHT REALLY SEND FOR YOU, ‚ÄÒAT THE LATTER END,‚ÄÔ AS YOU SAY. AND IN SPITE OF YOUR SANITY YOU‚ÄÔLL COME. WHY WILL YOU BE YOUR OWN RUIN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNOW THAT AT THE END I SHALL BE THE ONLY ONE LEFT YOU, AND ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔM WAITING FOR THAT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND WHAT IF I DON‚ÄÔT SEND FOR YOU AFTER ALL, BUT RUN AWAY FROM YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT CAN‚ÄÔT BE. YOU WILL SEND FOR ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHERE‚ÄÔS A GREAT DEAL OF CONTEMPT FOR ME IN THAT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU KNOW THAT THERE‚ÄÔS NOT ONLY CONTEMPT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEN THERE IS CONTEMPT, ANYWAY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI USED THE WRONG WORD. GOD IS MY WITNESS, IT‚ÄÔS MY GREATEST WISH THAT YOU MAY NEVER HAVE NEED OF ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚONE PHRASE IS AS GOOD AS ANOTHER. I SHOULD ALSO HAVE WISHED NOT TO HAVE RUINED YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU CAN NEVER, ANYHOW, BE MY RUIN; AND YOU KNOW THAT YOURSELF, BETTER THAN ANYONE,‚ÄÙ DARYA PAVLOVNA SAID, RAPIDLY AND RESOLUTELY. ‚ÄÚIF I DON‚ÄÔT COME TO YOU I SHALL BE A SISTER OF MERCY, A NURSE, SHALL WAIT UPON THE SICK, OR GO SELLING THE GOSPEL. I‚ÄÔVE MADE UP MY MIND TO THAT. I CANNOT BE ANYONE‚ÄÔS WIFE. I CAN‚ÄÔT LIVE IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS, EITHER. THAT‚ÄÔS NOT WHAT I WANT.‚Ä¶ YOU KNOW ALL THAT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, I NEVER COULD TELL WHAT YOU WANT. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU‚ÄÔRE INTERESTED IN ME, AS SOME VETERAN NURSES GET SPECIALLY INTERESTED IN SOME PARTICULAR INVALID IN COMPARISON WITH THE OTHERS, OR STILL MORE, LIKE SOME PIOUS OLD WOMEN WHO FREQUENT FUNERALS AND FIND ONE CORPSE MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN ANOTHER. WHY DO YOU LOOK AT ME SO STRANGELY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚARE YOU VERY ILL?‚ÄÙ SHE ASKED SYMPATHETICALLY, LOOKING AT HIM IN A PECULIAR WAY. ‚ÄÚGOOD HEAVENS! AND THIS MAN WANTS TO DO WITHOUT ME!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLISTEN, DASHA, NOW I‚ÄÔM ALWAYS SEEING PHANTOMS. ONE DEVIL OFFERED ME YESTERDAY, ON THE BRIDGE, TO MURDER LEBYADKIN AND MARYA TIMOFYEVNA, TO SETTLE THE MARRIAGE DIFFICULTY, AND TO COVER UP ALL TRACES. HE ASKED ME TO GIVE HIM THREE ROUBLES ON ACCOUNT, BUT GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WHOLE OPERATION WOULDN‚ÄÔT COST LESS THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED. WASN‚ÄÔT HE A CALCULATING DEVIL! A REGULAR SHOPKEEPER. HA HA!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT YOU‚ÄÔRE FULLY CONVINCED THAT IT WAS AN HALLUCINATION?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, NO; NOT A BIT AN HALLUCINATION! IT WAS SIMPLY FEDKA THE CONVICT, THE ROBBER WHO ESCAPED FROM PRISON. BUT THAT‚ÄÔS NOT THE POINT. WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE I DID! I GAVE HIM ALL I HAD, EVERYTHING IN MY PURSE, AND NOW HE‚ÄÔS SURE I‚ÄÔVE GIVEN HIM THAT ON ACCOUNT!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU MET HIM AT NIGHT, AND HE MADE SUCH A SUGGESTION? SURELY YOU MUST SEE THAT YOU‚ÄÔRE BEING CAUGHT IN THEIR NETS ON EVERY SIDE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, LET THEM BE. BUT YOU‚ÄÔVE GOT SOME QUESTION AT THE TIP OF YOUR TONGUE, YOU KNOW. I SEE IT BY YOUR EYES,‚ÄÙ HE ADDED WITH A RESENTFUL AND IRRITABLE SMILE.

DASHA WAS FRIGHTENED.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE NO QUESTION AT ALL, AND NO DOUBT WHATEVER; YOU‚ÄÔD BETTER BE QUIET!‚ÄÙ SHE CRIED IN DISMAY, AS THOUGH WAVING OFF HIS QUESTION.

‚ÄÚTHEN YOU‚ÄÔRE CONVINCED THAT I WON‚ÄÔT GO TO FEDKA‚ÄÔS LITTLE SHOP?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, GOD!‚ÄÙ SHE CRIED, CLASPING HER HANDS. ‚ÄÚWHY DO YOU TORTURE ME LIKE THIS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, FORGIVE ME MY STUPID JOKE. I MUST BE PICKING UP BAD MANNERS FROM THEM. DO YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE LAST NIGHT I FEEL AWFULLY INCLINED TO LAUGH, TO GO ON LAUGHING CONTINUALLY FOREVER SO LONG. IT‚ÄÔS AS THOUGH I MUST EXPLODE WITH LAUGHTER. IT‚ÄÔS LIKE AN ILLNESS.‚Ä¶ OH! MY MOTHER‚ÄÔS COMING IN. I ALWAYS KNOW BY THE RUMBLE WHEN HER CARRIAGE HAS STOPPED AT THE ENTRANCE.‚ÄÙ

DASHA SEIZED HIS HAND.

‚ÄÚGOD SAVE YOU FROM YOUR DEMON, AND ‚Ä¶ CALL ME, CALL ME QUICKLY!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH! A FINE DEMON! IT‚ÄÔS SIMPLY A LITTLE NASTY, SCROFULOUS IMP, WITH A COLD IN HIS HEAD, ONE OF THE UNSUCCESSFUL ONES. BUT YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU DON‚ÄÔT DARE TO SAY AGAIN, DASHA?‚ÄÙ

SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH PAIN AND REPROACH, AND TURNED TOWARDS THE DOOR.

‚ÄÚLISTEN,‚ÄÙ HE CALLED AFTER HER, WITH A MALIGNANT AND DISTORTED SMILE. ‚ÄÚIF ‚Ä¶ YES, IF, IN ONE WORD, IF ‚Ä¶ YOU UNDERSTAND, EVEN IF I DID GO TO THAT LITTLE SHOP, AND IF I CALLED YOU AFTER THAT‚ÄÎWOULD YOU COME THEN?‚ÄÙ

SHE WENT OUT, HIDING HER FACE IN HER HANDS, AND NEITHER TURNING NOR ANSWERING.

‚ÄÚSHE WILL COME EVEN AFTER THE SHOP,‚ÄÙ HE WHISPERED, THINKING A MOMENT, AND AN EXPRESSION OF SCORNFUL DISDAIN CAME INTO HIS FACE. ‚ÄÚA NURSE! H‚ÄÔM!‚Ä¶ BUT PERHAPS THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT I WANT.‚ÄÙ





CHAPTER IV. ALL IN EXPECTATION

I

THE IMPRESSION MADE ON THE WHOLE NEIGHBOURHOOD BY THE STORY OF THE DUEL, WHICH WAS RAPIDLY NOISED ABROAD, WAS PARTICULARLY REMARKABLE FROM THE UNANIMITY WITH WHICH EVERY ONE HASTENED TO TAKE UP THE CUDGELS FOR NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH. MANY OF HIS FORMER ENEMIES DECLARED THEMSELVES HIS FRIENDS. THE CHIEF REASON FOR THIS CHANGE OF FRONT IN PUBLIC OPINION WAS CHIEFLY DUE TO ONE PERSON, WHO HAD HITHERTO NOT EXPRESSED HER OPINION, BUT WHO NOW VERY DISTINCTLY UTTERED A FEW WORDS, WHICH AT ONCE GAVE THE EVENT A SIGNIFICANCE EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING TO THE VAST MAJORITY. THIS WAS HOW IT HAPPENED. ON THE DAY AFTER THE DUEL, ALL THE TOWN WAS ASSEMBLED AT THE MARSHAL OF NOBILITY‚ÄÔS IN HONOUR OF HIS WIFE‚ÄÔS NAMEDAY. YULIA MIHAILOVNA WAS PRESENT, OR, RATHER, PRESIDED, ACCOMPANIED BY LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA, RADIANT WITH BEAUTY AND PECULIAR GAIETY, WHICH STRUCK MANY OF OUR LADIES AT ONCE AS PARTICULARLY SUSPICIOUS AT THIS TIME. AND I MAY MENTION, BY THE WAY, HER ENGAGEMENT TO MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH WAS BY NOW AN ESTABLISHED FACT. TO A PLAYFUL QUESTION FROM A RETIRED GENERAL OF MUCH CONSEQUENCE, OF WHOM WE SHALL HAVE MORE TO SAY LATER, LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA FRANKLY REPLIED THAT EVENING THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED. AND ONLY IMAGINE, NOT ONE OF OUR LADIES WOULD BELIEVE IN HER ENGAGEMENT. THEY ALL PERSISTED IN ASSUMING A ROMANCE OF SOME SORT, SOME FATAL FAMILY SECRET, SOMETHING THAT HAD HAPPENED IN SWITZERLAND, AND FOR SOME REASON IMAGINED THAT YULIA MIHAILOVNA MUST HAVE HAD SOME HAND IN IT. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHY THESE RUMOURS, OR RATHER FANCIES, PERSISTED SO OBSTINATELY, AND WHY YULIA MIHAILOVNA WAS SO POSITIVELY CONNECTED WITH IT. AS SOON AS SHE CAME IN, ALL TURNED TO HER WITH STRANGE LOOKS, BRIMFUL OF EXPECTATION. IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT OWING TO THE FRESHNESS OF THE EVENT, AND CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES ACCOMPANYING IT, AT THE PARTY PEOPLE TALKED OF IT WITH SOME CIRCUMSPECTION, IN UNDERTONES. BESIDES, NOTHING YET WAS KNOWN OF THE LINE TAKEN BY THE AUTHORITIES. AS FAR AS WAS KNOWN, NEITHER OF THE COMBATANTS HAD BEEN TROUBLED BY THE POLICE. EVERY ONE KNEW, FOR INSTANCE, THAT GAGANOV HAD SET OFF HOME EARLY IN THE MORNING TO DUHOVO, WITHOUT BEING HINDERED. MEANWHILE, OF COURSE, ALL WERE EAGER FOR SOMEONE TO BE THE FIRST TO SPEAK OF IT ALOUD, AND SO TO OPEN THE DOOR TO THE GENERAL IMPATIENCE. THEY RESTED THEIR HOPES ON THE GENERAL ABOVE-MENTIONED, AND THEY WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED.

THIS GENERAL, A LANDOWNER, THOUGH NOT A WEALTHY ONE, WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPOSING MEMBERS OF OUR CLUB, AND A MAN OF AN ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE TURN OF MIND. HE FLIRTED IN THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY WITH THE YOUNG LADIES, AND WAS PARTICULARLY FOND, IN LARGE ASSEMBLIES, OF SPEAKING ALOUD WITH ALL THE WEIGHTINESS OF A GENERAL, ON SUBJECTS TO WHICH OTHERS WERE ALLUDING IN DISCREET WHISPERS. THIS WAS, SO TO SAY, HIS SPECIAL R√¥LE IN LOCAL SOCIETY. HE DRAWLED, TOO, AND SPOKE WITH PECULIAR SUAVITY, PROBABLY HAVING PICKED UP THE HABIT FROM RUSSIANS TRAVELLING ABROAD, OR FROM THOSE WEALTHY LANDOWNERS OF FORMER DAYS WHO HAD SUFFERED MOST FROM THE EMANCIPATION. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HAD OBSERVED THAT THE MORE COMPLETELY A LANDOWNER WAS RUINED, THE MORE SUAVELY HE LISPED AND DRAWLED HIS WORDS. HE DID, AS A FACT, LISP AND DRAWL HIMSELF, BUT WAS NOT AWARE OF IT IN HIMSELF.

THE GENERAL SPOKE LIKE A PERSON OF AUTHORITY. HE WAS, BESIDES, A DISTANT RELATION OF GAGANOV‚ÄÔS, THOUGH HE WAS ON BAD TERMS WITH HIM, AND EVEN ENGAGED IN LITIGATION WITH HIM. HE HAD, MOREOVER, IN THE PAST, FOUGHT TWO DUELS HIMSELF, AND HAD EVEN BEEN DEGRADED TO THE RANKS AND SENT TO THE CAUCASUS ON ACCOUNT OF ONE OF THEM. SOME MENTION WAS MADE OF VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS HAVING DRIVEN OUT THAT DAY AND THE DAY BEFORE, AFTER BEING KEPT INDOORS ‚ÄÚBY ILLNESS,‚ÄÙ THOUGH THE ALLUSION WAS NOT TO HER, BUT TO THE MARVELLOUS MATCHING OF HER FOUR GREY HORSES OF THE STAVROGINS‚ÄÔ OWN BREEDING. THE GENERAL SUDDENLY OBSERVED THAT HE HAD MET ‚ÄÚYOUNG STAVROGIN‚ÄÙ THAT DAY, ON HORSEBACK.‚Ä¶ EVERY ONE WAS INSTANTLY SILENT. THE GENERAL MUNCHED HIS LIPS, AND SUDDENLY PROCLAIMED, TWISTING IN HIS FINGERS HIS PRESENTATION GOLD SNUFF-BOX.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM SORRY I WASN‚ÄÔT HERE SOME YEARS AGO ‚Ä¶ I MEAN WHEN I WAS AT CARLSBAD ‚Ä¶ H‚ÄÔM! I‚ÄÔM VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN THAT YOUNG MAN ABOUT WHOM I HEARD SO MANY RUMOURS AT THAT TIME. H‚ÄÔM! AND, I SAY, IS IT TRUE THAT HE‚ÄÔS MAD? SOME ONE TOLD ME SO THEN. SUDDENLY I‚ÄÔM TOLD THAT HE HAS BEEN INSULTED BY SOME STUDENT HERE, IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS COUSINS, AND HE SLIPPED UNDER THE TABLE TO GET AWAY FROM HIM. AND YESTERDAY I HEARD FROM STEPAN VYSOTSKY THAT STAVROGIN HAD BEEN FIGHTING WITH GAGANOV. AND SIMPLY WITH THE GALLANT OBJECT OF OFFERING HIMSELF AS A TARGET TO AN INFURIATED MAN, JUST TO GET RID OF HIM. H‚ÄÔM! QUITE IN THE STYLE OF THE GUARDS OF THE TWENTIES. IS THERE ANY HOUSE WHERE HE VISITS HERE?‚ÄÙ

THE GENERAL PAUSED AS THOUGH EXPECTING AN ANSWER. A WAY HAD BEEN OPENED FOR THE PUBLIC IMPATIENCE TO EXPRESS ITSELF.

‚ÄÚWHAT COULD BE SIMPLER?‚ÄÙ CRIED YULIA MIHAILOVNA, RAISING HER VOICE, IRRITATED THAT ALL PRESENT HAD TURNED THEIR EYES UPON HER, AS THOUGH AT A WORD OF COMMAND. ‚ÄÚCAN ONE WONDER THAT STAVROGIN FOUGHT GAGANOV AND TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE STUDENT? HE COULDN‚ÄÔT CHALLENGE A MAN WHO USED TO BE HIS SERF!‚ÄÙ

A NOTEWORTHY SAYING! A CLEAR AND SIMPLE NOTION, YET IT HAD ENTERED NOBODY‚ÄÔS HEAD TILL THAT MOMENT. IT WAS A SAYING THAT HAD EXTRAORDINARY CONSEQUENCES. ALL SCANDAL AND GOSSIP, ALL THE PETTY TITTLE-TATTLE WAS THROWN INTO THE BACKGROUND, ANOTHER SIGNIFICANCE HAD BEEN DETECTED. A NEW CHARACTER WAS REVEALED WHOM ALL HAD MISJUDGED; A CHARACTER, ALMOST IDEALLY SEVERE IN HIS STANDARDS. MORTALLY INSULTED BY A STUDENT, THAT IS, AN EDUCATED MAN, NO LONGER A SERF, HE DESPISED THE AFFRONT BECAUSE HIS ASSAILANT HAD ONCE BEEN HIS SERF. SOCIETY HAD GOSSIPED AND SLANDERED HIM; SHALLOW-MINDED PEOPLE HAD LOOKED WITH CONTEMPT ON A MAN WHO HAD BEEN STRUCK IN THE FACE. HE HAD DESPISED A PUBLIC OPINION, WHICH HAD NOT RISEN TO THE LEVEL OF THE HIGHEST STANDARDS, THOUGH IT DISCUSSED THEM.

‚ÄÚAND, MEANTIME, YOU AND I, IVAN ALEXANDROVITCH, SIT AND DISCUSS THE CORRECT STANDARDS,‚ÄÙ ONE OLD CLUB MEMBER OBSERVED TO ANOTHER, WITH A WARM AND GENEROUS GLOW OF SELF-REPROACH.

‚ÄÚYES, PYOTR MIHAILOVITCH, YES,‚ÄÙ THE OTHER CHIMED IN WITH ZEST, ‚ÄÚTALK OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS NOT A QUESTION OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION,‚ÄÙ OBSERVED A THIRD, PUTTING IN HIS SPOKE, ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE YOUNGER GENERATION; HE‚ÄÔS A STAR, NOT ONE OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION; THAT‚ÄÔS THE WAY TO LOOK AT IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND IT‚ÄÔS JUST THAT SORT WE NEED; THEY‚ÄÔRE RARE PEOPLE.‚ÄÙ THE CHIEF POINT IN ALL THIS WAS THAT THE ‚ÄÚNEW MAN,‚ÄÙ BESIDES SHOWING HIMSELF AN UNMISTAKABLE NOBLEMAN, WAS THE WEALTHIEST LANDOWNER IN THE PROVINCE, AND WAS, THEREFORE, BOUND TO BE A LEADING MAN WHO COULD BE OF ASSISTANCE. I‚ÄÔVE ALREADY ALLUDED IN PASSING TO THE ATTITUDE OF THE LANDOWNERS OF OUR PROVINCE. PEOPLE WERE ENTHUSIASTIC:

‚ÄÚHE DIDN‚ÄÔT MERELY REFRAIN FROM CHALLENGING THE STUDENT. HE PUT HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM, NOTE THAT PARTICULARLY, YOUR EXCELLENCY,‚ÄÙ SOMEBODY POINTED OUT.

‚ÄÚAND HE DIDN‚ÄÔT HAUL HIM UP BEFORE THE NEW LAW-COURTS, EITHER,‚ÄÙ ADDED ANOTHER.

‚ÄÚIN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT FOR A PERSONAL INSULT TO A NOBLEMAN HE‚ÄÔD HAVE GOT FIFTEEN ROUBLES DAMAGES! HE HE HE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, I‚ÄÔLL TELL YOU A SECRET ABOUT THE NEW COURTS,‚ÄÙ CRIED A THIRD, IN A FRENZY OF EXCITEMENT, ‚ÄÚIF ANYONE‚ÄÔS CAUGHT ROBBING OR SWINDLING AND CONVICTED, HE‚ÄÔD BETTER RUN HOME WHILE THERE‚ÄÔS YET TIME, AND MURDER HIS MOTHER. HE‚ÄÔLL BE ACQUITTED OF EVERYTHING AT ONCE, AND LADIES WILL WAVE THEIR BATISTE HANDKERCHIEFS FROM THE PLATFORM. IT‚ÄÔS THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS THE TRUTH. IT‚ÄÔS THE TRUTH!‚ÄÙ

THE INEVITABLE ANECDOTES FOLLOWED: NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH‚ÄÔS FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH COUNT K. WERE RECALLED. COUNT K.‚ÄÔS STERN AND INDEPENDENT ATTITUDE TO RECENT REFORMS WAS WELL KNOWN, AS WELL AS HIS REMARKABLE PUBLIC ACTIVITY, THOUGH THAT HAD SOMEWHAT FALLEN OFF OF LATE. AND NOW, SUDDENLY, EVERY ONE WAS POSITIVE THAT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS BETROTHED TO ONE OF THE COUNT‚ÄÔS DAUGHTERS, THOUGH NOTHING HAD GIVEN GROUNDS FOR SUCH A SUPPOSITION. AND AS FOR SOME WONDERFUL ADVENTURES IN SWITZERLAND WITH LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA, EVEN THE LADIES QUITE DROPPED ALL REFERENCE TO IT. I MUST MENTION, BY THE WAY, THAT THE DROZDOVS HAD BY THIS TIME SUCCEEDED IN PAYING ALL THE VISITS THEY HAD OMITTED AT FIRST. EVERY ONE NOW CONFIDENTLY CONSIDERED LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA A MOST ORDINARY GIRL, WHO PARADED HER DELICATE NERVES. HER FAINTING ON THE DAY OF NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH‚ÄÔS ARRIVAL WAS EXPLAINED NOW AS DUE TO HER TERROR AT THE STUDENT‚ÄÔS OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIOUR. THEY EVEN INCREASED THE PROSAICNESS OF THAT TO WHICH BEFORE THEY HAD STRIVEN TO GIVE SUCH A FANTASTIC COLOUR. AS FOR A LAME WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN TALKED OF, SHE WAS FORGOTTEN COMPLETELY. THEY WERE ASHAMED TO REMEMBER HER.

‚ÄÚAND IF THERE HAD BEEN A HUNDRED LAME GIRLS‚ÄÎWE‚ÄÔVE ALL BEEN YOUNG ONCE!‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH‚ÄÔS RESPECTFULNESS TO HIS MOTHER WAS ENLARGED UPON. VARIOUS VIRTUES WERE DISCOVERED IN HIM. PEOPLE TALKED WITH APPROBATION OF THE LEARNING HE HAD ACQUIRED IN THE FOUR YEARS HE HAD SPENT IN GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. GAGANOV‚ÄÔS CONDUCT WAS DECLARED UTTERLY TACTLESS: ‚ÄÚNOT KNOWING FRIEND FROM FOE.‚ÄÙ YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS KEEN INSIGHT WAS UNHESITATINGLY ADMITTED.

SO BY THE TIME NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH MADE HIS APPEARANCE AMONG THEM HE WAS RECEIVED BY EVERY ONE WITH NA√ØVE SOLEMNITY. IN ALL EYES FASTENED UPON HIM COULD BE READ EAGER ANTICIPATION. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH AT ONCE WRAPPED HIMSELF IN THE MOST AUSTERE SILENCE, WHICH, OF COURSE, GRATIFIED EVERY ONE MUCH MORE THAN IF HE HAD TALKED TILL DOOMSDAY. IN A WORD, HE WAS A SUCCESS, HE WAS THE FASHION. IF ONCE ONE HAS FIGURED IN PROVINCIAL SOCIETY, THERE‚ÄÔS NO RETREATING INTO THE BACKGROUND. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH BEGAN TO FULFIL ALL HIS SOCIAL DUTIES IN THE PROVINCE PUNCTILIOUSLY AS BEFORE. HE WAS NOT FOUND CHEERFUL COMPANY: ‚ÄÚA MAN WHO HAS SEEN SUFFERING; A MAN NOT LIKE OTHER PEOPLE; HE HAS SOMETHING TO BE MELANCHOLY ABOUT.‚ÄÙ EVEN THE PRIDE AND DISDAINFUL ALOOFNESS FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN SO DETESTED FOUR YEARS BEFORE WAS NOW LIKED AND RESPECTED.

VARVARA PETROVNA WAS TRIUMPHANT. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHETHER SHE GRIEVED MUCH OVER THE SHATTERING OF HER DREAMS CONCERNING LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA. FAMILY PRIDE, OF COURSE, HELPED HER TO GET OVER IT. ONE THING WAS STRANGE: VARVARA PETROVNA WAS SUDDENLY CONVINCED THAT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH REALLY HAD ‚ÄÚMADE HIS CHOICE‚ÄÙ AT COUNT K.‚ÄÔS. AND WHAT WAS STRANGEST OF ALL, SHE WAS LED TO BELIEVE IT BY RUMOURS WHICH REACHED HER ON NO BETTER AUTHORITY THAN OTHER PEOPLE. SHE WAS AFRAID TO ASK NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH A DIRECT QUESTION. TWO OR THREE TIMES, HOWEVER, SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SLYLY AND GOOD-HUMOUREDLY REPROACHING HIM FOR NOT BEING OPEN WITH HER. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SMILED AND REMAINED SILENT. THE SILENCE WAS TAKEN AS A SIGN OF ASSENT. AND YET, ALL THE TIME SHE NEVER FORGOT THE CRIPPLE. THE THOUGHT OF HER LAY LIKE A STONE ON HER HEART, A NIGHTMARE, SHE WAS TORTURED BY STRANGE MISGIVINGS AND SURMISES, AND ALL THIS AT THE SAME TIME AS SHE DREAMED OF COUNT K.‚ÄÔS DAUGHTERS. BUT OF THIS WE SHALL SPEAK LATER. VARVARA PETROVNA BEGAN AGAIN, OF COURSE, TO BE TREATED WITH EXTREME DEFERENCE AND RESPECT IN SOCIETY, BUT SHE TOOK LITTLE ADVANTAGE OF IT AND WENT OUT RARELY.

SHE DID, HOWEVER, PAY A VISIT OF CEREMONY TO THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE. OF COURSE, NO ONE HAD BEEN MORE CHARMED AND DELIGHTED BY YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS WORDS SPOKEN AT THE MARSHAL‚ÄÔS SOIR√©E THAN SHE. THEY LIFTED A LOAD OF CARE OFF HER HEART, AND HAD AT ONCE RELIEVED MUCH OF THE DISTRESS SHE HAD BEEN SUFFERING SINCE THAT LUCKLESS SUNDAY.

‚ÄÚI MISUNDERSTOOD THAT WOMAN,‚ÄÙ SHE DECLARED, AND WITH HER CHARACTERISTIC IMPULSIVENESS SHE FRANKLY TOLD YULIA MIHAILOVNA THAT SHE HAD COME TO THANK HER. YULIA MIHAILOVNA WAS FLATTERED, BUT SHE BEHAVED WITH DIGNITY. SHE WAS BEGINNING ABOUT THIS TIME TO BE VERY CONSCIOUS OF HER OWN IMPORTANCE, TOO MUCH SO, IN FACT. SHE ANNOUNCED, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION, THAT SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH AS A LEADING MAN OR A SAVANT.

‚ÄÚI KNOW YOUNG VERHOVENSKY, OF COURSE, AND MAKE MUCH OF HIM. HE‚ÄÔS IMPRUDENT, BUT THEN HE‚ÄÔS YOUNG; HE‚ÄÔS THOROUGHLY WELL-INFORMED, THOUGH. HE‚ÄÔS NOT AN OUT-OF-DATE, OLD-FASHIONED CRITIC, ANYWAY.‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA HASTENED TO OBSERVE THAT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HAD NEVER BEEN A CRITIC, BUT HAD, ON THE CONTRARY, SPENT ALL HIS LIFE IN HER HOUSE. HE WAS RENOWNED THROUGH CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS EARLY CAREER, ‚ÄÚONLY TOO WELL KNOWN TO THE WHOLE WORLD,‚ÄÙ AND OF LATE FOR HIS RESEARCHES IN SPANISH HISTORY. NOW HE INTENDED TO WRITE ALSO ON THE POSITION OF MODERN GERMAN UNIVERSITIES, AND, SHE BELIEVED, SOMETHING ABOUT THE DRESDEN MADONNA TOO. IN SHORT, VARVARA PETROVNA REFUSED TO SURRENDER STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH TO THE TENDER MERCIES OF YULIA MIHAILOVNA.

‚ÄÚTHE DRESDEN MADONNA? YOU MEAN THE SISTINE MADONNA? CH√®RE VARVARA PETROVNA, I SPENT TWO HOURS SITTING BEFORE THAT PICTURE AND CAME AWAY UTTERLY DISILLUSIONED. I COULD MAKE NOTHING OF IT AND WAS IN COMPLETE AMAZEMENT. KARMAZINOV, TOO, SAYS IT‚ÄÔS HARD TO UNDERSTAND IT. THEY ALL SEE NOTHING IN IT NOW, RUSSIANS AND ENGLISH ALIKE. ALL ITS FAME IS JUST THE TALK OF THE LAST GENERATION.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFASHIONS ARE CHANGED THEN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT I THINK IS THAT ONE MUSTN‚ÄÔT DESPISE OUR YOUNGER GENERATION EITHER. THEY CRY OUT THAT THEY‚ÄÔRE COMMUNISTS, BUT WHAT I SAY IS THAT WE MUST APPRECIATE THEM AND MUSTN‚ÄÔT BE HARD ON THEM. I READ EVERYTHING NOW‚ÄÎTHE PAPERS, COMMUNISM, THE NATURAL SCIENCES‚ÄÎI GET EVERYTHING BECAUSE, AFTER ALL, ONE MUST KNOW WHERE ONE‚ÄÔS LIVING AND WITH WHOM ONE HAS TO DO. ONE MUSTN‚ÄÔT SPEND ONE‚ÄÔS WHOLE LIFE ON THE HEIGHTS OF ONE‚ÄÔS OWN FANCY. I‚ÄÔVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION, AND ADOPTED IT AS A PRINCIPLE, THAT ONE MUST BE KIND TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND SO KEEP THEM FROM THE BRINK. BELIEVE ME, VARVARA PETROVNA, THAT NONE BUT WE WHO MAKE UP GOOD SOCIETY CAN BY OUR KINDNESS AND GOOD INFLUENCE KEEP THEM FROM THE ABYSS TOWARDS WHICH THEY ARE BROUGHT BY THE INTOLERANCE OF ALL THESE OLD MEN. I AM GLAD THOUGH TO LEARN FROM YOU ABOUT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. YOU SUGGEST AN IDEA TO ME: HE MAY BE USEFUL AT OUR LITERARY MATIN√©E, YOU KNOW I‚ÄÔM ARRANGING FOR A WHOLE DAY OF FESTIVITIES, A SUBSCRIPTION ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE POOR GOVERNESSES OF OUR PROVINCE. THEY ARE SCATTERED ABOUT RUSSIA; IN OUR DISTRICT ALONE WE CAN RECKON UP SIX OF THEM. BESIDES THAT, THERE ARE TWO GIRLS IN THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE, TWO ARE BEING TRAINED IN THE ACADEMY, THE REST WOULD LIKE TO BE BUT HAVE NOT THE MEANS. THE RUSSIAN WOMAN‚ÄÔS FATE IS A TERRIBLE ONE, VARVARA PETROVNA! IT‚ÄÔS OUT OF THAT THEY‚ÄÔRE MAKING THE UNIVERSITY QUESTION NOW, AND THERE‚ÄÔS EVEN BEEN A MEETING OF THE IMPERIAL COUNCIL ABOUT IT. IN THIS STRANGE RUSSIA OF OURS ONE CAN DO ANYTHING ONE LIKES; AND THAT, AGAIN, IS WHY IT‚ÄÔS ONLY BY THE KINDNESS AND THE DIRECT WARM SYMPATHY OF ALL THE BETTER CLASSES THAT WE CAN DIRECT THIS GREAT COMMON CAUSE IN THE TRUE PATH. OH, HEAVENS, HAVE WE MANY NOBLE PERSONALITIES AMONG US! THERE ARE SOME, OF COURSE, BUT THEY ARE SCATTERED FAR AND WIDE. LET US UNITE AND WE SHALL BE STRONGER. IN ONE WORD, I SHALL FIRST HAVE A LITERARY MATIN√©E, THEN A LIGHT LUNCHEON, THEN AN INTERVAL, AND IN THE EVENING A BALL. WE MEANT TO BEGIN THE EVENING BY LIVING PICTURES, BUT IT WOULD INVOLVE A GREAT DEAL OF EXPENSE, AND SO, TO PLEASE THE PUBLIC, THERE WILL BE ONE OR TWO QUADRILLES IN MASKS AND FANCY DRESSES, REPRESENTING WELL-KNOWN LITERARY SCHOOLS. THIS HUMOROUS IDEA WAS SUGGESTED BY KARMAZINOV. HE HAS BEEN A GREAT HELP TO ME. DO YOU KNOW HE‚ÄÔS GOING TO READ US THE LAST THING HE‚ÄÔS WRITTEN, WHICH NO ONE HAS SEEN YET. HE IS LAYING DOWN THE PEN, AND WILL WRITE NO MORE. THIS LAST ESSAY IS HIS FAREWELL TO THE PUBLIC. IT‚ÄÔS A CHARMING LITTLE THING CALLED ‚ÄÒMERCI.‚ÄÔ THE TITLE IS FRENCH; HE THINKS THAT MORE AMUSING AND EVEN SUBTLER. I DO, TOO. IN FACT I ADVISED IT. I THINK STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH MIGHT READ US SOMETHING TOO, IF IT WERE QUITE SHORT AND ‚Ä¶ NOT SO VERY LEARNED. I BELIEVE PYOTR STEPANOVITCH AND SOME ONE ELSE TOO WILL READ SOMETHING. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SHALL RUN ROUND TO YOU AND TELL YOU THE PROGRAMME. BETTER STILL, LET ME BRING IT TO YOU MYSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚALLOW ME TO PUT MY NAME DOWN IN YOUR SUBSCRIPTION LIST TOO. I‚ÄÔLL TELL STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH AND WILL BEG HIM TO CONSENT.‚ÄÙ

VARVARA PETROVNA RETURNED HOME COMPLETELY FASCINATED. SHE WAS READY TO STAND UP FOR YULIA MIHAILOVNA THROUGH THICK AND THIN, AND FOR SOME REASON WAS ALREADY QUITE PUT OUT WITH STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, WHILE HE, POOR MAN, SAT AT HOME, ALL UNCONSCIOUS.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM IN LOVE WITH HER. I CAN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND HOW I COULD BE SO MISTAKEN IN THAT WOMAN,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID TO NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH AND PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WHO DROPPED IN THAT EVENING.

‚ÄÚBUT YOU MUST MAKE PEACE WITH THE OLD MAN ALL THE SAME,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SUBMITTED. ‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS IN DESPAIR. YOU‚ÄÔVE QUITE SENT HIM TO COVENTRY. YESTERDAY HE MET YOUR CARRIAGE AND BOWED, AND YOU TURNED AWAY. WE‚ÄÔLL TROT HIM OUT, YOU KNOW; I‚ÄÔM RECKONING ON HIM FOR SOMETHING, AND HE MAY STILL BE USEFUL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, HE‚ÄÔLL READ SOMETHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT MEAN ONLY THAT. AND I WAS MEANING TO DROP IN ON HIM TO-DAY. SO SHALL I TELL HIM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF YOU LIKE. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW, THOUGH, HOW YOU‚ÄÔLL ARRANGE IT,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID IRRESOLUTELY. ‚ÄÚI WAS MEANING TO HAVE A TALK WITH HIM MYSELF, AND WANTED TO FIX THE TIME AND PLACE.‚ÄÙ

SHE FROWNED.

‚ÄÚOH, IT‚ÄÔS NOT WORTH WHILE FIXING A TIME. I‚ÄÔLL SIMPLY GIVE HIM THE MESSAGE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚVERY WELL, DO. ADD THAT I CERTAINLY WILL FIX A TIME TO SEE HIM THOUGH. BE SURE TO SAY THAT TOO.‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH RAN OFF, GRINNING. HE WAS, IN FACT, TO THE BEST OF MY RECOLLECTION, PARTICULARLY SPITEFUL ALL THIS TIME, AND VENTURED UPON EXTREMELY IMPATIENT SALLIES WITH ALMOST EVERY ONE. STRANGE TO SAY, EVERY ONE, SOMEHOW, FORGAVE HIM. IT WAS GENERALLY ACCEPTED THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE LOOKED AT FROM THE ORDINARY STANDPOINT. I MAY REMARK THAT HE TOOK UP AN EXTREMELY RESENTFUL ATTITUDE ABOUT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH‚ÄÔS DUEL. IT TOOK HIM UNAWARES. HE TURNED POSITIVELY GREEN WHEN HE WAS TOLD OF IT. PERHAPS HIS VANITY WAS WOUNDED: HE ONLY HEARD OF IT NEXT DAY WHEN EVERY ONE KNEW OF IT.

‚ÄÚYOU HAD NO RIGHT TO FIGHT, YOU KNOW,‚ÄÙ HE WHISPERED TO STAVROGIN, FIVE DAYS LATER, WHEN HE CHANCED TO MEET HIM AT THE CLUB. IT WAS REMARKABLE THAT THEY HAD NOT ONCE MET DURING THOSE FIVE DAYS, THOUGH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD DROPPED IN AT VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS ALMOST EVERY DAY.

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH LOOKED AT HIM IN SILENCE WITH AN ABSENT-MINDED AIR, AS THOUGH NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS THE MATTER, AND HE WENT ON WITHOUT STOPPING. HE WAS CROSSING THE BIG HALL OF THE CLUB ON HIS WAY TO THE REFRESHMENT ROOM.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN TO SEE SHATOV TOO.‚Ä¶ YOU MEAN TO MAKE IT KNOWN ABOUT MARYA TIMOFYEVNA,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH MUTTERED, RUNNING AFTER HIM, AND, AS THOUGH NOT THINKING OF WHAT HE WAS DOING HE CLUTCHED AT HIS SHOULDER.

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SHOOK HIS HAND OFF AND TURNED ROUND QUICKLY TO HIM WITH A MENACING SCOWL. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH LOOKED AT HIM WITH A STRANGE, PROLONGED SMILE. IT ALL LASTED ONLY ONE MOMENT. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WALKED ON.

II

HE WENT TO THE ‚ÄÚOLD MAN‚ÄÙ STRAIGHT FROM VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS, AND HE WAS IN SUCH HASTE SIMPLY FROM SPITE, THAT HE MIGHT REVENGE HIMSELF FOR AN INSULT OF WHICH I HAD NO IDEA AT THAT TIME. THE FACT IS THAT AT THEIR LAST INTERVIEW ON THE THURSDAY OF THE PREVIOUS WEEK, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, THOUGH THE DISPUTE WAS ONE OF HIS OWN BEGINNING, HAD ENDED BY TURNING PYOTR STEPANOVITCH OUT WITH HIS STICK. HE CONCEALED THE INCIDENT FROM ME AT THE TIME. BUT NOW, AS SOON AS PYOTR STEPANOVITCH RAN IN WITH HIS EVERLASTING GRIN, WHICH WAS SO NA√ØVELY CONDESCENDING, AND HIS UNPLEASANTLY INQUISITIVE EYES PEERING INTO EVERY CORNER, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH AT ONCE MADE A SIGNAL ASIDE TO ME, NOT TO LEAVE THE ROOM. THIS WAS HOW THEIR REAL RELATIONS CAME TO BE EXPOSED BEFORE ME, FOR ON THIS OCCASION I HEARD THEIR WHOLE CONVERSATION.

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS SITTING STRETCHED OUT ON A LOUNGE. HE HAD GROWN THIN AND SALLOW SINCE THAT THURSDAY. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SEATED HIMSELF BESIDE HIM WITH A MOST FAMILIAR AIR, UNCEREMONIOUSLY TUCKING HIS LEGS UP UNDER HIM, AND TAKING UP MORE ROOM ON THE LOUNGE THAN DEFERENCE TO HIS FATHER SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH MOVED ASIDE, IN SILENCE, AND WITH DIGNITY.

ON THE TABLE LAY AN OPEN BOOK. IT WAS THE NOVEL, ‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS TO BE DONE?‚ÄÙ ALAS, I MUST CONFESS ONE STRANGE WEAKNESS IN MY FRIEND; THE FANTASY THAT HE OUGHT TO COME FORTH FROM HIS SOLITUDE AND FIGHT A LAST BATTLE WAS GETTING MORE AND MORE HOLD UPON HIS DELUDED IMAGINATION. I GUESSED THAT HE HAD GOT THE NOVEL AND WAS STUDYING IT SOLELY IN ORDER THAT WHEN THE INEVITABLE CONFLICT WITH THE ‚ÄÚSHRIEKERS‚ÄÙ CAME ABOUT HE MIGHT KNOW THEIR METHODS AND ARGUMENTS BEFOREHAND, FROM THEIR VERY ‚ÄÚCATECHISM,‚ÄÙ AND IN THAT WAY BE PREPARED TO CONFUTE THEM ALL TRIUMPHANTLY, BEFORE HER EYES. OH, HOW THAT BOOK TORTURED HIM! HE SOMETIMES FLUNG IT ASIDE IN DESPAIR, AND LEAPING UP, PACED ABOUT THE ROOM ALMOST IN A FRENZY.

‚ÄÚI AGREE THAT THE AUTHOR‚ÄÔS FUNDAMENTAL IDEA IS A TRUE ONE,‚ÄÙ HE SAID TO ME FEVERISHLY, ‚ÄÚBUT THAT ONLY MAKES IT MORE AWFUL. IT‚ÄÔS JUST OUR IDEA, EXACTLY OURS; WE FIRST SOWED THE SEED, NURTURED IT, PREPARED THE WAY, AND, INDEED, WHAT COULD THEY SAY NEW, AFTER US? BUT, HEAVENS! HOW IT‚ÄÔS ALL EXPRESSED, DISTORTED, MUTILATED!‚ÄÙ HE EXCLAIMED, TAPPING THE BOOK WITH HIS FINGERS. ‚ÄÚWERE THESE THE CONCLUSIONS WE WERE STRIVING FOR? WHO CAN UNDERSTAND THE ORIGINAL IDEA IN THIS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIMPROVING YOUR MIND?‚ÄÙ SNIGGERED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, TAKING THE BOOK FROM THE TABLE AND READING THE TITLE. ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS HIGH TIME. I‚ÄÔLL BRING YOU BETTER, IF YOU LIKE.‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH AGAIN PRESERVED A DIGNIFIED SILENCE. I WAS SITTING ON A SOFA IN THE CORNER.

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH QUICKLY EXPLAINED THE REASON OF HIS COMING. OF COURSE, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS ABSOLUTELY STAGGERED, AND HE LISTENED IN ALARM, WHICH WAS MIXED WITH EXTREME INDIGNATION.

‚ÄÚAND THAT YULIA MIHAILOVNA COUNTS ON MY COMING TO READ FOR HER!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, THEY‚ÄÔRE BY NO MEANS IN SUCH NEED OF YOU. ON THE CONTRARY, IT‚ÄÔS BY WAY OF AN ATTENTION TO YOU, SO AS TO MAKE UP TO VARVARA PETROVNA. BUT, OF COURSE, YOU WON‚ÄÔT DARE TO REFUSE, AND I EXPECT YOU WANT TO YOURSELF,‚ÄÙ HE ADDED WITH A GRIN. ‚ÄÚYOU OLD FOGIES ARE ALL SO DEVILISHLY AMBITIOUS. BUT, I SAY THOUGH, YOU MUST LOOK OUT THAT IT‚ÄÔS NOT TOO BORING. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? SPANISH HISTORY, OR WHAT IS IT? YOU‚ÄÔD BETTER LET ME LOOK AT IT THREE DAYS BEFOREHAND, OR ELSE YOU‚ÄÔLL PUT US TO SLEEP PERHAPS.‚ÄÙ

THE HURRIED AND TOO BAREFACED COARSENESS OF THESE THRUSTS WAS OBVIOUSLY PREMEDITATED. HE AFFECTED TO BEHAVE AS THOUGH IT WERE IMPOSSIBLE TO TALK TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH IN DIFFERENT AND MORE DELICATE LANGUAGE. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH RESOLUTELY PERSISTED IN IGNORING HIS INSULTS, BUT WHAT HIS SON TOLD HIM MADE A MORE AND MORE OVERWHELMING IMPRESSION UPON HIM.

‚ÄÚAND SHE, SHE HERSELF SENT ME THIS MESSAGE THROUGH YOU?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED, TURNING PALE.

‚ÄÚWELL, YOU SEE, SHE MEANS TO FIX A TIME AND PLACE FOR A MUTUAL EXPLANATION, THE RELICS OF YOUR SENTIMENTALISING. YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN COQUETTING WITH HER FOR TWENTY YEARS AND HAVE TRAINED HER TO THE MOST RIDICULOUS HABITS. BUT DON‚ÄÔT TROUBLE YOURSELF, IT‚ÄÔS QUITE DIFFERENT NOW. SHE KEEPS SAYING HERSELF THAT SHE‚ÄÔS ONLY BEGINNING NOW TO ‚ÄÒHAVE HER EYES OPENED.‚ÄÔ I TOLD HER IN SO MANY WORDS THAT ALL THIS FRIENDSHIP OF YOURS IS NOTHING BUT A MUTUAL POURING FORTH OF SLOPPINESS. SHE TOLD ME LOTS, MY BOY. FOO! WHAT A FLUNKEY‚ÄÔS PLACE YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN FILLING ALL THIS TIME. I POSITIVELY BLUSHED FOR YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI FILLING A FLUNKEY‚ÄÔS PLACE?‚ÄÙ CRIED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, UNABLE TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF.

‚ÄÚWORSE, YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN A PARASITE, THAT IS, A VOLUNTARY FLUNKEY TOO LAZY TO WORK, WHILE YOU‚ÄÔVE AN APPETITE FOR MONEY. SHE, TOO, UNDERSTANDS ALL THAT NOW. IT‚ÄÔS AWFUL THE THINGS SHE‚ÄÔS BEEN TELLING ME ABOUT YOU, ANYWAY. I DID LAUGH, MY BOY, OVER YOUR LETTERS TO HER; SHAMEFUL AND DISGUSTING. BUT YOU‚ÄÔRE ALL SO DEPRAVED, SO DEPRAVED! THERE‚ÄÔS ALWAYS SOMETHING DEPRAVING IN CHARITY‚ÄÎYOU‚ÄÔRE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF IT!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSHE SHOWED YOU MY LETTERS!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚALL; THOUGH, OF COURSE, ONE COULDN‚ÄÔT READ THEM ALL. FOO, WHAT A LOT OF PAPER YOU‚ÄÔVE COVERED! I BELIEVE THERE ARE MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND LETTERS THERE. AND DO YOU KNOW, OLD CHAP, I BELIEVE THERE WAS ONE MOMENT WHEN SHE‚ÄÔD HAVE BEEN READY TO MARRY YOU. YOU LET SLIP YOUR CHANCE IN THE SILLIEST WAY. OF COURSE, I‚ÄÔM SPEAKING FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW, THOUGH, ANYWAY, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN NOW WHEN YOU‚ÄÔVE ALMOST BEEN MARRIED TO ‚ÄÒCOVER ANOTHER MAN‚ÄÔS SINS,‚ÄÔ LIKE A BUFFOON, FOR A JEST, FOR MONEY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFOR MONEY! SHE, SHE SAYS IT WAS FOR MONEY!‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAILED IN ANGUISH.

‚ÄÚWHAT ELSE, THEN? BUT, OF COURSE, I STOOD UP FOR YOU. THAT‚ÄÔS YOUR ONLY LINE OF DEFENCE, YOU KNOW. SHE SEES FOR HERSELF THAT YOU NEEDED MONEY LIKE EVERY ONE ELSE, AND THAT FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW MAYBE YOU WERE RIGHT. I PROVED TO HER AS CLEAR AS TWICE TWO MAKES FOUR THAT IT WAS A MUTUAL BARGAIN. SHE WAS A CAPITALIST AND YOU WERE A SENTIMENTAL BUFFOON IN HER SERVICE. SHE‚ÄÔS NOT ANGRY ABOUT THE MONEY, THOUGH YOU HAVE MILKED HER LIKE A GOAT. SHE‚ÄÔS ONLY IN A RAGE AT HAVING BELIEVED IN YOU FOR TWENTY YEARS, AT YOUR HAVING SO TAKEN HER IN OVER THESE NOBLE SENTIMENTS, AND MADE HER TELL LIES FOR SO LONG. SHE NEVER WILL ADMIT THAT SHE TOLD LIES OF HERSELF, BUT YOU‚ÄÔLL CATCH IT THE MORE FOR THAT. I CAN‚ÄÔT MAKE OUT HOW IT WAS YOU DIDN‚ÄÔT SEE THAT YOU‚ÄÔD HAVE TO HAVE A DAY OF RECKONING. FOR AFTER ALL YOU HAD SOME SENSE. I ADVISED HER YESTERDAY TO PUT YOU IN AN ALMSHOUSE, A GENTEEL ONE, DON‚ÄÔT DISTURB YOURSELF; THERE‚ÄÔLL BE NOTHING HUMILIATING; I BELIEVE THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT SHE‚ÄÔLL DO. DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR LAST LETTER TO ME, THREE WEEKS AGO?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCAN YOU HAVE SHOWN HER THAT?‚ÄÙ CRIED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, LEAPING UP IN HORROR.

‚ÄÚRATHER! FIRST THING. THE ONE IN WHICH YOU TOLD ME SHE WAS EXPLOITING YOU, ENVIOUS OF YOUR TALENT; OH, YES, AND THAT ABOUT ‚ÄÒOTHER MEN‚ÄÔS SINS.‚ÄÔ YOU HAVE GOT A CONCEIT THOUGH, MY BOY! HOW I DID LAUGH. AS A RULE YOUR LETTERS ARE VERY TEDIOUS. YOU WRITE A HORRIBLE STYLE. I OFTEN DON‚ÄÔT READ THEM AT ALL, AND I‚ÄÔVE ONE LYING ABOUT TO THIS DAY, UNOPENED. I‚ÄÔLL SEND IT TO YOU TO-MORROW. BUT THAT ONE, THAT LAST LETTER OF YOURS WAS THE TIPTOP OF PERFECTION! HOW I DID LAUGH! OH, HOW I LAUGHED!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMONSTER, MONSTER!‚ÄÙ WAILED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.

‚ÄÚFOO, DAMN IT ALL, THERE‚ÄÔS NO TALKING TO YOU. I SAY, YOU‚ÄÔRE GETTING HUFFY AGAIN AS YOU WERE LAST THURSDAY.‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH DREW HIMSELF UP, MENACINGLY.

‚ÄÚHOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME IN SUCH LANGUAGE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT LANGUAGE? IT‚ÄÔS SIMPLE AND CLEAR.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTELL ME, YOU MONSTER, ARE YOU MY SON OR NOT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU KNOW THAT BEST. TO BE SURE ALL FATHERS ARE DISPOSED TO BE BLIND IN SUCH CASES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSILENCE! SILENCE!‚ÄÙ CRIED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, SHAKING ALL OVER.

‚ÄÚYOU SEE YOU‚ÄÔRE SCREAMING AND SWEARING AT ME AS YOU DID LAST THURSDAY. YOU TRIED TO LIFT YOUR STICK AGAINST ME, BUT YOU KNOW, I FOUND THAT DOCUMENT. I WAS RUMMAGING ALL THE EVENING IN MY TRUNK FROM CURIOSITY. IT‚ÄÔS TRUE THERE‚ÄÔS NOTHING DEFINITE, YOU CAN TAKE THAT COMFORT. IT‚ÄÔS ONLY A LETTER OF MY MOTHER‚ÄÔS TO THAT POLE. BUT TO JUDGE FROM HER CHARACTER ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚANOTHER WORD AND I‚ÄÔLL BOX YOUR EARS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT A SET OF PEOPLE!‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, SUDDENLY ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO ME. ‚ÄÚYOU SEE, THIS IS HOW WE‚ÄÔVE BEEN EVER SINCE LAST THURSDAY. I‚ÄÔM GLAD YOU‚ÄÔRE HERE THIS TIME, ANYWAY, AND CAN JUDGE BETWEEN US. TO BEGIN WITH, A FACT: HE REPROACHES ME FOR SPEAKING LIKE THIS OF MY MOTHER, BUT DIDN‚ÄÔT HE EGG ME ON TO IT? IN PETERSBURG BEFORE I LEFT THE HIGH SCHOOL, DIDN‚ÄÔT HE WAKE ME TWICE IN THE NIGHT, TO EMBRACE ME, AND CRY LIKE A WOMAN, AND WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE HE TALKED TO ME ABOUT AT NIGHT? WHY, THE SAME MODEST ANECDOTES ABOUT MY MOTHER! IT WAS FROM HIM I FIRST HEARD THEM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, I MEANT THAT IN A HIGHER SENSE! OH, YOU DIDN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND ME! YOU UNDERSTOOD NOTHING, NOTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT, ANYWAY, IT WAS MEANER IN YOU THAN IN ME, MEANER, ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. YOU SEE, IT‚ÄÔS NOTHING TO ME IF YOU LIKE. I‚ÄÔM SPEAKING FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW. DON‚ÄÔT WORRY ABOUT MY POINT OF VIEW. I DON‚ÄÔT BLAME MY MOTHER; IF IT‚ÄÔS YOU, THEN IT‚ÄÔS YOU, IF IT‚ÄÔS A POLE, THEN IT‚ÄÔS A POLE, IT‚ÄÔS ALL THE SAME TO ME. I‚ÄÔM NOT TO BLAME BECAUSE YOU AND SHE MANAGED SO STUPIDLY IN BERLIN. AS THOUGH YOU COULD HAVE MANAGED THINGS BETTER. AREN‚ÄÔT YOU AN ABSURD SET, AFTER THAT? AND DOES IT MATTER TO YOU WHETHER I‚ÄÔM YOUR SON OR NOT? LISTEN,‚ÄÙ HE WENT ON, TURNING TO ME AGAIN, ‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS NEVER SPENT A PENNY ON ME ALL HIS LIFE; TILL I WAS SIXTEEN HE DIDN‚ÄÔT KNOW ME AT ALL; AFTERWARDS HE ROBBED ME HERE, AND NOW HE CRIES OUT THAT HIS HEART HAS BEEN ACHING OVER ME ALL HIS LIFE, AND CARRIES ON BEFORE ME LIKE AN ACTOR. I‚ÄÔM NOT VARVARA PETROVNA, MIND YOU.‚ÄÙ

HE GOT UP AND TOOK HIS HAT.

‚ÄÚI CURSE YOU HENCEFORTH!‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, AS PALE AS DEATH, STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND ABOVE HIM.

‚ÄÚACH, WHAT FOLLY A MAN WILL DESCEND TO!‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, ACTUALLY SURPRISED. ‚ÄÚWELL, GOOD-BYE, OLD FELLOW, I SHALL NEVER COME AND SEE YOU AGAIN. SEND ME THE ARTICLE BEFOREHAND, DON‚ÄÔT FORGET, AND TRY AND LET IT BE FREE FROM NONSENSE. FACTS, FACTS, FACTS. AND ABOVE ALL, LET IT BE SHORT. GOOD-BYE.‚ÄÙ

III

OUTSIDE INFLUENCES, TOO, HAD COME INTO PLAY IN THE MATTER, HOWEVER. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH CERTAINLY HAD SOME DESIGNS ON HIS PARENT. IN MY OPINION HE CALCULATED UPON REDUCING THE OLD MAN TO DESPAIR, AND SO TO DRIVING HIM TO SOME OPEN SCANDAL OF A CERTAIN SORT. THIS WAS TO SERVE SOME REMOTE AND QUITE OTHER OBJECT OF HIS OWN, OF WHICH I SHALL SPEAK HEREAFTER. ALL SORTS OF PLANS AND CALCULATIONS OF THIS KIND WERE SWARMING IN MASSES IN HIS MIND AT THAT TIME, AND ALMOST ALL, OF COURSE, OF A FANTASTIC CHARACTER. HE HAD DESIGNS ON ANOTHER VICTIM BESIDES STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. IN FACT, AS APPEARED AFTERWARDS, HIS VICTIMS WERE NOT FEW IN NUMBER, BUT THIS ONE HE RECKONED UPON PARTICULARLY, AND IT WAS MR. VON LEMBKE HIMSELF.

ANDREY ANTONOVITCH VON LEMBKE BELONGED TO THAT RACE, SO FAVOURED BY NATURE, WHICH IS RECKONED BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AT THE RUSSIAN CENSUS, AND IS PERHAPS UNCONSCIOUS THAT IT FORMS THROUGHOUT ITS WHOLE MASS A STRICTLY ORGANISED UNION. AND THIS UNION, OF COURSE, IS NOT PLANNED AND PREMEDITATED, BUT EXISTS SPONTANEOUSLY IN THE WHOLE RACE, WITHOUT WORDS OR AGREEMENTS AS A MORAL OBLIGATION CONSISTING IN MUTUAL SUPPORT GIVEN BY ALL MEMBERS OF THE RACE TO ONE ANOTHER, AT ALL TIMES AND PLACES, AND UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. ANDREY ANTONOVITCH HAD THE HONOUR OF BEING EDUCATED IN ONE OF THOSE MORE EXALTED RUSSIAN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WHICH ARE FILLED WITH THE YOUTH FROM FAMILIES WELL PROVIDED WITH WEALTH OR CONNECTIONS. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY ON FINISHING THEIR STUDIES THE PUPILS WERE APPOINTED TO RATHER IMPORTANT POSTS IN ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS. ANDREY ANTONOVITCH HAD ONE UNCLE A COLONEL OF ENGINEERS, AND ANOTHER A BAKER. BUT HE MANAGED TO GET INTO THIS ARISTOCRATIC SCHOOL, AND MET MANY OF HIS FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN IN A SIMILAR POSITION. HE WAS A GOOD-HUMOURED COMPANION, WAS RATHER STUPID AT HIS STUDIES, BUT ALWAYS POPULAR. AND WHEN MANY OF HIS COMPANIONS IN THE UPPER FORMS‚ÄÎCHIEFLY RUSSIANS‚ÄÎHAD ALREADY LEARNT TO DISCUSS THE LOFTIEST MODERN QUESTIONS, AND LOOKED AS THOUGH THEY WERE ONLY WAITING TO LEAVE SCHOOL TO SETTLE THE AFFAIRS OF THE UNIVERSE, ANDREY ANTONOVITCH WAS STILL ABSORBED IN THE MOST INNOCENT SCHOOLBOY INTERESTS. HE AMUSED THEM ALL, IT IS TRUE, BY HIS PRANKS, WHICH WERE OF A VERY SIMPLE CHARACTER, AT THE MOST A LITTLE COARSE, BUT HE MADE IT HIS OBJECT TO BE FUNNY. AT ONE TIME HE WOULD BLOW HIS NOSE IN A WONDERFUL WAY WHEN THE PROFESSOR ADDRESSED A QUESTION TO HIM, THEREBY MAKING HIS SCHOOLFELLOWS AND THE PROFESSOR LAUGH. ANOTHER TIME, IN THE DORMITORY, HE WOULD ACT SOME INDECENT LIVING PICTURE, TO THE GENERAL APPLAUSE, OR HE WOULD PLAY THE OVERTURE TO ‚ÄÚFRA DIAVOLO‚ÄÙ WITH HIS NOSE RATHER SKILFULLY. HE WAS DISTINGUISHED, TOO, BY INTENTIONAL UNTIDINESS, THINKING THIS, FOR SOME REASON, WITTY. IN HIS VERY LAST YEAR AT SCHOOL HE BEGAN WRITING RUSSIAN POETRY.

OF HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE HE HAD ONLY AN UNGRAMMATICAL KNOWLEDGE, LIKE MANY OF HIS RACE IN RUSSIA. THIS TURN FOR VERSIFYING DREW HIM TO A GLOOMY AND DEPRESSED SCHOOLFELLOW, THE SON OF A POOR RUSSIAN GENERAL, WHO WAS CONSIDERED IN THE SCHOOL TO BE A GREAT FUTURE LIGHT IN LITERATURE. THE LATTER PATRONISED HIM. BUT IT HAPPENED THAT THREE YEARS AFTER LEAVING SCHOOL THIS MELANCHOLY SCHOOLFELLOW, WHO HAD FLUNG UP HIS OFFICIAL CAREER FOR THE SAKE OF RUSSIAN LITERATURE, AND WAS CONSEQUENTLY GOING ABOUT IN TORN BOOTS, WITH HIS TEETH CHATTERING WITH COLD, WEARING A LIGHT SUMMER OVERCOAT IN THE LATE AUTUMN, MET, ONE DAY ON THE ANITCHIN BRIDGE, HIS FORMER PROT√©G√©, ‚ÄÚLEMBKA,‚ÄÙ AS HE ALWAYS USED TO BE CALLED AT SCHOOL. AND, WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE? HE DID NOT AT FIRST RECOGNISE HIM, AND STOOD STILL IN SURPRISE. BEFORE HIM STOOD AN IRREPROACHABLY DRESSED YOUNG MAN WITH WONDERFULLY WELL-KEPT WHISKERS OF A REDDISH HUE, WITH PINCE-NEZ, WITH PATENT-LEATHER BOOTS, AND THE FRESHEST OF GLOVES, IN A FULL OVERCOAT FROM SHARMER‚ÄÔS, AND WITH A PORTFOLIO UNDER HIS ARM. LEMBKE WAS CORDIAL TO HIS OLD SCHOOLFELLOW, GAVE HIM HIS ADDRESS, AND BEGGED HIM TO COME AND SEE HIM SOME EVENING. IT APPEARED, TOO, THAT HE WAS BY NOW NOT ‚ÄÚLEMBKA‚ÄÙ BUT ‚ÄÚVON LEMBKE.‚ÄÙ THE SCHOOLFELLOW CAME TO SEE HIM, HOWEVER, SIMPLY FROM MALICE PERHAPS. ON THE STAIRCASE, WHICH WAS COVERED WITH RED FELT AND WAS RATHER UGLY AND BY NO MEANS SMART, HE WAS MET AND QUESTIONED BY THE HOUSE-PORTER. A BELL RANG LOUDLY UPSTAIRS. BUT INSTEAD OF THE WEALTH WHICH THE VISITOR EXPECTED, HE FOUND LEMBKE IN A VERY LITTLE SIDE-ROOM, WHICH HAD A DARK AND DILAPIDATED APPEARANCE, PARTITIONED INTO TWO BY A LARGE DARK GREEN CURTAIN, AND FURNISHED WITH VERY OLD THOUGH COMFORTABLE FURNITURE, WITH DARK GREEN BLINDS ON HIGH NARROW WINDOWS. VON LEMBKE LODGED IN THE HOUSE OF A VERY DISTANT RELATION, A GENERAL WHO WAS HIS PATRON. HE MET HIS VISITOR CORDIALLY, WAS SERIOUS AND EXQUISITELY POLITE. THEY TALKED OF LITERATURE, TOO, BUT KEPT WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF DECORUM. A MANSERVANT IN A WHITE TIE BROUGHT THEM SOME WEAK TEA AND LITTLE DRY, ROUND BISCUITS. THE SCHOOLFELLOW, FROM SPITE, ASKED FOR SOME SELTZER WATER. IT WAS GIVEN HIM, BUT AFTER SOME DELAYS, AND LEMBKE WAS SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED AT HAVING TO SUMMON THE FOOTMAN A SECOND TIME AND GIVE HIM ORDERS. BUT OF HIMSELF HE ASKED HIS VISITOR WHETHER HE WOULD LIKE SOME SUPPER, AND WAS OBVIOUSLY RELIEVED WHEN HE REFUSED AND WENT AWAY. IN SHORT, LEMBKE WAS MAKING HIS CAREER, AND WAS LIVING IN DEPENDENCE ON HIS FELLOW-COUNTRYMAN, THE INFLUENTIAL GENERAL.

HE WAS AT THAT TIME SIGHING FOR THE GENERAL‚ÄÔS FIFTH DAUGHTER, AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HIS FEELING WAS RECIPROCATED. BUT AMALIA WAS NONE THE LESS MARRIED IN DUE TIME TO AN ELDERLY FACTORY-OWNER, A GERMAN, AND AN OLD COMRADE OF THE GENERAL‚ÄÔS. ANDREY ANTONOVITCH DID NOT SHED MANY TEARS, BUT MADE A PAPER THEATRE. THE CURTAIN DREW UP, THE ACTORS CAME IN, AND GESTICULATED WITH THEIR ARMS. THERE WERE SPECTATORS IN THE BOXES, THE ORCHESTRA MOVED THEIR BOWS ACROSS THEIR FIDDLES BY MACHINERY, THE CONDUCTOR WAVED HIS BATON, AND IN THE STALLS OFFICERS AND DANDIES CLAPPED THEIR HANDS. IT WAS ALL MADE OF CARDBOARD, IT WAS ALL THOUGHT OUT AND EXECUTED BY LEMBKE HIMSELF. HE SPENT SIX MONTHS OVER THIS THEATRE. THE GENERAL ARRANGED A FRIENDLY PARTY ON PURPOSE. THE THEATRE WAS EXHIBITED, ALL THE GENERAL‚ÄÔS FIVE DAUGHTERS, INCLUDING THE NEWLY MARRIED AMALIA WITH HER FACTORY-OWNER, NUMEROUS FRAUS AND FRAULEINS WITH THEIR MEN FOLK, ATTENTIVELY EXAMINED AND ADMIRED THE THEATRE, AFTER WHICH THEY DANCED. LEMBKE WAS MUCH GRATIFIED AND WAS QUICKLY CONSOLED.

THE YEARS PASSED BY AND HIS CAREER WAS SECURED. HE ALWAYS OBTAINED GOOD POSTS AND ALWAYS UNDER CHIEFS OF HIS OWN RACE; AND HE WORKED HIS WAY UP AT LAST TO A VERY FINE POSITION FOR A MAN OF HIS AGE. HE HAD, FOR A LONG TIME, BEEN WISHING TO MARRY AND LOOKING ABOUT HIM CAREFULLY. WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS SUPERIORS HE HAD SENT A NOVEL TO THE EDITOR OF A MAGAZINE, BUT IT HAD NOT BEEN ACCEPTED. ON THE OTHER HAND, HE CUT OUT A COMPLETE TOY RAILWAY, AND AGAIN HIS CREATION WAS MOST SUCCESSFUL. PASSENGERS CAME ON TO THE PLATFORM WITH BAGS AND PORTMANTEAUX, WITH DOGS AND CHILDREN, AND GOT INTO THE CARRIAGES. THE GUARDS AND PORTERS MOVED AWAY, THE BELL WAS RUNG, THE SIGNAL WAS GIVEN, AND THE TRAIN STARTED OFF. HE WAS A WHOLE YEAR BUSY OVER THIS CLEVER CONTRIVANCE. BUT HE HAD TO GET MARRIED ALL THE SAME. THE CIRCLE OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE WAS FAIRLY WIDE, CHIEFLY IN THE WORLD OF HIS COMPATRIOTS, BUT HIS DUTIES BROUGHT HIM INTO RUSSIAN SPHERES ALSO, OF COURSE. FINALLY, WHEN HE WAS IN HIS THIRTY-NINTH YEAR, HE CAME IN FOR A LEGACY. HIS UNCLE THE BAKER DIED, AND LEFT HIM THIRTEEN THOUSAND ROUBLES IN HIS WILL. THE ONE THING NEEDFUL WAS A SUITABLE POST. IN SPITE OF THE RATHER ELEVATED STYLE OF HIS SURROUNDINGS IN THE SERVICE, MR. VON LEMBKE WAS A VERY MODEST MAN. HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH SOME INDEPENDENT LITTLE GOVERNMENT POST, WITH THE RIGHT TO AS MUCH GOVERNMENT TIMBER AS HE LIKED, OR SOMETHING SNUG OF THAT SORT, AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTENT ALL HIS LIFE LONG. BUT NOW, INSTEAD OF THE MINNA OR ERNESTINE HE HAD EXPECTED, YULIA MIHAILOVNA SUDDENLY APPEARED ON THE SCENE. HIS CAREER WAS INSTANTLY RAISED TO A MORE ELEVATED PLANE. THE MODEST AND PRECISE MAN FELT THAT HE TOO WAS CAPABLE OF AMBITION.

YULIA MIHAILOVNA HAD A FORTUNE OF TWO HUNDRED SERFS, TO RECKON IN THE OLD STYLE, AND SHE HAD BESIDES POWERFUL FRIENDS. ON THE OTHER HAND LEMBKE WAS HANDSOME, AND SHE WAS ALREADY OVER FORTY. IT IS REMARKABLE THAT HE FELL GENUINELY IN LOVE WITH HER BY DEGREES AS HE BECAME MORE USED TO BEING BETROTHED TO HER. ON THE MORNING OF HIS WEDDING DAY HE SENT HER A POEM. SHE LIKED ALL THIS VERY MUCH, EVEN THE POEM; IT‚ÄÔS NO JOKE TO BE FORTY. HE WAS VERY QUICKLY RAISED TO A CERTAIN GRADE AND RECEIVED A CERTAIN ORDER OF DISTINCTION, AND THEN WAS APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF OUR PROVINCE.

BEFORE COMING TO US YULIA MIHAILOVNA WORKED HARD AT MOULDING HER HUSBAND. IN HER OPINION HE WAS NOT WITHOUT ABILITIES, HE KNEW HOW TO MAKE AN ENTRANCE AND TO APPEAR TO ADVANTAGE, HE UNDERSTOOD HOW TO LISTEN AND BE SILENT WITH PROFUNDITY, HAD ACQUIRED A QUITE DISTINGUISHED DEPORTMENT, COULD MAKE A SPEECH, INDEED HAD EVEN SOME ODDS AND ENDS OF THOUGHT, AND HAD CAUGHT THE NECESSARY GLOSS OF MODERN LIBERALISM. WHAT WORRIED HER, HOWEVER, WAS THAT HE WAS NOT VERY OPEN TO NEW IDEAS, AND AFTER THE LONG, EVERLASTING PLODDING FOR A CAREER, WAS UNMISTAKABLY BEGINNING TO FEEL THE NEED OF REPOSE. SHE TRIED TO INFECT HIM WITH HER OWN AMBITION, AND HE SUDDENLY BEGAN MAKING A TOY CHURCH: THE PASTOR CAME OUT TO PREACH THE SERMON, THE CONGREGATION LISTENED WITH THEIR HANDS BEFORE THEM, ONE LADY WAS DRYING HER TEARS WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF, ONE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS BLOWING HIS NOSE; FINALLY THE ORGAN PEALED FORTH. IT HAD BEEN ORDERED FROM SWITZERLAND, AND MADE EXPRESSLY IN SPITE OF ALL EXPENSE. YULIA MIHAILOVNA, IN POSITIVE ALARM, CARRIED OFF THE WHOLE STRUCTURE AS SOON AS SHE KNEW ABOUT IT, AND LOCKED IT UP IN A BOX IN HER OWN ROOM. TO MAKE UP FOR IT SHE ALLOWED HIM TO WRITE A NOVEL ON CONDITION OF ITS BEING KEPT SECRET. FROM THAT TIME SHE BEGAN TO RECKON ONLY UPON HERSELF. UNHAPPILY THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF SHALLOWNESS AND LACK OF JUDGMENT IN HER ATTITUDE. DESTINY HAD KEPT HER TOO LONG AN OLD MAID. NOW ONE IDEA AFTER ANOTHER FLUTTERED THROUGH HER AMBITIOUS AND RATHER OVER-EXCITED BRAIN. SHE CHERISHED DESIGNS, SHE POSITIVELY DESIRED TO RULE THE PROVINCE, DREAMED OF BECOMING AT ONCE THE CENTRE OF A CIRCLE, ADOPTED POLITICAL SYMPATHIES. VON LEMBKE WAS ACTUALLY A LITTLE ALARMED, THOUGH, WITH HIS OFFICIAL TACT, HE QUICKLY DIVINED THAT HE HAD NO NEED AT ALL TO BE UNEASY ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE ITSELF. THE FIRST TWO OR THREE MONTHS PASSED INDEED VERY SATISFACTORILY. BUT NOW PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD TURNED UP, AND SOMETHING QUEER BEGAN TO HAPPEN.

THE FACT WAS THAT YOUNG VERHOVENSKY, FROM THE FIRST STEP, HAD DISPLAYED A FLAGRANT LACK OF RESPECT FOR ANDREY ANTONOVITCH, AND HAD ASSUMED A STRANGE RIGHT TO DICTATE TO HIM; WHILE YULIA MIHAILOVNA, WHO HAD ALWAYS TILL THEN BEEN SO JEALOUS OF HER HUSBAND‚ÄÔS DIGNITY, ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO NOTICE IT; OR, AT ANY RATE, ATTACHED NO CONSEQUENCE TO IT. THE YOUNG MAN BECAME A FAVOURITE, ATE, DRANK, AND ALMOST SLEPT IN THE HOUSE. VON LEMBKE TRIED TO DEFEND HIMSELF, CALLED HIM ‚ÄÚYOUNG MAN‚ÄÙ BEFORE OTHER PEOPLE, AND SLAPPED HIM PATRONISINGLY ON THE SHOULDER, BUT MADE NO IMPRESSION. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE LAUGHING IN HIS FACE EVEN WHEN HE APPEARED ON THE SURFACE TO BE TALKING SERIOUSLY TO HIM, AND HE WOULD SAY THE MOST STARTLING THINGS TO HIM BEFORE COMPANY. RETURNING HOME ONE DAY HE FOUND THE YOUNG MAN HAD INSTALLED HIMSELF IN HIS STUDY AND WAS ASLEEP ON THE SOFA THERE, UNINVITED. HE EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD COME IN, AND FINDING NO ONE AT HOME HAD ‚ÄÚHAD A GOOD SLEEP.‚ÄÙ

VON LEMBKE WAS OFFENDED AND AGAIN COMPLAINED TO HIS WIFE. LAUGHING AT HIS IRRITABILITY SHE OBSERVED TARTLY THAT HE EVIDENTLY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO KEEP UP HIS OWN DIGNITY; AND THAT WITH HER, ANYWAY, ‚ÄÚTHE BOY‚ÄÙ HAD NEVER PERMITTED HIMSELF ANY UNDUE FAMILIARITY, ‚ÄÚHE WAS NA√ØVE AND FRESH INDEED, THOUGH NOT REGARDFUL OF THE CONVENTIONS OF SOCIETY.‚ÄÙ VON LEMBKE SULKED. THIS TIME SHE MADE PEACE BETWEEN THEM. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH DID NOT GO SO FAR AS TO APOLOGISE, BUT GOT OUT OF IT WITH A COARSE JEST, WHICH MIGHT AT ANOTHER TIME HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR A FRESH OFFENCE, BUT WAS ACCEPTED ON THIS OCCASION AS A TOKEN OF REPENTANCE. THE WEAK SPOT IN ANDREY ANTONOVITCH‚ÄÔS POSITION WAS THAT HE HAD BLUNDERED IN THE FIRST INSTANCE BY DIVULGING THE SECRET OF HIS NOVEL TO HIM. IMAGINING HIM TO BE AN ARDENT YOUNG MAN OF POETIC FEELING AND HAVING LONG DREAMED OF SECURING A LISTENER, HE HAD, DURING THE EARLY DAYS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE, ON ONE OCCASION READ ALOUD TWO CHAPTERS TO HIM. THE YOUNG MAN HAD LISTENED WITHOUT DISGUISING HIS BOREDOM, HAD RUDELY YAWNED, HAD VOUCHSAFED NO WORD OF PRAISE; BUT ON LEAVING HAD ASKED FOR THE MANUSCRIPT THAT HE MIGHT FORM AN OPINION OF IT AT HIS LEISURE, AND ANDREY ANTONOVITCH HAD GIVEN IT HIM. HE HAD NOT RETURNED THE MANUSCRIPT SINCE, THOUGH HE DROPPED IN EVERY DAY, AND HAD TURNED OFF ALL INQUIRIES WITH A LAUGH. AFTERWARDS HE DECLARED THAT HE HAD LOST IT IN THE STREET. AT THE TIME YULIA MIHAILOVNA WAS TERRIBLY ANGRY WITH HER HUSBAND WHEN SHE HEARD OF IT.

‚ÄÚPERHAPS YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT THE CHURCH TOO?‚ÄÙ SHE BURST OUT ALMOST IN DISMAY.

VON LEMBKE UNMISTAKABLY BEGAN TO BROOD, AND BROODING WAS BAD FOR HIM, AND HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN BY THE DOCTORS. APART FROM THE FACT THAT THERE WERE SIGNS OF TROUBLE IN THE PROVINCE, OF WHICH WE WILL SPEAK LATER, HE HAD PRIVATE REASONS FOR BROODING, HIS HEART WAS WOUNDED, NOT MERELY HIS OFFICIAL DIGNITY. WHEN ANDREY ANTONOVITCH HAD ENTERED UPON MARRIED LIFE, HE HAD NEVER CONCEIVED THE POSSIBILITY OF CONJUGAL STRIFE, OR DISSENSION IN THE FUTURE. IT WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE DREAMS HE HAD CHERISHED ALL HIS LIFE OF HIS MINNA OR ERNESTINE. HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNEQUAL TO ENDURING DOMESTIC STORMS. YULIA MIHAILOVNA HAD AN OPEN EXPLANATION WITH HIM AT LAST.

‚ÄÚYOU CAN‚ÄÔT BE ANGRY AT THIS,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID, ‚ÄÚIF ONLY BECAUSE YOU‚ÄÔVE STILL AS MUCH SENSE AS HE HAS, AND ARE IMMEASURABLY HIGHER IN THE SOCIAL SCALE. THE BOY STILL PRESERVES MANY TRACES OF HIS OLD FREE-THINKING HABITS; I BELIEVE IT‚ÄÔS SIMPLY MISCHIEF; BUT ONE CAN DO NOTHING SUDDENLY, IN A HURRY; YOU MUST DO THINGS BY DEGREES. WE MUST MAKE MUCH OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE; I TREAT THEM WITH AFFECTION AND HOLD THEM BACK FROM THE BRINK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT HE SAYS SUCH DREADFUL THINGS,‚ÄÙ VON LEMBKE OBJECTED. ‚ÄÚI CAN‚ÄÔT BEHAVE TOLERANTLY WHEN HE MAINTAINS IN MY PRESENCE AND BEFORE OTHER PEOPLE THAT THE GOVERNMENT PURPOSELY DRENCHES THE PEOPLE WITH VODKA IN ORDER TO BRUTALISE THEM, AND SO KEEP THEM FROM REVOLUTION. FANCY MY POSITION WHEN I‚ÄÔM FORCED TO LISTEN TO THAT BEFORE EVERY ONE.‚ÄÙ

AS HE SAID THIS, VON LEMBKE RECALLED A CONVERSATION HE HAD RECENTLY HAD WITH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. WITH THE INNOCENT OBJECT OF DISPLAYING HIS LIBERAL TENDENCIES HE HAD SHOWN HIM HIS OWN PRIVATE COLLECTION OF EVERY POSSIBLE KIND OF MANIFESTO, RUSSIAN AND FOREIGN, WHICH HE HAD CAREFULLY COLLECTED SINCE THE YEAR 1859, NOT SIMPLY FROM A LOVE OF COLLECTING BUT FROM A LAUDABLE INTEREST IN THEM. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, SEEING HIS OBJECT, EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT THERE WAS MORE SENSE IN ONE LINE OF SOME MANIFESTOES THAN IN A WHOLE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT, ‚ÄÚNOT EVEN EXCLUDING YOURS, MAYBE.‚ÄÙ

LEMBKE WINCED.

‚ÄÚBUT THIS IS PREMATURE AMONG US, PREMATURE,‚ÄÙ HE PRONOUNCED ALMOST IMPLORINGLY, POINTING TO THE MANIFESTOES.

‚ÄÚNO, IT‚ÄÔS NOT PREMATURE; YOU SEE YOU‚ÄÔRE AFRAID, SO IT‚ÄÔS NOT PREMATURE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT HERE, FOR INSTANCE, IS AN INCITEMENT TO DESTROY CHURCHES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND WHY NOT? YOU‚ÄÔRE A SENSIBLE MAN, AND OF COURSE YOU DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE IN IT YOURSELF, BUT YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT YOU NEED RELIGION TO BRUTALISE THE PEOPLE. TRUTH IS HONESTER THAN FALSEHOOD.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AGREE, I AGREE, I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU, BUT IT IS PREMATURE, PREMATURE IN THIS COUNTRY ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ SAID VON LEMBKE, FROWNING.

‚ÄÚAND HOW CAN YOU BE AN OFFICIAL OF THE GOVERNMENT AFTER THAT, WHEN YOU AGREE TO DEMOLISHING CHURCHES, AND MARCHING ON PETERSBURG ARMED WITH STAVES, AND MAKE IT ALL SIMPLY A QUESTION OF DATE?‚ÄÙ

LEMBKE WAS GREATLY PUT OUT AT BEING SO CRUDELY CAUGHT.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS NOT SO, NOT SO AT ALL,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, CARRIED AWAY AND MORE AND MORE MORTIFIED IN HIS AMOUR-PROPRE. ‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE YOUNG, AND KNOW NOTHING OF OUR AIMS, AND THAT‚ÄÔS WHY YOU‚ÄÔRE MISTAKEN. YOU SEE, MY DEAR PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, YOU CALL US OFFICIALS OF THE GOVERNMENT, DON‚ÄÔT YOU? INDEPENDENT OFFICIALS, DON‚ÄÔT YOU? BUT LET ME ASK YOU, HOW ARE WE ACTING? OURS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY, BUT IN THE LONG RUN WE SERVE THE CAUSE OF PROGRESS JUST AS YOU DO. WE ONLY HOLD TOGETHER WHAT YOU ARE UNSETTLING, AND WHAT, BUT FOR US, WOULD GO TO PIECES IN ALL DIRECTIONS. WE ARE NOT YOUR ENEMIES, NOT A BIT OF IT. WE SAY TO YOU, GO FORWARD, PROGRESS, YOU MAY EVEN UNSETTLE THINGS, THAT IS, THINGS THAT ARE ANTIQUATED AND IN NEED OF REFORM. BUT WE WILL KEEP YOU, WHEN NEED BE, WITHIN NECESSARY LIMITS, AND SO SAVE YOU FROM YOURSELVES, FOR WITHOUT US YOU WOULD SET RUSSIA TOTTERING, ROBBING HER OF ALL EXTERNAL DECENCY, WHILE OUR TASK IS TO PRESERVE EXTERNAL DECENCY. UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE MUTUALLY ESSENTIAL TO ONE ANOTHER. IN ENGLAND THE WHIGS AND TORIES ARE IN THE SAME WAY MUTUALLY ESSENTIAL TO ONE ANOTHER. WELL, YOU‚ÄÔRE WHIGS AND WE‚ÄÔRE TORIES. THAT‚ÄÔS HOW I LOOK AT IT.‚ÄÙ

ANDREY ANTONOVITCH ROSE TO POSITIVE ELOQUENCE. HE HAD BEEN FOND OF TALKING IN A LIBERAL AND INTELLECTUAL STYLE EVEN IN PETERSBURG, AND THE GREAT THING HERE WAS THAT THERE WAS NO ONE TO PLAY THE SPY ON HIM.

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS SILENT, AND MAINTAINED AN UNUSUALLY GRAVE AIR. THIS EXCITED THE ORATOR MORE THAN EVER.

‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW THAT I, THE ‚ÄÒPERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROVINCE,‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ HE WENT ON, WALKING ABOUT THE STUDY, ‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW I HAVE SO MANY DUTIES I CAN‚ÄÔT PERFORM ONE OF THEM, AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, I CAN SAY JUST AS TRULY THAT THERE‚ÄÔS NOTHING FOR ME TO DO HERE. THE WHOLE SECRET OF IT IS, THAT EVERYTHING DEPENDS UPON THE VIEWS OF THE GOVERNMENT. SUPPOSE THE GOVERNMENT WERE EVER TO FOUND A REPUBLIC, FROM POLICY, OR TO PACIFY PUBLIC EXCITEMENT, AND AT THE SAME TIME TO INCREASE THE POWER OF THE GOVERNORS, THEN WE GOVERNORS WOULD SWALLOW UP THE REPUBLIC; AND NOT THE REPUBLIC ONLY. ANYTHING YOU LIKE WE‚ÄÔLL SWALLOW UP. I, AT LEAST, FEEL THAT I AM READY. IN ONE WORD, IF THE GOVERNMENT DICTATES TO ME BY TELEGRAM, ACTIVIT√© D√©VORANTE, I‚ÄÔLL SUPPLY ACTIVIT√© D√©VORANTE. I‚ÄÔVE TOLD THEM HERE STRAIGHT IN THEIR FACES: ‚ÄÒDEAR SIRS, TO MAINTAIN THE EQUILIBRIUM AND TO DEVELOP ALL THE PROVINCIAL INSTITUTIONS ONE THING IS ESSENTIAL; THE INCREASE OF THE POWER OF THE GOVERNOR.‚ÄÔ YOU SEE IT‚ÄÔS NECESSARY THAT ALL THESE INSTITUTIONS, THE ZEMSTVOS, THE LAW-COURTS, SHOULD HAVE A TWO-FOLD EXISTENCE, THAT IS, ON THE ONE HAND, IT‚ÄÔS NECESSARY THEY SHOULD EXIST (I AGREE THAT IT IS NECESSARY), ON THE OTHER HAND, IT‚ÄÔS NECESSARY THAT THEY SHOULDN‚ÄÔT. IT‚ÄÔS ALL ACCORDING TO THE VIEWS OF THE GOVERNMENT. IF THE MOOD TAKES THEM SO THAT INSTITUTIONS SEEM SUDDENLY NECESSARY, I SHALL HAVE THEM AT ONCE IN READINESS. THE NECESSITY PASSES AND NO ONE WILL FIND THEM UNDER MY RULE. THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT I UNDERSTAND BY ACTIVIT√© D√©VORANTE, AND YOU CAN‚ÄÔT HAVE IT WITHOUT AN INCREASE OF THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS POWER. WE‚ÄÔRE TALKING T√™TE-√†-T√™TE. YOU KNOW I‚ÄÔVE ALREADY LAID BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT IN PETERSBURG THE NECESSITY OF A SPECIAL SENTINEL BEFORE THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS HOUSE. I‚ÄÔM AWAITING AN ANSWER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU OUGHT TO HAVE TWO,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH COMMENTED.

‚ÄÚWHY TWO?‚ÄÙ SAID VON LEMBKE, STOPPING SHORT BEFORE HIM.

‚ÄÚONE‚ÄÔS NOT ENOUGH TO CREATE RESPECT FOR YOU. YOU CERTAINLY OUGHT TO HAVE TWO.‚ÄÙ

ANDREY ANTONOVITCH MADE A WRY FACE.

‚ÄÚYOU ‚Ä¶ THERE‚ÄÔS NO LIMIT TO THE LIBERTIES YOU TAKE, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MY GOOD-NATURE, YOU SAY CUTTING THINGS, AND PLAY THE PART OF A BOURRU BIENFAISANT.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, THAT‚ÄÔS AS YOU PLEASE,‚ÄÙ MUTTERED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH; ‚ÄÚANYWAY YOU PAVE THE WAY FOR US AND PREPARE FOR OUR SUCCESS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOW, WHO ARE ‚ÄÒWE,‚ÄÔ AND WHAT SUCCESS?‚ÄÙ SAID VON LEMBKE, STARING AT HIM IN SURPRISE. BUT HE GOT NO ANSWER.

YULIA MIHAILOVNA, RECEIVING A REPORT OF THE CONVERSATION, WAS GREATLY DISPLEASED.

‚ÄÚBUT I CAN‚ÄÔT EXERCISE MY OFFICIAL AUTHORITY UPON YOUR FAVOURITE,‚ÄÙ ANDREY ANTONOVITCH PROTESTED IN SELF-DEFENCE, ‚ÄÚESPECIALLY WHEN WE‚ÄÔRE T√™TE-√†-T√™TE.‚Ä¶ I MAY SAY TOO MUCH ‚Ä¶ IN THE GOODNESS OF MY HEART.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFROM TOO MUCH GOODNESS OF HEART. I DIDN‚ÄÔT KNOW YOU‚ÄÔD GOT A COLLECTION OF MANIFESTOES. BE SO GOOD AS TO SHOW THEM TO ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT ‚Ä¶ HE ASKED TO HAVE THEM FOR ONE DAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND YOU‚ÄÔVE LET HIM HAVE THEM, AGAIN!‚ÄÙ CRIED YULIA MIHAILOVNA GETTING ANGRY. ‚ÄÚHOW TACTLESS!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL SEND SOMEONE TO HIM AT ONCE TO GET THEM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE WON‚ÄÔT GIVE THEM UP.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL INSIST ON IT,‚ÄÙ CRIED VON LEMBKE, BOILING OVER, AND HE JUMPED UP FROM HIS SEAT. ‚ÄÚWHO‚ÄÔS HE THAT WE SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF HIM, AND WHO AM I THAT I SHOULDN‚ÄÔT DARE TO DO ANY THING?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSIT DOWN AND CALM YOURSELF,‚ÄÙ SAID YULIA MIHAILOVNA, CHECKING HIM. ‚ÄÚI WILL ANSWER YOUR FIRST QUESTION. HE CAME TO ME WITH THE HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS. HE‚ÄÔS TALENTED, AND SOMETIMES SAYS EXTREMELY CLEVER THINGS. KARMAZINOV TELLS ME THAT HE HAS CONNECTIONS ALMOST EVERYWHERE, AND EXTRAORDINARY INFLUENCE OVER THE YOUNGER GENERATION IN PETERSBURG AND MOSCOW. AND IF THROUGH HIM I CAN ATTRACT THEM ALL AND GROUP THEM ROUND MYSELF, I SHALL BE SAVING THEM FROM PERDITION BY GUIDING THEM INTO A NEW OUTLET FOR THEIR AMBITIONS. HE‚ÄÔS DEVOTED TO ME WITH HIS WHOLE HEART AND IS GUIDED BY ME IN EVERYTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT WHILE THEY‚ÄÔRE BEING PETTED ‚Ä¶ THE DEVIL KNOWS WHAT THEY MAY NOT DO. OF COURSE, IT‚ÄÔS AN IDEA ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ SAID VON LEMBKE, VAGUELY DEFENDING HIMSELF, ‚ÄÚBUT ‚Ä¶ BUT HERE I‚ÄÔVE HEARD THAT MANIFESTOES OF SOME SORT HAVE BEEN FOUND IN X DISTRICT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT THERE WAS A RUMOUR OF THAT IN THE SUMMER‚ÄÎMANIFESTOES, FALSE BANK-NOTES, AND ALL THE REST OF IT, BUT THEY HAVEN‚ÄÔT FOUND ONE OF THEM SO FAR. WHO TOLD YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI HEARD IT FROM VON BLUM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAH, DON‚ÄÔT TALK TO ME OF YOUR BLUM. DON‚ÄÔT EVER DARE MENTION HIM AGAIN!‚ÄÙ

YULIA MIHAILOVNA FLEW INTO A RAGE, AND FOR A MOMENT COULD NOT SPEAK. VON BLUM WAS A CLERK IN THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS OFFICE WHOM SHE PARTICULARLY HATED. OF THAT LATER.

‚ÄÚPLEASE DON‚ÄÔT WORRY YOURSELF ABOUT VERHOVENSKY,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID IN CONCLUSION. ‚ÄÚIF HE HAD TAKEN PART IN ANY MISCHIEF HE WOULDN‚ÄÔT TALK AS HE DOES TO YOU, AND EVERY ONE ELSE HERE. TALKERS ARE NOT DANGEROUS, AND I WILL EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN I SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO HEAR OF IT THROUGH HIM. HE‚ÄÔS QUITE FANATICALLY DEVOTED TO ME.‚ÄÙ

I WILL OBSERVE, ANTICIPATING EVENTS THAT, HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS OBSTINACY AND SELF-CONCEIT, PROBABLY NOTHING OF ALL THE MISCHIEF THESE WRETCHED PEOPLE SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING ABOUT AMONGST US WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A GREAT DEAL.





CHAPTER V. ON THE EVE OF THE FETE

I

THE DATE OF THE F√™TE WHICH YULIA MIHAILOVNA WAS GETTING UP FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE GOVERNESSES OF OUR PROVINCE HAD BEEN SEVERAL TIMES FIXED AND PUT OFF. SHE HAD INVARIABLY BUSTLING ROUND HER PYOTR STEPANOVITCH AND A LITTLE CLERK, LYAMSHIN, WHO USED AT ONE TIME TO VISIT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, AND HAD SUDDENLY FOUND FAVOUR IN THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS HOUSE FOR THE WAY HE PLAYED THE PIANO AND NOW WAS OF USE RUNNING ERRANDS. LIPUTIN WAS THERE A GOOD DEAL TOO, AND YULIA MIHAILOVNA DESTINED HIM TO BE THE EDITOR OF A NEW INDEPENDENT PROVINCIAL PAPER. THERE WERE ALSO SEVERAL LADIES, MARRIED AND SINGLE, AND LASTLY, EVEN KARMAZINOV WHO, THOUGH HE COULD NOT BE SAID TO BUSTLE, ANNOUNCED ALOUD WITH A COMPLACENT AIR THAT HE WOULD AGREEABLY ASTONISH EVERY ONE WHEN THE LITERARY QUADRILLE BEGAN. AN EXTRAORDINARY MULTITUDE OF DONORS AND SUBSCRIBERS HAD TURNED UP, ALL THE SELECT SOCIETY OF THE TOWN; BUT EVEN THE UNSELECT WERE ADMITTED, IF ONLY THEY PRODUCED THE CASH. YULIA MIHAILOVNA OBSERVED THAT SOMETIMES IT WAS A POSITIVE DUTY TO ALLOW THE MIXING OF CLASSES, ‚ÄÚFOR OTHERWISE WHO IS TO ENLIGHTEN THEM?‚ÄÙ

A PRIVATE DRAWING-ROOM COMMITTEE WAS FORMED, AT WHICH IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE F√™TE WAS TO BE OF A DEMOCRATIC CHARACTER. THE ENORMOUS LIST OF SUBSCRIPTIONS TEMPTED THEM TO LAVISH EXPENDITURE. THEY WANTED TO DO SOMETHING ON A MARVELLOUS SCALE‚ÄÎTHAT‚ÄÔS WHY IT WAS PUT OFF. THEY WERE STILL UNDECIDED WHERE THE BALL WAS TO TAKE PLACE, WHETHER IN THE IMMENSE HOUSE BELONGING TO THE MARSHAL‚ÄÔS WIFE, WHICH SHE WAS WILLING TO GIVE UP TO THEM FOR THE DAY, OR AT VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS MANSION AT SKVORESHNIKI. IT WAS RATHER A DISTANCE TO SKVORESHNIKI, BUT MANY OF THE COMMITTEE WERE OF OPINION THAT IT WOULD BE ‚ÄÚFREER‚ÄÙ THERE. VARVARA PETROVNA WOULD DEARLY HAVE LIKED IT TO HAVE BEEN IN HER HOUSE. IT‚ÄÔS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS PROUD WOMAN SEEMED ALMOST MAKING UP TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA. PROBABLY WHAT PLEASED HER WAS THAT THE LATTER IN HER TURN SEEMED ALMOST FAWNING UPON NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH AND WAS MORE GRACIOUS TO HIM THAN TO ANYONE. I REPEAT AGAIN THAT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS ALWAYS, IN CONTINUAL WHISPERS, STRENGTHENING IN THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS HOUSEHOLD AN IDEA HE HAD INSINUATED THERE ALREADY, THAT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS A MAN WHO HAD VERY MYSTERIOUS CONNECTIONS WITH VERY MYSTERIOUS CIRCLES, AND THAT HE HAD CERTAINLY COME HERE WITH SOME COMMISSION FROM THEM.

PEOPLE HERE SEEMED IN A STRANGE STATE OF MIND AT THE TIME. AMONG THE LADIES ESPECIALLY A SORT OF FRIVOLITY WAS CONSPICUOUS, AND IT COULD NOT BE SAID TO BE A GRADUAL GROWTH. CERTAIN VERY FREE-AND-EASY NOTIONS SEEMED TO BE IN THE AIR. THERE WAS A SORT OF DISSIPATED GAIETY AND LEVITY, AND I CAN‚ÄÔT SAY IT WAS ALWAYS QUITE PLEASANT. A LAX WAY OF THINKING WAS THE FASHION. AFTERWARDS WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER, PEOPLE BLAMED YULIA MIHAILOVNA, HER CIRCLE, HER ATTITUDE. BUT IT CAN HARDLY HAVE BEEN ALTOGETHER DUE TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA. ON THE CONTRARY; AT FIRST MANY PEOPLE VIED WITH ONE ANOTHER IN PRAISING THE NEW GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS WIFE FOR HER SUCCESS IN BRINGING LOCAL SOCIETY TOGETHER, AND FOR MAKING THINGS MORE LIVELY. SEVERAL SCANDALOUS INCIDENTS TOOK PLACE, FOR WHICH YULIA MIHAILOVNA WAS IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE, BUT AT THE TIME PEOPLE WERE AMUSED AND DID NOTHING BUT LAUGH, AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO CHECK THEM. A RATHER LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE, IT IS TRUE, HELD THEMSELVES ALOOF, AND HAD VIEWS OF THEIR OWN ON THE COURSE OF EVENTS. BUT EVEN THESE MADE NO COMPLAINT AT THE TIME; THEY SMILED, IN FACT.

I REMEMBER THAT A FAIRLY LARGE CIRCLE CAME INTO EXISTENCE, AS IT WERE, SPONTANEOUSLY, THE CENTRE OF WHICH PERHAPS WAS REALLY TO BE FOUND IN YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS DRAWING-ROOM. IN THIS INTIMATE CIRCLE WHICH SURROUNDED HER, AMONG THE YOUNGER MEMBERS OF IT, OF COURSE, IT WAS CONSIDERED ADMISSIBLE TO PLAY ALL SORTS OF PRANKS, SOMETIMES RATHER FREE-AND-EASY ONES, AND, IN FACT, SUCH CONDUCT BECAME A PRINCIPLE AMONG THEM. IN THIS CIRCLE THERE WERE EVEN SOME VERY CHARMING LADIES. THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARRANGED PICNICS, AND EVEN PARTIES, AND SOMETIMES WENT ABOUT THE TOWN IN A REGULAR CAVALCADE, IN CARRIAGES AND ON HORSEBACK. THEY SOUGHT OUT ADVENTURES, EVEN GOT THEM UP THEMSELVES, SIMPLY FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING AN AMUSING STORY TO TELL. THEY TREATED OUR TOWN AS THOUGH IT WERE A SORT OF GLUPOV. PEOPLE CALLED THEM THE JEERERS OR SNEERERS, BECAUSE THEY DID NOT STICK AT ANYTHING. IT HAPPENED, FOR INSTANCE, THAT THE WIFE OF A LOCAL LIEUTENANT, A LITTLE BRUNETTE, VERY YOUNG THOUGH SHE LOOKED WORN OUT FROM HER HUSBAND‚ÄÔS ILL-TREATMENT, AT AN EVENING PARTY THOUGHTLESSLY SAT DOWN TO PLAY WHIST FOR HIGH STAKES IN THE FERVENT HOPE OF WINNING ENOUGH TO BUY HERSELF A MANTLE, AND INSTEAD OF WINNING, LOST FIFTEEN ROUBLES. BEING AFRAID OF HER HUSBAND, AND HAVING NO MEANS OF PAYING, SHE PLUCKED UP THE COURAGE OF FORMER DAYS AND VENTURED ON THE SLY TO ASK FOR A LOAN, ON THE SPOT, AT THE PARTY, FROM THE SON OF OUR MAYOR, A VERY NASTY YOUTH, PRECOCIOUSLY VICIOUS. THE LATTER NOT ONLY REFUSED IT, BUT WENT LAUGHING ALOUD TO TELL HER HUSBAND. THE LIEUTENANT, WHO CERTAINLY WAS POOR, WITH NOTHING BUT HIS SALARY, TOOK HIS WIFE HOME AND AVENGED HIMSELF UPON HER TO HIS HEART‚ÄÔS CONTENT IN SPITE OF HER SHRIEKS, WAILS, AND ENTREATIES ON HER KNEES FOR FORGIVENESS. THIS REVOLTING STORY EXCITED NOTHING BUT MIRTH ALL OVER THE TOWN, AND THOUGH THE POOR WIFE DID NOT BELONG TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS CIRCLE, ONE OF THE LADIES OF THE ‚ÄÚCAVALCADE,‚ÄÙ AN ECCENTRIC AND ADVENTUROUS CHARACTER WHO HAPPENED TO KNOW HER, DROVE ROUND, AND SIMPLY CARRIED HER OFF TO HER OWN HOUSE. HERE SHE WAS AT ONCE TAKEN UP BY OUR MADCAPS, MADE MUCH OF, LOADED WITH PRESENTS, AND KEPT FOR FOUR DAYS WITHOUT BEING SENT BACK TO HER HUSBAND. SHE STAYED AT THE ADVENTUROUS LADY‚ÄÔS ALL DAY LONG, DROVE ABOUT WITH HER AND ALL THE SPORTIVE COMPANY IN EXPEDITIONS ABOUT THE TOWN, AND TOOK PART IN DANCES AND MERRY-MAKING. THEY KEPT EGGING HER ON TO HAUL HER HUSBAND BEFORE THE COURT AND TO MAKE A SCANDAL. THEY DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD ALL SUPPORT HER AND WOULD COME AND BEAR WITNESS. THE HUSBAND KEPT QUIET, NOT DARING TO OPPOSE THEM. THE POOR THING REALISED AT LAST THAT SHE HAD GOT INTO A HOPELESS POSITION AND, MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE WITH FRIGHT, ON THE FOURTH DAY SHE RAN OFF IN THE DUSK FROM HER PROTECTORS TO HER LIEUTENANT. IT‚ÄÔS NOT DEFINITELY KNOWN WHAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE, BUT TWO SHUTTERS OF THE LOW-PITCHED LITTLE HOUSE IN WHICH THE LIEUTENANT LODGED WERE NOT OPENED FOR A FORTNIGHT. YULIA MIHAILOVNA WAS ANGRY WITH THE MISCHIEF-MAKERS WHEN SHE HEARD ABOUT IT ALL, AND WAS GREATLY DISPLEASED WITH THE CONDUCT OF THE ADVENTUROUS LADY, THOUGH THE LATTER HAD PRESENTED THE LIEUTENANT‚ÄÔS WIFE TO HER ON THE DAY SHE CARRIED HER OFF. HOWEVER, THIS WAS SOON FORGOTTEN.

ANOTHER TIME A PETTY CLERK, A RESPECTABLE HEAD OF A FAMILY, MARRIED HIS DAUGHTER, A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF SEVENTEEN, KNOWN TO EVERY ONE IN THE TOWN, TO ANOTHER PETTY CLERK, A YOUNG MAN WHO CAME FROM A DIFFERENT DISTRICT. BUT SUDDENLY IT WAS LEARNED THAT THE YOUNG HUSBAND HAD TREATED THE BEAUTY VERY ROUGHLY ON THE WEDDING NIGHT, CHASTISING HER FOR WHAT HE REGARDED AS A STAIN ON HIS HONOUR. LYAMSHIN, WHO WAS ALMOST A WITNESS OF THE AFFAIR, BECAUSE HE GOT DRUNK AT THE WEDDING AND SO STAYED THE NIGHT, AS SOON AS DAY DAWNED, RAN ROUND WITH THE DIVERTING INTELLIGENCE.

INSTANTLY A PARTY OF A DOZEN WAS MADE UP, ALL OF THEM ON HORSEBACK, SOME ON HIRED COSSACK HORSES, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, FOR INSTANCE, AND LIPUTIN, WHO, IN SPITE OF HIS GREY HAIRS, TOOK PART IN ALMOST EVERY SCANDALOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR RECKLESS YOUNGSTERS. WHEN THE YOUNG COUPLE APPEARED IN THE STREET IN A DROSHKY WITH A PAIR OF HORSES TO MAKE THE CALLS WHICH ARE OBLIGATORY IN OUR TOWN ON THE DAY AFTER A WEDDING, IN SPITE OF ANYTHING THAT MAY HAPPEN, THE WHOLE CAVALCADE, WITH MERRY LAUGHTER, SURROUNDED THE DROSHKY AND FOLLOWED THEM ABOUT THE TOWN ALL THE MORNING. THEY DID NOT, IT‚ÄÔS TRUE, GO INTO THE HOUSE, BUT WAITED FOR THEM OUTSIDE, ON HORSEBACK. THEY REFRAINED FROM MARKED INSULT TO THE BRIDE OR BRIDEGROOM, BUT STILL THEY CAUSED A SCANDAL. THE WHOLE TOWN BEGAN TALKING OF IT. EVERY ONE LAUGHED, OF COURSE. BUT AT THIS VON LEMBKE WAS ANGRY, AND AGAIN HAD A LIVELY SCENE WITH YULIA MIHAILOVNA. SHE, TOO, WAS EXTREMELY ANGRY, AND FORMED THE INTENTION OF TURNING THE SCAPEGRACES OUT OF HER HOUSE. BUT NEXT DAY SHE FORGAVE THEM ALL AFTER PERSUASIONS FROM PYOTR STEPANOVITCH AND SOME WORDS FROM KARMAZINOV, WHO CONSIDERED THE AFFAIR RATHER AMUSING.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS IN HARMONY WITH THE TRADITIONS OF THE PLACE,‚ÄÙ HE SAID. ‚ÄÚANYWAY IT‚ÄÔS CHARACTERISTIC AND ‚Ä¶ BOLD; AND LOOK, EVERY ONE‚ÄÔS LAUGHING, YOU‚ÄÔRE THE ONLY PERSON INDIGNANT.‚ÄÙ

BUT THERE WERE PRANKS OF A CERTAIN CHARACTER THAT WERE ABSOLUTELY PAST ENDURANCE.

A RESPECTABLE WOMAN OF THE ARTISAN CLASS, WHO WENT ABOUT SELLING GOSPELS, CAME INTO THE TOWN. PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT HER, BECAUSE SOME INTERESTING REFERENCES TO THESE GOSPEL WOMEN HAD JUST APPEARED IN THE PETERSBURG PAPERS. AGAIN THE SAME BUFFOON, LYAMSHIN, WITH THE HELP OF A DIVINITY STUDENT, WHO WAS TAKING A HOLIDAY WHILE WAITING FOR A POST IN THE SCHOOL, SUCCEEDED, ON THE PRETENCE OF BUYING BOOKS FROM THE GOSPEL WOMAN, IN THRUSTING INTO HER BAG A WHOLE BUNDLE OF INDECENT AND OBSCENE PHOTOGRAPHS FROM ABROAD, SACRIFICED EXPRESSLY FOR THE PURPOSE, AS WE LEARNED AFTERWARDS, BY A HIGHLY RESPECTABLE OLD GENTLEMAN (I WILL OMIT HIS NAME) WITH AN ORDER ON HIS BREAST, WHO, TO USE HIS OWN WORDS, LOVED ‚ÄÚA HEALTHY LAUGH AND A MERRY JEST.‚ÄÙ WHEN THE POOR WOMAN WENT TO TAKE OUT THE HOLY BOOKS IN THE BAZAAR, THE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLACE. THERE WERE ROARS OF LAUGHTER AND MURMURS OF INDIGNATION. A CROWD COLLECTED, BEGAN ABUSING HER, AND WOULD HAVE COME TO BLOWS IF THE POLICE HAD NOT ARRIVED IN THE NICK OF TIME. THE GOSPEL WOMAN WAS TAKEN TO THE LOCK-UP, AND ONLY IN THE EVENING, THANKS TO THE EFFORTS OF MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, WHO HAD LEARNED WITH INDIGNATION THE SECRET DETAILS OF THIS LOATHSOME AFFAIR, SHE WAS RELEASED AND ESCORTED OUT OF THE TOWN. AT THIS POINT YULIA MIHAILOVNA WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE FORBIDDEN LYAMSHIN HER HOUSE, BUT THAT VERY EVENING THE WHOLE CIRCLE BROUGHT HIM TO HER WITH THE INTELLIGENCE THAT HE HAD JUST COMPOSED A NEW PIECE FOR THE PIANO, AND PERSUADED HER AT LEAST TO HEAR IT. THE PIECE TURNED OUT TO BE REALLY AMUSING, AND BORE THE COMIC TITLE OF ‚ÄÚTHE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.‚ÄÙ IT BEGAN WITH THE MENACING STRAINS OF THE ‚ÄÚMARSEILLAISE‚ÄÙ:

‚ÄÚQU‚ÄÔUN SANG IMPUR ABREUVE NOS SILLONS.‚ÄÙ

THERE IS HEARD THE POMPOUS CHALLENGE, THE INTOXICATION OF FUTURE VICTORIES. BUT SUDDENLY MINGLING WITH THE MASTERLY VARIATIONS ON THE NATIONAL HYMN, SOMEWHERE FROM SOME CORNER QUITE CLOSE, ON ONE SIDE COME THE VULGAR STRAINS OF ‚ÄÚMEIN LIEBER AUGUSTIN.‚ÄÙ THE ‚ÄÚMARSEILLAISE‚ÄÙ GOES ON UNCONSCIOUS OF THEM. THE ‚ÄÚMARSEILLAISE‚ÄÙ IS AT THE CLIMAX OF ITS INTOXICATION WITH ITS OWN GRANDEUR; BUT AUGUSTIN GAINS STRENGTH; AUGUSTIN GROWS MORE AND MORE INSOLENT, AND SUDDENLY THE MELODY OF AUGUSTIN BEGINS TO BLEND WITH THE MELODY OF THE ‚ÄÚMARSEILLAISE.‚ÄÙ THE LATTER BEGINS, AS IT WERE, TO GET ANGRY; BECOMING AWARE OF AUGUSTIN AT LAST SHE TRIES TO FLING HIM OFF, TO BRUSH HIM ASIDE LIKE A TIRESOME INSIGNIFICANT FLY. BUT ‚ÄÚMEIN LIEBER AUGUSTIN‚ÄÙ HOLDS HIS GROUND FIRMLY, HE IS CHEERFUL AND SELF-CONFIDENT, HE IS GLEEFUL AND IMPUDENT, AND THE ‚ÄÚMARSEILLAISE‚ÄÙ SEEMS SUDDENLY TO BECOME TERRIBLY STUPID. SHE CAN NO LONGER CONCEAL HER ANGER AND MORTIFICATION; IT IS A WAIL OF INDIGNATION, TEARS, AND CURSES, WITH HANDS OUTSTRETCHED TO PROVIDENCE.

‚ÄÚPAS UN POUCE DE NOTRE TERRAIN; PAS UNE DE NOS FORTERESSES.‚ÄÙ

BUT SHE IS FORCED TO SING IN TIME WITH ‚ÄÚMEIN LIEBER AUGUSTIN.‚ÄÙ HER MELODY PASSES IN A SORT OF FOOLISH WAY INTO AUGUSTIN; SHE YIELDS AND DIES AWAY. AND ONLY BY SNATCHES THERE IS HEARD AGAIN:

‚ÄÚQU‚ÄÔUN SANG IMPUR ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

BUT AT ONCE IT PASSES VERY OFFENSIVELY INTO THE VULGAR WALTZ. SHE SUBMITS ALTOGETHER. IT IS JULES FAVRE SOBBING ON BISMARCK‚ÄÔS BOSOM AND SURRENDERING EVERY THING.‚Ä¶ BUT AT THIS POINT AUGUSTIN TOO GROWS FIERCE; HOARSE SOUNDS ARE HEARD; THERE IS A SUGGESTION OF COUNTLESS GALLONS OF BEER, OF A FRENZY OF SELF-GLORIFICATION, DEMANDS FOR MILLIONS, FOR FINE CIGARS, CHAMPAGNE, AND HOSTAGES. AUGUSTIN PASSES INTO A WILD YELL.‚Ä¶ ‚ÄÚTHE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR‚ÄÙ IS OVER. OUR CIRCLE APPLAUDED, YULIA MIHAILOVNA SMILED, AND SAID, ‚ÄÚNOW, HOW IS ONE TO TURN HIM OUT?‚ÄÙ PEACE WAS MADE. THE RASCAL REALLY HAD TALENT. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH ASSURED ME ON ONE OCCASION THAT THE VERY HIGHEST ARTISTIC TALENTS MAY EXIST IN THE MOST ABOMINABLE BLACKGUARDS, AND THAT THE ONE THING DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE OTHER. THERE WAS A RUMOUR AFTERWARDS THAT LYAMSHIN HAD STOLEN THIS BURLESQUE FROM A TALENTED AND MODEST YOUNG MAN OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE, WHOSE NAME REMAINED UNKNOWN. BUT THIS IS BESIDE THE MARK. THIS WORTHLESS FELLOW WHO HAD HUNG ABOUT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH FOR YEARS, WHO USED AT HIS EVENING PARTIES, WHEN INVITED, TO MIMIC JEWS OF VARIOUS TYPES, A DEAF PEASANT WOMAN MAKING HER CONFESSION, OR THE BIRTH OF A CHILD, NOW AT YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS CARICATURED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HIMSELF IN A KILLING WAY, UNDER THE TITLE OF ‚ÄÚA LIBERAL OF THE FORTIES.‚ÄÙ EVERYBODY SHOOK WITH LAUGHTER, SO THAT IN THE END IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN HIM OUT: HE HAD BECOME TOO NECESSARY A PERSON. BESIDES HE FAWNED UPON PYOTR STEPANOVITCH IN A SLAVISH WAY, AND HE, IN HIS TURN, HAD OBTAINED BY THIS TIME A STRANGE AND UNACCOUNTABLE INFLUENCE OVER YULIA MIHAILOVNA.

I WOULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS SCOUNDREL, AND, INDEED, HE WOULD NOT BE WORTH DWELLING UPON, BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER REVOLTING STORY, SO PEOPLE DECLARE, IN WHICH HE HAD A HAND, AND THIS STORY I CANNOT OMIT FROM MY RECORD.

ONE MORNING THE NEWS OF A HIDEOUS AND REVOLTING SACRILEGE WAS ALL OVER THE TOWN. AT THE ENTRANCE TO OUR IMMENSE MARKETPLACE THERE STANDS THE ANCIENT CHURCH OF OUR LADY‚ÄÔS NATIVITY, WHICH WAS A REMARKABLE ANTIQUITY IN OUR ANCIENT TOWN. AT THE GATES OF THE PRECINCTS THERE IS A LARGE IKON OF THE MOTHER OF GOD FIXED BEHIND A GRATING IN THE WALL. AND BEHOLD, ONE NIGHT THE IKON HAD BEEN ROBBED, THE GLASS OF THE CASE WAS BROKEN, THE GRATING WAS SMASHED AND SEVERAL STONES AND PEARLS (I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHETHER THEY WERE VERY PRECIOUS ONES) HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE CROWN AND THE SETTING. BUT WHAT WAS WORSE, BESIDES THE THEFT A SENSELESS, SCOFFING SACRILEGE HAD BEEN PERPETRATED. BEHIND THE BROKEN GLASS OF THE IKON THEY FOUND IN THE MORNING, SO IT WAS SAID, A LIVE MOUSE. NOW, FOUR MONTHS SINCE, IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BEYOND DOUBT THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY THE CONVICT FEDKA, BUT FOR SOME REASON IT IS ADDED THAT LYAMSHIN TOOK PART IN IT. AT THE TIME NO ONE SPOKE OF LYAMSHIN OR HAD ANY SUSPICION OF HIM. BUT NOW EVERY ONE SAYS IT WAS HE WHO PUT THE MOUSE THERE. I REMEMBER ALL OUR RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS WERE RATHER STAGGERED. A CROWD THRONGED ROUND THE SCENE OF THE CRIME FROM EARLY MORNING. THERE WAS A CROWD CONTINUALLY BEFORE IT, NOT A VERY HUGE ONE, BUT ALWAYS ABOUT A HUNDRED PEOPLE, SOME COMING AND SOME GOING. AS THEY APPROACHED THEY CROSSED THEMSELVES AND BOWED DOWN TO THE IKON. THEY BEGAN TO GIVE OFFERINGS, AND A CHURCH DISH MADE ITS APPEARANCE, AND WITH THE DISH A MONK. BUT IT WAS ONLY ABOUT THREE O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON IT OCCURRED TO THE AUTHORITIES THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO PROHIBIT THE CROWDS STANDING ABOUT, AND TO COMMAND THEM WHEN THEY HAD PRAYED, BOWED DOWN AND LEFT THEIR OFFERINGS, TO PASS ON. UPON VON LEMBKE THIS UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT MADE THE GLOOMIEST IMPRESSION. AS I WAS TOLD, YULIA MIHAILOVNA SAID AFTERWARDS IT WAS FROM THIS ILL-OMENED MORNING THAT SHE FIRST NOTICED IN HER HUSBAND THAT STRANGE DEPRESSION WHICH PERSISTED IN HIM UNTIL HE LEFT OUR PROVINCE ON ACCOUNT OF ILLNESS TWO MONTHS AGO, AND, I BELIEVE, HAUNTS HIM STILL IN SWITZERLAND, WHERE HE HAS GONE FOR A REST AFTER HIS BRIEF CAREER AMONGST US.

I REMEMBER AT ONE O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON I CROSSED THE MARKETPLACE; THE CROWD WAS SILENT AND THEIR FACES SOLEMN AND GLOOMY. A MERCHANT, FAT AND SALLOW, DROVE UP, GOT OUT OF HIS CARRIAGE, MADE A BOW TO THE GROUND, KISSED THE IKON, OFFERED A ROUBLE, SIGHING, GOT BACK INTO HIS CARRIAGE AND DROVE OFF. ANOTHER CARRIAGE DROVE UP WITH TWO LADIES ACCOMPANIED BY TWO OF OUR SCAPEGRACES. THE YOUNG PEOPLE (ONE OF WHOM WAS NOT QUITE YOUNG) GOT OUT OF THEIR CARRIAGE TOO, AND SQUEEZED THEIR WAY UP TO THE IKON, PUSHING PEOPLE ASIDE RATHER CARELESSLY. NEITHER OF THE YOUNG MEN TOOK OFF HIS HAT, AND ONE OF THEM PUT A PINCE-NEZ ON HIS NOSE. IN THE CROWD THERE WAS A MURMUR, VAGUE BUT UNFRIENDLY. THE DANDY WITH THE PINCE-NEZ TOOK OUT OF HIS PURSE, WHICH WAS STUFFED FULL OF BANK-NOTES, A COPPER FARTHING AND FLUNG IT INTO THE DISH. BOTH LAUGHED, AND, TALKING LOUDLY, WENT BACK TO THEIR CARRIAGE. AT THAT MOMENT LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA GALLOPED UP, ESCORTED BY MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH. SHE JUMPED OFF HER HORSE, FLUNG THE REINS TO HER COMPANION, WHO, AT HER BIDDING, REMAINED ON HIS HORSE, AND APPROACHED THE IKON AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THE FARTHING HAD BEEN FLUNG DOWN. A FLUSH OF INDIGNATION SUFFUSED HER CHEEKS; SHE TOOK OFF HER ROUND HAT AND HER GLOVES, FELL STRAIGHT ON HER KNEES BEFORE THE IKON ON THE MUDDY PAVEMENT, AND REVERENTLY BOWED DOWN THREE TIMES TO THE EARTH. THEN SHE TOOK OUT HER PURSE, BUT AS IT APPEARED SHE HAD ONLY A FEW SMALL COINS IN IT SHE INSTANTLY TOOK OFF HER DIAMOND EAR-RINGS AND PUT THEM IN THE DISH.

‚ÄÚMAY I? MAY I? FOR THE ADORNMENT OF THE SETTING?‚ÄÙ SHE ASKED THE MONK.

‚ÄÚIT IS PERMITTED,‚ÄÙ REPLIED THE LATTER, ‚ÄÚEVERY GIFT IS GOOD.‚ÄÙ THE CROWD WAS SILENT, EXPRESSING NEITHER DISSENT NOR APPROVAL.

LIZA GOT ON HER HORSE AGAIN, IN HER MUDDY RIDING-HABIT, AND GALLOPED AWAY.

II

TWO DAYS AFTER THE INCIDENT I HAVE DESCRIBED I MET HER IN A NUMEROUS COMPANY, WHO WERE DRIVING OUT ON SOME EXPEDITION IN THREE COACHES, SURROUNDED BY OTHERS ON HORSEBACK. SHE BECKONED TO ME, STOPPED HER CARRIAGE, AND PRESSINGLY URGED ME TO JOIN THEIR PARTY. A PLACE WAS FOUND FOR ME IN THE CARRIAGE, AND SHE LAUGHINGLY INTRODUCED ME TO HER COMPANIONS, GORGEOUSLY ATTIRED LADIES, AND EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THEY WERE ALL GOING ON A VERY INTERESTING EXPEDITION. SHE WAS LAUGHING, AND SEEMED SOMEWHAT EXCESSIVELY HAPPY. JUST LATELY SHE HAD BEEN VERY LIVELY, EVEN PLAYFUL, IN FACT.

THE EXPEDITION WAS CERTAINLY AN ECCENTRIC ONE. THEY WERE ALL GOING TO A HOUSE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER, TO THE MERCHANT SEVASTYANOV‚ÄÔS. IN THE LODGE OF THIS MERCHANT‚ÄÔS HOUSE OUR SAINT AND PROPHET, SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH, WHO WAS FAMOUS NOT ONLY AMONGST US BUT IN THE SURROUNDING PROVINCES AND EVEN IN PETERSBURG AND MOSCOW, HAD BEEN LIVING FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS, IN RETIREMENT, EASE, AND COMFORT. EVERY ONE WENT TO SEE HIM, ESPECIALLY VISITORS TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, EXTRACTING FROM HIM SOME CRAZY UTTERANCE, BOWING DOWN TO HIM, AND LEAVING AN OFFERING. THESE OFFERINGS WERE SOMETIMES CONSIDERABLE, AND IF SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH DID NOT HIMSELF ASSIGN THEM TO SOME OTHER PURPOSE WERE PIOUSLY SENT TO SOME CHURCH OR MORE OFTEN TO THE MONASTERY OF OUR LADY. A MONK FROM THE MONASTERY WAS ALWAYS IN WAITING UPON SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH WITH THIS OBJECT.

ALL WERE IN EXPECTATION OF GREAT AMUSEMENT. NO ONE OF THE PARTY HAD SEEN SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH BEFORE, EXCEPT LYAMSHIN, WHO DECLARED THAT THE SAINT HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT HE SHOULD BE DRIVEN OUT WITH A BROOM, AND HAD WITH HIS OWN HAND FLUNG TWO BIG BAKED POTATOES AFTER HIM. AMONG THE PARTY I NOTICED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, AGAIN RIDING A HIRED COSSACK HORSE, ON WHICH HE SAT EXTREMELY BADLY, AND NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, ALSO ON HORSEBACK. THE LATTER DID NOT ALWAYS HOLD ALOOF FROM SOCIAL DIVERSIONS, AND ON SUCH OCCASIONS ALWAYS WORE AN AIR OF GAIETY, ALTHOUGH, AS ALWAYS, HE SPOKE LITTLE AND SELDOM. WHEN OUR PARTY HAD CROSSED THE BRIDGE AND REACHED THE HOTEL OF THE TOWN, SOMEONE SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED THAT IN ONE OF THE ROOMS OF THE HOTEL THEY HAD JUST FOUND A TRAVELLER WHO HAD SHOT HIMSELF, AND WERE EXPECTING THE POLICE. AT ONCE THE SUGGESTION WAS MADE THAT THEY SHOULD GO AND LOOK AT THE SUICIDE. THE IDEA MET WITH APPROVAL: OUR LADIES HAD NEVER SEEN A SUICIDE. I REMEMBER ONE OF THEM SAID ALOUD ON THE OCCASION, ‚ÄÚEVERYTHING‚ÄÔS SO BORING, ONE CAN‚ÄÔT BE SQUEAMISH OVER ONE‚ÄÔS AMUSEMENTS, AS LONG AS THEY‚ÄÔRE INTERESTING.‚ÄÙ ONLY A FEW OF THEM REMAINED OUTSIDE. THE OTHERS WENT IN A BODY INTO THE DIRTY CORRIDOR, AND AMONGST THE OTHERS I SAW, TO MY AMAZEMENT, LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA. THE DOOR OF THE ROOM WAS OPEN, AND THEY DID NOT, OF COURSE, DARE TO PREVENT OUR GOING IN TO LOOK AT THE SUICIDE. HE WAS QUITE A YOUNG LAD, NOT MORE THAN NINETEEN. HE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD-LOOKING, WITH THICK FAIR HAIR, WITH A REGULAR OVAL FACE, AND A FINE, PURE FOREHEAD. THE BODY WAS ALREADY STIFF, AND HIS WHITE YOUNG FACE LOOKED LIKE MARBLE. ON THE TABLE LAY A NOTE, IN HIS HANDWRITING, TO THE EFFECT THAT NO ONE WAS TO BLAME FOR HIS DEATH, THAT HE HAD KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE HAD ‚ÄÚSQUANDERED‚ÄÙ FOUR HUNDRED ROUBLES. THE WORD ‚ÄÚSQUANDERED‚ÄÙ WAS USED IN THE LETTER; IN THE FOUR LINES OF HIS LETTER THERE WERE THREE MISTAKES IN SPELLING. A STOUT COUNTRY GENTLEMAN, EVIDENTLY A NEIGHBOUR, WHO HAD BEEN STAYING IN THE HOTEL ON SOME BUSINESS OF HIS OWN, WAS PARTICULARLY DISTRESSED ABOUT IT. FROM HIS WORDS IT APPEARED THAT THE BOY HAD BEEN SENT BY HIS FAMILY, THAT IS, A WIDOWED MOTHER, SISTERS, AND AUNTS, FROM THE COUNTRY TO THE TOWN IN ORDER THAT, UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A FEMALE RELATION IN THE TOWN, HE MIGHT PURCHASE AND TAKE HOME WITH HIM VARIOUS ARTICLES FOR THE TROUSSEAU OF HIS ELDEST SISTER, WHO WAS GOING TO BE MARRIED. THE FAMILY HAD, WITH SIGHS OF APPREHENSION, ENTRUSTED HIM WITH THE FOUR HUNDRED ROUBLES, THE SAVINGS OF TEN YEARS, AND HAD SENT HIM ON HIS WAY WITH EXHORTATIONS, PRAYERS, AND SIGNS OF THE CROSS. THE BOY HAD TILL THEN BEEN WELL-BEHAVED AND TRUSTWORTHY. ARRIVING THREE DAYS BEFORE AT THE TOWN, HE HAD NOT GONE TO HIS RELATIONS, HAD PUT UP AT THE HOTEL, AND GONE STRAIGHT TO THE CLUB IN THE HOPE OF FINDING IN SOME BACK ROOM A ‚ÄÚTRAVELLING BANKER,‚ÄÙ OR AT LEAST SOME GAME OF CARDS FOR MONEY. BUT THAT EVENING THERE WAS NO ‚ÄÚBANKER‚ÄÙ THERE OR GAMBLING GOING ON. GOING BACK TO THE HOTEL ABOUT MIDNIGHT HE ASKED FOR CHAMPAGNE, HAVANA CIGARS, AND ORDERED A SUPPER OF SIX OR SEVEN DISHES. BUT THE CHAMPAGNE MADE HIM DRUNK, AND THE CIGAR MADE HIM SICK, SO THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH THE FOOD WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT TO HIM, AND WENT TO BED ALMOST UNCONSCIOUS. WAKING NEXT MORNING AS FRESH AS AN APPLE, HE WENT AT ONCE TO THE GIPSIES‚ÄÔ CAMP, WHICH WAS IN A SUBURB BEYOND THE RIVER, AND OF WHICH HE HAD HEARD THE DAY BEFORE AT THE CLUB. HE DID NOT REAPPEAR AT THE HOTEL FOR TWO DAYS. AT LAST, AT FIVE O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON OF THE PREVIOUS DAY, HE HAD RETURNED DRUNK, HAD AT ONCE GONE TO BED, AND HAD SLEPT TILL TEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE EVENING. ON WAKING UP HE HAD ASKED FOR A CUTLET, A BOTTLE OF CHATEAU D‚ÄÔYQUEM, AND SOME GRAPES, PAPER, AND INK, AND HIS BILL. NO ONE NOTICED ANYTHING SPECIAL ABOUT HIM; HE WAS QUIET, GENTLE, AND FRIENDLY. HE MUST HAVE SHOT HIMSELF AT ABOUT MIDNIGHT, THOUGH IT WAS STRANGE THAT NO ONE HAD HEARD THE SHOT, AND THEY ONLY RAISED THE ALARM AT MIDDAY, WHEN, AFTER KNOCKING IN VAIN, THEY HAD BROKEN IN THE DOOR. THE BOTTLE OF CHATEAU D‚ÄÔYQUEM WAS HALF EMPTY, THERE WAS HALF A PLATEFUL OF GRAPES LEFT TOO. THE SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED FROM A LITTLE THREE-CHAMBERED REVOLVER, STRAIGHT INTO THE HEART. VERY LITTLE BLOOD HAD FLOWED. THE REVOLVER HAD DROPPED FROM HIS HAND ON TO THE CARPET. THE BOY HIMSELF WAS HALF LYING IN A CORNER OF THE SOFA. DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN INSTANTANEOUS. THERE WAS NO TRACE OF THE ANGUISH OF DEATH IN THE FACE; THE EXPRESSION WAS SERENE, ALMOST HAPPY, AS THOUGH THERE WERE NO CARES IN HIS LIFE. ALL OUR PARTY STARED AT HIM WITH GREEDY CURIOSITY. IN EVERY MISFORTUNE OF ONE‚ÄÔS NEIGHBOUR THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING CHEERING FOR AN ONLOOKER‚ÄÎWHOEVER HE MAY BE. OUR LADIES GAZED IN SILENCE, THEIR COMPANIONS DISTINGUISHED THEMSELVES BY THEIR WIT AND THEIR SUPERB EQUANIMITY. ONE OBSERVED THAT HIS WAS THE BEST WAY OUT OF IT, AND THAT THE BOY COULD NOT HAVE HIT UPON ANYTHING MORE SENSIBLE; ANOTHER OBSERVED THAT HE HAD HAD A GOOD TIME IF ONLY FOR A MOMENT. A THIRD SUDDENLY BLURTED OUT THE INQUIRY WHY PEOPLE HAD BEGUN HANGING AND SHOOTING THEMSELVES AMONG US OF LATE, AS THOUGH THEY HAD SUDDENLY LOST THEIR ROOTS, AS THOUGH THE GROUND WERE GIVING WAY UNDER EVERY ONE‚ÄÔS FEET. PEOPLE LOOKED COLDLY AT THIS RAISONNEUR. THEN LYAMSHIN, WHO PRIDED HIMSELF ON PLAYING THE FOOL, TOOK A BUNCH OF GRAPES FROM THE PLATE; ANOTHER, LAUGHING, FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE, AND A THIRD STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND FOR THE CHATEAU D‚ÄÔYQUEM. BUT THE HEAD OF POLICE ARRIVING CHECKED HIM, AND EVEN ORDERED THAT THE ROOM SHOULD BE CLEARED. AS EVERY ONE HAD SEEN ALL THEY WANTED THEY WENT OUT WITHOUT DISPUTING, THOUGH LYAMSHIN BEGAN PESTERING THE POLICE CAPTAIN ABOUT SOMETHING. THE GENERAL MERRYMAKING, LAUGHTER, AND PLAYFUL TALK WERE TWICE AS LIVELY ON THE LATTER HALF OF THE WAY.

WE ARRIVED AT SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH‚ÄÔS JUST AT ONE O‚ÄÔCLOCK. THE GATE OF THE RATHER LARGE HOUSE STOOD UNFASTENED, AND THE APPROACH TO THE LODGE WAS OPEN. WE LEARNT AT ONCE THAT SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH WAS DINING, BUT WAS RECEIVING GUESTS. THE WHOLE CROWD OF US WENT IN. THE ROOM IN WHICH THE SAINT DINED AND RECEIVED VISITORS HAD THREE WINDOWS, AND WAS FAIRLY LARGE. IT WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS BY A WOODEN LATTICE-WORK PARTITION, WHICH RAN FROM WALL TO WALL, AND WAS THREE OR FOUR FEET HIGH. ORDINARY VISITORS REMAINED ON THE OUTSIDE OF THIS PARTITION, BUT LUCKY ONES WERE BY THE SAINT‚ÄÔS INVITATION ADMITTED THROUGH THE PARTITION DOORS INTO HIS HALF OF THE ROOM. AND IF SO DISPOSED HE MADE THEM SIT DOWN ON THE SOFA OR ON HIS OLD LEATHER CHAIRS. HE HIMSELF INVARIABLY SAT IN AN OLD-FASHIONED SHABBY VOLTAIRE ARM-CHAIR. HE WAS A RATHER BIG, BLOATED-LOOKING, YELLOW-FACED MAN OF FIVE AND FIFTY, WITH A BALD HEAD AND SCANTY FLAXEN HAIR. HE WORE NO BEARD; HIS RIGHT CHEEK WAS SWOLLEN, AND HIS MOUTH SEEMED SOMEHOW TWISTED AWRY. HE HAD A LARGE WART ON THE LEFT SIDE OF HIS NOSE; NARROW EYES, AND A CALM, STOLID, SLEEPY EXPRESSION. HE WAS DRESSED IN EUROPEAN STYLE, IN A BLACK COAT, BUT HAD NO WAISTCOAT OR TIE. A RATHER COARSE, BUT WHITE SHIRT, PEEPED OUT BELOW HIS COAT. THERE WAS SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH HIS FEET, I BELIEVE, AND HE KEPT THEM IN SLIPPERS. I‚ÄÔVE HEARD THAT HE HAD AT ONE TIME BEEN A CLERK, AND RECEIVED A RANK IN THE SERVICE. HE HAD JUST FINISHED SOME FISH SOUP, AND WAS BEGINNING HIS SECOND DISH OF POTATOES IN THEIR SKINS, EATEN WITH SALT. HE NEVER ATE ANYTHING ELSE, BUT HE DRANK A GREAT DEAL OF TEA, OF WHICH HE WAS VERY FOND. THREE SERVANTS PROVIDED BY THE MERCHANT WERE RUNNING TO AND FRO ABOUT HIM. ONE OF THEM WAS IN A SWALLOW-TAIL, THE SECOND LOOKED LIKE A WORKMAN, AND THE THIRD LIKE A VERGER. THERE WAS ALSO A VERY LIVELY BOY OF SIXTEEN. BESIDES THE SERVANTS THERE WAS PRESENT, HOLDING A JUG, A REVEREND, GREY-HEADED MONK, WHO WAS A LITTLE TOO FAT. ON ONE OF THE TABLES A HUGE SAMOVAR WAS BOILING, AND A TRAY WITH ALMOST TWO DOZEN GLASSES WAS STANDING NEAR IT. ON ANOTHER TABLE OPPOSITE OFFERINGS HAD BEEN PLACED: SOME LOAVES AND ALSO SOME POUNDS OF SUGAR, TWO POUNDS OF TEA, A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED SLIPPERS, A FOULARD HANDKERCHIEF, A LENGTH OF CLOTH, A PIECE OF LINEN, AND SO ON. MONEY OFFERINGS ALMOST ALL WENT INTO THE MONK‚ÄÔS JUG. THE ROOM WAS FULL OF PEOPLE, AT LEAST A DOZEN VISITORS, OF WHOM TWO WERE SITTING WITH SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARTITION. ONE WAS A GREY-HEADED OLD PILGRIM OF THE PEASANT CLASS, AND THE OTHER A LITTLE, DRIED-UP MONK, WHO SAT DEMURELY, WITH HIS EYES CAST DOWN. THE OTHER VISITORS WERE ALL STANDING ON THE NEAR SIDE OF THE PARTITION, AND WERE MOSTLY, TOO, OF THE PEASANT CLASS, EXCEPT ONE ELDERLY AND POVERTY-STRICKEN LADY, ONE LANDOWNER, AND A STOUT MERCHANT, WHO HAD COME FROM THE DISTRICT TOWN, A MAN WITH A BIG BEARD, DRESSED IN THE RUSSIAN STYLE, THOUGH HE WAS KNOWN TO BE WORTH A HUNDRED THOUSAND.

ALL WERE WAITING FOR THEIR CHANCE, NOT DARING TO SPEAK OF THEMSELVES. FOUR WERE ON THEIR KNEES, BUT THE ONE WHO ATTRACTED MOST ATTENTION WAS THE LANDOWNER, A STOUT MAN OF FORTY-FIVE, KNEELING RIGHT AT THE PARTITION, MORE CONSPICUOUS THAN ANY ONE, WAITING REVERENTLY FOR A PROPITIOUS WORD OR LOOK FROM SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH. HE HAD BEEN THERE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR ALREADY, BUT THE SAINT STILL DID NOT NOTICE HIM.

OUR LADIES CROWDED RIGHT UP TO THE PARTITION, WHISPERING GAILY AND LAUGHINGLY TOGETHER. THEY PUSHED ASIDE OR GOT IN FRONT OF ALL THE OTHER VISITORS, EVEN THOSE ON THEIR KNEES, EXCEPT THE LANDOWNER, WHO REMAINED OBSTINATELY IN HIS PROMINENT POSITION EVEN HOLDING ON TO THE PARTITION. MERRY AND GREEDILY INQUISITIVE EYES WERE TURNED UPON SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH, AS WELL AS LORGNETTES, PINCE-NEZ, AND EVEN OPERA-GLASSES. LYAMSHIN, AT ANY RATE, LOOKED THROUGH AN OPERA-GLASS. SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH CALMLY AND LAZILY SCANNED ALL WITH HIS LITTLE EYES.

‚ÄÚMILOVZORS! MILOVZORS!‚ÄÙ HE DEIGNED TO PRONOUNCE, IN A HOARSE BASS, AND SLIGHTLY STACCATO.

ALL OUR PARTY LAUGHED: ‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THE MEANING OF ‚ÄÒMILOVZORS‚ÄÔ?‚ÄÙ BUT SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH RELAPSED INTO SILENCE, AND FINISHED HIS POTATOES. PRESENTLY HE WIPED HIS LIPS WITH HIS NAPKIN, AND THEY HANDED HIM TEA.

AS A RULE, HE DID NOT TAKE TEA ALONE, BUT POURED OUT SOME FOR HIS VISITORS, BUT BY NO MEANS FOR ALL, USUALLY POINTING HIMSELF TO THOSE HE WISHED TO HONOUR. AND HIS CHOICE ALWAYS SURPRISED PEOPLE BY ITS UNEXPECTEDNESS. PASSING BY THE WEALTHY AND THE HIGH-PLACED, HE SOMETIMES PITCHED UPON A PEASANT OR SOME DECREPIT OLD WOMAN. ANOTHER TIME HE WOULD PASS OVER THE BEGGARS TO HONOUR SOME FAT WEALTHY MERCHANT. TEA WAS SERVED DIFFERENTLY, TOO, TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE, SUGAR WAS PUT INTO SOME OF THE GLASSES AND HANDED SEPARATELY WITH OTHERS, WHILE SOME GOT IT WITHOUT ANY SUGAR AT ALL. THIS TIME THE FAVOURED ONE WAS THE MONK SITTING BY HIM, WHO HAD SUGAR PUT IN; AND THE OLD PILGRIM, TO WHOM IT WAS GIVEN WITHOUT ANY SUGAR. THE FAT MONK WITH THE JUG, FROM THE MONASTERY, FOR SOME REASON HAD NONE HANDED TO HIM AT ALL, THOUGH UP TILL THEN HE HAD HAD HIS GLASS EVERY DAY.

‚ÄÚSEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH, DO SAY SOMETHING TO ME. I‚ÄÔVE BEEN LONGING TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE FOR EVER SO LONG,‚ÄÙ CAROLLED THE GORGEOUSLY DRESSED LADY FROM OUR CARRIAGE, SCREWING UP HER EYES AND SMILING. SHE WAS THE LADY WHO HAD OBSERVED THAT ONE MUST NOT BE SQUEAMISH ABOUT ONE‚ÄÔS AMUSEMENTS, SO LONG AS THEY WERE INTERESTING. SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH DID NOT EVEN LOOK AT HER. THE KNEELING LANDOWNER UTTERED A DEEP, SONOROUS SIGH, LIKE THE SOUND OF A BIG PAIR OF BELLOWS.

‚ÄÚWITH SUGAR IN IT!‚ÄÙ SAID SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH SUDDENLY, POINTING TO THE WEALTHY MERCHANT. THE LATTER MOVED FORWARD AND STOOD BESIDE THE KNEELING GENTLEMAN.

‚ÄÚSOME MORE SUGAR FOR HIM!‚ÄÙ ORDERED SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH, AFTER THE GLASS HAD ALREADY BEEN POURED OUT. THEY PUT SOME MORE IN. ‚ÄÚMORE, MORE, FOR HIM!‚ÄÙ MORE WAS PUT IN A THIRD TIME, AND AGAIN A FOURTH. THE MERCHANT BEGAN SUBMISSIVELY DRINKING HIS SYRUP.

‚ÄÚHEAVENS!‚ÄÙ WHISPERED THE PEOPLE, CROSSING THEMSELVES. THE KNEELING GENTLEMAN AGAIN HEAVED A DEEP, SONOROUS SIGH.

‚ÄÚFATHER! SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH!‚ÄÙ THE VOICE OF THE POOR LADY RANG OUT ALL AT ONCE PLAINTIVELY, THOUGH SO SHARPLY THAT IT WAS STARTLING. OUR PARTY HAD SHOVED HER BACK TO THE WALL. ‚ÄÚA WHOLE HOUR, DEAR FATHER, I‚ÄÔVE BEEN WAITING FOR GRACE. SPEAK TO ME. CONSIDER MY CASE IN MY HELPLESSNESS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚASK HER,‚ÄÙ SAID SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH TO THE VERGER, WHO WENT TO THE PARTITION.

‚ÄÚHAVE YOU DONE WHAT SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH BADE YOU LAST TIME?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED THE WIDOW IN A SOFT AND MEASURED VOICE.

‚ÄÚDONE IT! FATHER SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH. HOW CAN ONE DO IT WITH THEM?‚ÄÙ WAILED THE WIDOW. ‚ÄÚTHEY‚ÄÔRE CANNIBALS; THEY‚ÄÔRE LODGING A COMPLAINT AGAINST ME, IN THE COURT; THEY THREATEN TO TAKE IT TO THE SENATE. THAT‚ÄÔS HOW THEY TREAT THEIR OWN MOTHER!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGIVE HER!‚ÄÙ SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH POINTED TO A SUGAR-LOAF. THE BOY SKIPPED UP, SEIZED THE SUGAR-LOAF AND DRAGGED IT TO THE WIDOW.

‚ÄÚACH, FATHER; GREAT IS YOUR MERCIFUL KINDNESS. WHAT AM I TO DO WITH SO MUCH?‚ÄÙ WAILED THE WIDOW.

‚ÄÚMORE, MORE,‚ÄÙ SAID SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH LAVISHLY.

THEY DRAGGED HER ANOTHER SUGAR-LOAF. ‚ÄÚMORE, MORE!‚ÄÙ THE SAINT COMMANDED. THEY TOOK HER A THIRD, AND FINALLY A FOURTH. THE WIDOW WAS SURROUNDED WITH SUGAR ON ALL SIDES. THE MONK FROM THE MONASTERY SIGHED; ALL THIS MIGHT HAVE GONE TO THE MONASTERY THAT DAY AS IT HAD DONE ON FORMER OCCASIONS.

‚ÄÚWHAT AM I TO DO WITH SO MUCH,‚ÄÙ THE WIDOW SIGHED OBSEQUIOUSLY. ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE PERSON SICK!‚Ä¶ IS IT SOME SORT OF A PROPHECY, FATHER?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBE SURE IT‚ÄÔS BY WAY OF A PROPHECY,‚ÄÙ SAID SOMEONE IN THE CROWD.

‚ÄÚANOTHER POUND FOR HER, ANOTHER!‚ÄÙ SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH PERSISTED.

THERE WAS A WHOLE SUGAR-LOAF STILL ON THE TABLE, BUT THE SAINT ORDERED A POUND TO BE GIVEN, AND THEY GAVE HER A POUND.

‚ÄÚLORD HAVE MERCY ON US!‚ÄÙ GASPED THE PEOPLE, CROSSING THEMSELVES. ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS SURELY A PROPHECY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSWEETEN YOUR HEART FOR THE FUTURE WITH MERCY AND LOVING KINDNESS, AND THEN COME TO MAKE COMPLAINTS AGAINST YOUR OWN CHILDREN; BONE OF YOUR BONE. THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT WE MUST TAKE THIS EMBLEM TO MEAN,‚ÄÙ THE STOUT MONK FROM THE MONASTERY, WHO HAD HAD NO TEA GIVEN TO HIM, SAID SOFTLY BUT SELF-COMPLACENTLY, TAKING UPON HIMSELF THE R√¥LE OF INTERPRETER IN AN ACCESS OF WOUNDED VANITY.

‚ÄÚWHAT ARE YOU SAYING, FATHER?‚ÄÙ CRIED THE WIDOW, SUDDENLY INFURIATED. ‚ÄÚWHY, THEY DRAGGED ME INTO THE FIRE WITH A ROPE ROUND ME WHEN THE VERHISHINS‚ÄÔ HOUSE WAS BURNT, AND THEY LOCKED UP A DEAD CAT IN MY CHEST. THEY ARE READY TO DO ANY VILLAINY.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAWAY WITH HER! AWAY WITH HER!‚ÄÙ SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH SAID SUDDENLY, WAVING HIS HANDS.

THE VERGER AND THE BOY DASHED THROUGH THE PARTITION. THE VERGER TOOK THE WIDOW BY THE ARM, AND WITHOUT RESISTING SHE TRAILED TO THE DOOR, KEEPING HER EYES FIXED ON THE LOAVES OF SUGAR THAT HAD BEEN BESTOWED ON HER, WHICH THE BOY DRAGGED AFTER HER.

‚ÄÚONE TO BE TAKEN AWAY. TAKE IT AWAY,‚ÄÙ SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH COMMANDED TO THE SERVANT LIKE A WORKMAN, WHO REMAINED WITH HIM. THE LATTER RUSHED AFTER THE RETREATING WOMAN, AND THE THREE SERVANTS RETURNED SOMEWHAT LATER BRINGING BACK ONE LOAF OF SUGAR WHICH HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO THE WIDOW AND NOW TAKEN AWAY FROM HER. SHE CARRIED OFF THREE, HOWEVER.

‚ÄÚSEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH,‚ÄÙ SAID A VOICE AT THE DOOR. ‚ÄÚI DREAMT OF A BIRD, A JACKDAW; IT FLEW OUT OF THE WATER AND FLEW INTO THE FIRE. WHAT DOES THE DREAM MEAN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFROST,‚ÄÙ SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH PRONOUNCED.

‚ÄÚSEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH, WHY DON‚ÄÔT YOU ANSWER ME ALL THIS TIME? I‚ÄÔVE BEEN INTERESTED IN YOU EVER SO LONG,‚ÄÙ THE LADY OF OUR PARTY BEGAN AGAIN.

‚ÄÚASK HIM!‚ÄÙ SAID SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH, NOT HEEDING HER, BUT POINTING TO THE KNEELING GENTLEMAN.

THE MONK FROM THE MONASTERY TO WHOM THE ORDER WAS GIVEN MOVED SEDATELY TO THE KNEELING FIGURE.

‚ÄÚHOW HAVE YOU SINNED? AND WAS NOT SOME COMMAND LAID UPON YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOT TO FIGHT; NOT TO GIVE THE REIN TO MY HANDS,‚ÄÙ ANSWERED THE KNEELING GENTLEMAN HOARSELY.

‚ÄÚHAVE YOU OBEYED?‚ÄÙ ASKED THE MONK.

‚ÄÚI CANNOT OBEY. MY OWN STRENGTH GETS THE BETTER OF ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAWAY WITH HIM, AWAY WITH HIM! WITH A BROOM, WITH A BROOM!‚ÄÙ CRIED SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH, WAVING HIS HANDS. THE GENTLEMAN RUSHED OUT OF THE ROOM WITHOUT WAITING FOR THIS PENALTY.

‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS LEFT A GOLD PIECE WHERE HE KNELT,‚ÄÙ OBSERVED THE MONK, PICKING UP A HALF-IMPERIAL.

‚ÄÚFOR HIM!‚ÄÙ SAID THE SAINT, POINTING TO THE RICH MERCHANT. THE LATTER DARED NOT REFUSE IT, AND TOOK IT.

‚ÄÚGOLD TO GOLD,‚ÄÙ THE MONK FROM THE MONASTERY COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SAYING.

‚ÄÚAND GIVE HIM SOME WITH SUGAR IN IT,‚ÄÙ SAID THE SAINT, POINTING TO MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH. THE SERVANT POURED OUT THE TEA AND TOOK IT BY MISTAKE TO THE DANDY WITH THE PINCE-NEZ.

‚ÄÚTHE LONG ONE, THE LONG ONE!‚ÄÙ SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH CORRECTED HIM.

MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH TOOK THE GLASS, MADE A MILITARY HALF-BOW, AND BEGAN DRINKING IT. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHY, BUT ALL OUR PARTY BURST INTO PEALS OF LAUGHTER.

‚ÄÚMAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH,‚ÄÙ CRIED LIZA, ADDRESSING HIM SUDDENLY. ‚ÄÚTHAT KNEELING GENTLEMAN HAS GONE AWAY. YOU KNEEL DOWN IN HIS PLACE.‚ÄÙ

MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH LOOKED AT HER IN AMAZEMENT.

‚ÄÚI BEG YOU TO. YOU‚ÄÔLL DO ME THE GREATEST FAVOUR. LISTEN, MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH,‚ÄÙ SHE WENT ON, SPEAKING IN AN EMPHATIC, OBSTINATE, EXCITED, AND RAPID VOICE. ‚ÄÚYOU MUST KNEEL DOWN; I MUST SEE YOU KNEEL DOWN. IF YOU WON‚ÄÔT, DON‚ÄÔT COME NEAR ME. I INSIST, I INSIST!‚ÄÙ

I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT SHE MEANT BY IT; BUT SHE INSISTED UPON IT RELENTLESSLY, AS THOUGH SHE WERE IN A FIT. MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, AS WE SHALL SEE LATER, SET DOWN THESE CAPRICIOUS IMPULSES, WHICH HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY FREQUENT OF LATE, TO OUTBREAKS OF BLIND HATRED FOR HIM, NOT DUE TO SPITE, FOR, ON THE CONTRARY, SHE ESTEEMED HIM, LOVED HIM, AND RESPECTED HIM, AND HE KNEW THAT HIMSELF‚ÄÎBUT FROM A PECULIAR UNCONSCIOUS HATRED WHICH AT TIMES SHE COULD NOT CONTROL.

IN SILENCE HE GAVE HIS CUP TO AN OLD WOMAN STANDING BEHIND HIM, OPENED THE DOOR OF THE PARTITION, AND, WITHOUT BEING INVITED, STEPPED INTO SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH‚ÄÔS PRIVATE APARTMENT, AND KNELT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM IN SIGHT OF ALL. I IMAGINE THAT HE WAS DEEPLY SHOCKED IN HIS CANDID AND DELICATE HEART BY LIZA‚ÄÔS COARSE AND MOCKING FREAK BEFORE THE WHOLE COMPANY. PERHAPS HE IMAGINED THAT SHE WOULD FEEL ASHAMED OF HERSELF, SEEING HIS HUMILIATION, ON WHICH SHE HAD SO INSISTED. OF COURSE NO ONE BUT HE WOULD HAVE DREAMT OF BRINGING A WOMAN TO REASON BY SO NA√ØVE AND RISKY A PROCEEDING. HE REMAINED KNEELING WITH HIS IMPERTURBABLE GRAVITY‚ÄÎLONG, TALL, AWKWARD, AND RIDICULOUS. BUT OUR PARTY DID NOT LAUGH. THE UNEXPECTEDNESS OF THE ACTION PRODUCED A PAINFUL SHOCK. EVERY ONE LOOKED AT LIZA.

‚ÄÚANOINT, ANOINT!‚ÄÙ MUTTERED SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH.

LIZA SUDDENLY TURNED WHITE, CRIED OUT, AND RUSHED THROUGH THE PARTITION. THEN A RAPID AND HYSTERICAL SCENE FOLLOWED. SHE BEGAN PULLING MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH UP WITH ALL HER MIGHT, TUGGING AT HIS ELBOWS WITH BOTH HANDS.

‚ÄÚGET UP! GET UP!‚ÄÙ SHE SCREAMED, AS THOUGH SHE WERE CRAZY. ‚ÄÚGET UP AT ONCE, AT ONCE. HOW DARE YOU?‚ÄÙ

MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH GOT UP FROM HIS KNEES. SHE CLUTCHED HIS ARMS ABOVE THE ELBOW AND LOOKED INTENTLY INTO HIS FACE. THERE WAS TERROR IN HER EXPRESSION.

‚ÄÚMILOVZORS! MILOVZORS!‚ÄÙ SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH REPEATED AGAIN.

SHE DRAGGED MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH BACK TO THE OTHER PART OF THE ROOM AT LAST. THERE WAS SOME COMMOTION IN ALL OUR COMPANY. THE LADY FROM OUR CARRIAGE, PROBABLY INTENDING TO RELIEVE THE SITUATION, LOUDLY AND SHRILLY ASKED THE SAINT FOR THE THIRD TIME, WITH AN AFFECTED SMILE:

‚ÄÚWELL, SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH, WON‚ÄÔT YOU UTTER SOME SAYING FOR ME? I‚ÄÔVE BEEN RECKONING SO MUCH ON YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOUT WITH THE ‚ÄÎ‚ÄÎ, OUT WITH THE ‚ÄÎ‚ÄÎ,‚ÄÙ SAID SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH, SUDDENLY ADDRESSING HER, WITH AN EXTREMELY INDECENT WORD. THE WORDS WERE UTTERED SAVAGELY, AND WITH HORRIFYING DISTINCTNESS. OUR LADIES SHRIEKED, AND RUSHED HEADLONG AWAY, WHILE THE GENTLEMEN ESCORTING THEM BURST INTO HOMERIC LAUGHTER. SO ENDED OUR VISIT TO SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH.

AT THIS POINT, HOWEVER, THERE TOOK PLACE, I AM TOLD, AN EXTREMELY ENIGMATIC INCIDENT, AND, I MUST OWN, IT WAS CHIEFLY ON ACCOUNT OF IT THAT I HAVE DESCRIBED THIS EXPEDITION SO MINUTELY.

I AM TOLD THAT WHEN ALL FLOCKED OUT, LIZA, SUPPORTED BY MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, WAS JOSTLED AGAINST NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH IN THE CRUSH IN THE DOORWAY. I MUST MENTION THAT SINCE THAT SUNDAY MORNING WHEN SHE FAINTED THEY HAD NOT APPROACHED EACH OTHER, NOR EXCHANGED A WORD, THOUGH THEY HAD MET MORE THAN ONCE. I SAW THEM BROUGHT TOGETHER IN THE DOORWAY. I FANCIED THEY BOTH STOOD STILL FOR AN INSTANT, AND LOOKED, AS IT WERE, STRANGELY AT ONE ANOTHER, BUT I MAY NOT HAVE SEEN RIGHTLY IN THE CROWD. IT IS ASSERTED, ON THE CONTRARY, AND QUITE SERIOUSLY, THAT LIZA, GLANCING AT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, QUICKLY RAISED HER HAND TO THE LEVEL OF HIS FACE, AND WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE STRUCK HIM IF HE HAD NOT DRAWN BACK IN TIME. PERHAPS SHE WAS DISPLEASED WITH THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE, OR THE WAY HE SMILED, PARTICULARLY JUST AFTER SUCH AN EPISODE WITH MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH. I MUST ADMIT I SAW NOTHING MYSELF, BUT ALL THE OTHERS DECLARED THEY HAD, THOUGH THEY CERTAINLY COULD NOT ALL HAVE SEEN IT IN SUCH A CRUSH, THOUGH PERHAPS SOME MAY HAVE. BUT I DID NOT BELIEVE IT AT THE TIME. I REMEMBER, HOWEVER, THAT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS RATHER PALE ALL THE WAY HOME.

III

ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME, AND CERTAINLY ON THE SAME DAY, THE INTERVIEW AT LAST TOOK PLACE BETWEEN STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH AND VARVARA PETROVNA. SHE HAD LONG HAD THIS MEETING IN HER MIND, AND HAD SENT WORD ABOUT IT TO HER FORMER FRIEND, BUT FOR SOME REASON SHE HAD KEPT PUTTING IT OFF TILL THEN. IT TOOK PLACE AT SKVORESHNIKI; VARVARA PETROVNA ARRIVED AT HER COUNTRY HOUSE ALL IN A BUSTLE; IT HAD BEEN DEFINITELY DECIDED THE EVENING BEFORE THAT THE F√™TE WAS TO TAKE PLACE AT THE MARSHAL‚ÄÔS, BUT VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS RAPID BRAIN AT ONCE GRASPED THAT NO ONE COULD PREVENT HER FROM AFTERWARDS GIVING HER OWN SPECIAL ENTERTAINMENT AT SKVORESHNIKI, AND AGAIN ASSEMBLING THE WHOLE TOWN. THEN EVERY ONE COULD SEE FOR THEMSELVES WHOSE HOUSE WAS BEST, AND IN WHICH MORE TASTE WAS DISPLAYED IN RECEIVING GUESTS AND GIVING A BALL. ALTOGETHER SHE WAS HARDLY TO BE RECOGNISED. SHE SEEMED COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED, AND INSTEAD OF THE UNAPPROACHABLE ‚ÄÚNOBLE LADY‚ÄÙ (STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS EXPRESSION) SEEMED CHANGED INTO THE MOST COMMONPLACE, WHIMSICAL SOCIETY WOMAN. BUT PERHAPS THIS MAY ONLY HAVE BEEN ON THE SURFACE.

WHEN SHE REACHED THE EMPTY HOUSE SHE HAD GONE THROUGH ALL THE ROOMS, ACCOMPANIED BY HER FAITHFUL OLD BUTLER, ALEXEY YEGORYTCH, AND BY FOMUSHKA, A MAN WHO HAD SEEN MUCH OF LIFE AND WAS A SPECIALIST IN DECORATION. THEY BEGAN TO CONSULT AND DELIBERATE: WHAT FURNITURE WAS TO BE BROUGHT FROM THE TOWN HOUSE, WHAT THINGS, WHAT PICTURES, WHERE THEY WERE TO BE PUT, HOW THE CONSERVATORIES AND FLOWERS COULD BE PUT TO THE BEST USE, WHERE TO PUT NEW CURTAINS, WHERE TO HAVE THE REFRESHMENT ROOMS, WHETHER ONE OR TWO, AND SO ON AND SO ON. AND, BEHOLD, IN THE MIDST OF THIS EXCITING BUSTLE SHE SUDDENLY TOOK IT INTO HER HEAD TO SEND FOR STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.

THE LATTER HAD LONG BEFORE RECEIVED NOTICE OF THIS INTERVIEW AND WAS PREPARED FOR IT, AND HE HAD EVERY DAY BEEN EXPECTING JUST SUCH A SUDDEN SUMMONS. AS HE GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE HE CROSSED HIMSELF: HIS FATE WAS BEING DECIDED. HE FOUND HIS FRIEND IN THE BIG DRAWING-ROOM ON THE LITTLE SOFA IN THE RECESS, BEFORE A LITTLE MARBLE TABLE WITH A PENCIL AND PAPER IN HER HANDS. FOMUSHKA, WITH A YARD MEASURE, WAS MEASURING THE HEIGHT OF THE GALLERIES AND THE WINDOWS, WHILE VARVARA PETROVNA HERSELF WAS WRITING DOWN THE NUMBERS AND MAKING NOTES ON THE MARGIN. SHE NODDED IN STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS DIRECTION WITHOUT BREAKING OFF FROM WHAT SHE WAS DOING, AND WHEN THE LATTER MUTTERED SOME SORT OF GREETING, SHE HURRIEDLY GAVE HIM HER HAND, AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT HIM MOTIONED HIM TO A SEAT BESIDE HER.

‚ÄÚI SAT WAITING FOR FIVE MINUTES, ‚ÄÒMASTERING MY HEART,‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ HE TOLD ME AFTERWARDS. ‚ÄÚI SAW BEFORE ME NOT THE WOMAN WHOM I HAD KNOWN FOR TWENTY YEARS. AN ABSOLUTE CONVICTION THAT ALL WAS OVER GAVE ME A STRENGTH WHICH ASTOUNDED EVEN HER. I SWEAR THAT SHE WAS SURPRISED AT MY STOICISM IN THAT LAST HOUR.‚ÄÙ

VARVARA PETROVNA SUDDENLY PUT DOWN HER PENCIL ON THE TABLE AND TURNED QUICKLY TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.

‚ÄÚSTEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, WE HAVE TO TALK OF BUSINESS. I‚ÄÔM SURE YOU HAVE PREPARED ALL YOUR FERVENT WORDS AND VARIOUS PHRASES, BUT WE‚ÄÔD BETTER GO STRAIGHT TO THE POINT, HADN‚ÄÔT WE?‚ÄÙ

SHE HAD BEEN IN TOO GREAT A HURRY TO SHOW THE TONE SHE MEANT TO TAKE. AND WHAT MIGHT NOT COME NEXT?

‚ÄÚWAIT, BE QUIET; LET ME SPEAK. AFTERWARDS YOU SHALL, THOUGH REALLY I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT YOU CAN ANSWER ME,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID IN A RAPID PATTER. ‚ÄÚTHE TWELVE HUNDRED ROUBLES OF YOUR PENSION I CONSIDER A SACRED OBLIGATION TO PAY YOU AS LONG AS YOU LIVE. THOUGH WHY A SACRED OBLIGATION, SIMPLY A CONTRACT; THAT WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL MORE REAL, WOULDN‚ÄÔT IT? IF YOU LIKE, WE‚ÄÔLL WRITE IT OUT. SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN CASE OF MY DEATH. BUT YOU ARE RECEIVING FROM ME AT PRESENT LODGING, SERVANTS, AND YOUR MAINTENANCE IN ADDITION. RECKONING THAT IN MONEY IT WOULD AMOUNT TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED ROUBLES, WOULDN‚ÄÔT IT? I WILL ADD ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED ROUBLES, MAKING THREE THOUSAND ROUBLES IN ALL. WILL THAT BE ENOUGH A YEAR FOR YOU? I THINK THAT‚ÄÔS NOT TOO LITTLE? IN ANY EXTREME EMERGENCY I WOULD ADD SOMETHING MORE. AND SO, TAKE YOUR MONEY, SEND ME BACK MY SERVANTS, AND LIVE BY YOURSELF WHERE YOU LIKE IN PETERSBURG, IN MOSCOW, ABROAD, OR HERE, ONLY NOT WITH ME. DO YOU HEAR?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚONLY LATELY THOSE LIPS DICTATED TO ME AS IMPERATIVELY AND AS SUDDENLY VERY DIFFERENT DEMANDS,‚ÄÙ SAID STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SLOWLY AND WITH SORROWFUL DISTINCTNESS. ‚ÄÚI SUBMITTED ‚Ä¶ AND DANCED THE COSSACK DANCE TO PLEASE YOU. OUI, LA COMPARAISON PEUT √™TRE PERMISE. C‚ÄÔ√©TAIT COMME UN PETIT COSAQUE DU DON QUI SAUTAIT SUR SA PROPRE TOMBE. NOW ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSTOP, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, YOU ARE HORRIBLY LONG-WINDED. YOU DIDN‚ÄÔT DANCE, BUT CAME TO SEE ME IN A NEW TIE, NEW LINEN, GLOVES, SCENTED AND POMATUMED. I ASSURE YOU THAT YOU WERE VERY ANXIOUS TO GET MARRIED YOURSELF; IT WAS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE, AND I ASSURE YOU A MOST UNSEEMLY EXPRESSION IT WAS. IF I DID NOT MENTION IT TO YOU AT THE TIME, IT WAS SIMPLY OUT OF DELICACY. BUT YOU WISHED IT, YOU WANTED TO BE MARRIED, IN SPITE OF THE ABOMINABLE THINGS YOU WROTE ABOUT ME AND YOUR BETROTHED. NOW IT‚ÄÔS VERY DIFFERENT. AND WHAT HAS THE COSAQUE DU DON TO DO WITH IT, AND WHAT TOMB DO YOU MEAN? I DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND THE COMPARISON. ON THE CONTRARY, YOU HAVE ONLY TO LIVE. LIVE AS LONG AS YOU CAN. I SHALL BE DELIGHTED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIN AN ALMSHOUSE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIN AN ALMSHOUSE? PEOPLE DON‚ÄÔT GO INTO ALMSHOUSES WITH THREE THOUSAND ROUBLES A YEAR. AH, I REMEMBER,‚ÄÙ SHE LAUGHED. ‚ÄÚPYOTR STEPANOVITCH DID JOKE ABOUT AN ALMSHOUSE ONCE. BAH, THERE CERTAINLY IS A SPECIAL ALMSHOUSE, WHICH IS WORTH CONSIDERING. IT‚ÄÔS FOR PERSONS WHO ARE HIGHLY RESPECTABLE; THERE ARE COLONELS THERE, AND THERE‚ÄÔS POSITIVELY ONE GENERAL WHO WANTS TO GET INTO IT. IF YOU WENT INTO IT WITH ALL YOUR MONEY, YOU WOULD FIND PEACE, COMFORT, SERVANTS TO WAIT ON YOU. THERE YOU COULD OCCUPY YOURSELF WITH STUDY, AND COULD ALWAYS MAKE UP A PARTY FOR CARDS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPASSONS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPASSONS?‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA WINCED. ‚ÄÚBUT, IF SO, THAT‚ÄÔS ALL. YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN INFORMED THAT WE SHALL LIVE HENCEFORWARD ENTIRELY APART.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND THAT‚ÄÔS ALL?‚ÄÙ HE SAID. ‚ÄÚALL THAT‚ÄÔS LEFT OF TWENTY YEARS? OUR LAST FAREWELL?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE AWFULLY FOND OF THESE EXCLAMATIONS, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. IT‚ÄÔS NOT AT ALL THE FASHION. NOWADAYS PEOPLE TALK ROUGHLY BUT SIMPLY. YOU KEEP HARPING ON OUR TWENTY YEARS! TWENTY YEARS OF MUTUAL VANITY, AND NOTHING MORE. EVERY LETTER YOU‚ÄÔVE WRITTEN ME WAS WRITTEN NOT FOR ME BUT FOR POSTERITY. YOU‚ÄÔRE A STYLIST, AND NOT A FRIEND, AND FRIENDSHIP IS ONLY A SPLENDID WORD. IN REALITY‚ÄÎA MUTUAL EXCHANGE OF SLOPPINESS.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGOOD HEAVENS! HOW MANY SAYINGS NOT YOUR OWN! LESSONS LEARNED BY HEART! THEY‚ÄÔVE ALREADY PUT THEIR UNIFORM ON YOU TOO. YOU, TOO, ARE REJOICING; YOU, TOO, ARE BASKING IN THE SUNSHINE. CH√®RE, CH√®RE, FOR WHAT A MESS OF POTTAGE YOU HAVE SOLD THEM YOUR FREEDOM!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM NOT A PARROT, TO REPEAT OTHER PEOPLE‚ÄÔS PHRASES!‚ÄÙ CRIED VARVARA PETROVNA, BOILING OVER. ‚ÄÚYOU MAY BE SURE I HAVE STORED UP MANY SAYINGS OF MY OWN. WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING FOR ME ALL THESE TWENTY YEARS? YOU REFUSED ME EVEN THE BOOKS I ORDERED FOR YOU, THOUGH, EXCEPT FOR THE BINDER, THEY WOULD HAVE REMAINED UNCUT. WHAT DID YOU GIVE ME TO READ WHEN I ASKED YOU DURING THOSE FIRST YEARS TO BE MY GUIDE? ALWAYS KAPFIG, AND NOTHING BUT KAPFIG. YOU WERE JEALOUS OF MY CULTURE EVEN, AND TOOK MEASURES. AND ALL THE WHILE EVERY ONE‚ÄÔS LAUGHING AT YOU. I MUST CONFESS I ALWAYS CONSIDERED YOU ONLY AS A CRITIC. YOU ARE A LITERARY CRITIC AND NOTHING MORE. WHEN ON THE WAY TO PETERSBURG I TOLD YOU THAT I MEANT TO FOUND A JOURNAL AND TO DEVOTE MY WHOLE LIFE TO IT, YOU LOOKED AT ME IRONICALLY AT ONCE, AND SUDDENLY BECAME HORRIBLY SUPERCILIOUS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT WAS NOT THAT, NOT THAT.‚Ä¶ WE WERE AFRAID THEN OF PERSECUTION.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT WAS JUST THAT. AND YOU COULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE BEEN AFRAID OF PERSECUTION IN PETERSBURG AT THAT TIME. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT IN FEBRUARY, TOO, WHEN THE NEWS OF THE EMANCIPATION CAME, YOU RAN TO ME IN A PANIC, AND DEMANDED THAT I SHOULD AT ONCE GIVE YOU A WRITTEN STATEMENT THAT THE PROPOSED MAGAZINE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU; THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAD BEEN COMING TO SEE ME AND NOT YOU; THAT YOU WERE ONLY A TUTOR WHO LIVED IN THE HOUSE, ONLY BECAUSE HE HAD NOT YET RECEIVED HIS SALARY. ISN‚ÄÔT THAT SO? DO REMEMBER THAT? YOU HAVE DISTINGUISHED YOURSELF ALL YOUR LIFE, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT WAS ONLY A MOMENT OF WEAKNESS, A MOMENT WHEN WE WERE ALONE,‚ÄÙ HE EXCLAIMED MOURNFULLY. ‚ÄÚBUT IS IT POSSIBLE, IS IT POSSIBLE, TO BREAK OFF EVERYTHING FOR THE SAKE OF SUCH PETTY IMPRESSIONS? CAN IT BE THAT NOTHING MORE HAS BEEN LEFT BETWEEN US AFTER THOSE LONG YEARS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE HORRIBLY CALCULATING; YOU KEEP TRYING TO LEAVE ME IN YOUR DEBT. WHEN YOU CAME BACK FROM ABROAD YOU LOOKED DOWN UPON ME AND WOULDN‚ÄÔT LET ME UTTER A WORD, BUT WHEN I CAME BACK MYSELF AND TALKED TO YOU AFTERWARDS OF MY IMPRESSIONS OF THE MADONNA, YOU WOULDN‚ÄÔT HEAR ME, YOU BEGAN SMILING CONDESCENDINGLY INTO YOUR CRAVAT, AS THOUGH I WERE INCAPABLE OF THE SAME FEELINGS AS YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT WAS NOT SO. IT WAS PROBABLY NOT SO. J‚ÄÔAI OUBLI√©!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO; IT WAS SO,‚ÄÙ SHE ANSWERED, ‚ÄÚAND, WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, YOU‚ÄÔVE NOTHING TO PRIDE YOURSELF ON. THAT‚ÄÔS ALL NONSENSE, AND ONE OF YOUR FANCIES. NOW, THERE‚ÄÔS NO ONE, ABSOLUTELY NO ONE, IN ECSTASIES OVER THE MADONNA; NO ONE WASTES TIME OVER IT EXCEPT OLD MEN WHO ARE HOPELESSLY OUT OF DATE. THAT‚ÄÔS ESTABLISHED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚESTABLISHED, IS IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS OF NO USE WHATEVER. THIS JUG‚ÄÔS OF USE BECAUSE ONE CAN POUR WATER INTO IT. THIS PENCIL‚ÄÔS OF USE BECAUSE YOU CAN WRITE ANYTHING WITH IT. BUT THAT WOMAN‚ÄÔS FACE IS INFERIOR TO ANY FACE IN NATURE. TRY DRAWING AN APPLE, AND PUT A REAL APPLE BESIDE IT. WHICH WOULD YOU TAKE? YOU WOULDN‚ÄÔT MAKE A MISTAKE, I‚ÄÔM SURE. THIS IS WHAT ALL OUR THEORIES AMOUNT TO, NOW THAT THE FIRST LIGHT OF FREE INVESTIGATION HAS DAWNED UPON THEM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚINDEED, INDEED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU LAUGH IRONICALLY. AND WHAT USED YOU TO SAY TO ME ABOUT CHARITY? YET THE ENJOYMENT DERIVED FROM CHARITY IS A HAUGHTY AND IMMORAL ENJOYMENT. THE RICH MAN‚ÄÔS ENJOYMENT IN HIS WEALTH, HIS POWER, AND IN THE COMPARISON OF HIS IMPORTANCE WITH THE POOR. CHARITY CORRUPTS GIVER AND TAKER ALIKE; AND, WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, DOES NOT ATTAIN ITS OBJECT, AS IT ONLY INCREASES POVERTY. FATHERS WHO DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO WORK CROWD ROUND THE CHARITABLE LIKE GAMBLERS ROUND THE GAMBLING-TABLE, HOPING FOR GAIN, WHILE THE PITIFUL FARTHINGS THAT ARE FLUNG THEM ARE A HUNDRED TIMES TOO LITTLE. HAVE YOU GIVEN AWAY MUCH IN YOUR LIFE? LESS THAN A ROUBLE, IF YOU TRY AND THINK. TRY TO REMEMBER WHEN LAST YOU GAVE AWAY ANYTHING; IT‚ÄÔLL BE TWO YEARS AGO, MAYBE FOUR. YOU MAKE AN OUTCRY AND ONLY HINDER THINGS. CHARITY OUGHT TO BE FORBIDDEN BY LAW, EVEN IN THE PRESENT STATE OF SOCIETY. IN THE NEW REGIME THERE WILL BE NO POOR AT ALL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, WHAT AN ERUPTION OF BORROWED PHRASES! SO IT‚ÄÔS COME TO THE NEW REGIME ALREADY? UNHAPPY WOMAN, GOD HELP YOU!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES; IT HAS, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. YOU CAREFULLY CONCEALED ALL THESE NEW IDEAS FROM ME, THOUGH EVERY ONE‚ÄÔS FAMILIAR WITH THEM NOWADAYS. AND YOU DID IT SIMPLY OUT OF JEALOUSY, SO AS TO HAVE POWER OVER ME. SO THAT NOW EVEN THAT YULIA IS A HUNDRED MILES AHEAD OF ME. BUT NOW MY EYES HAVE BEEN OPENED. I HAVE DEFENDED YOU, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, ALL I COULD, BUT THERE IS NO ONE WHO DOES NOT BLAME YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚENOUGH!‚ÄÙ SAID HE, GETTING UP FROM HIS SEAT. ‚ÄÚENOUGH! AND WHAT CAN I WISH YOU NOW, UNLESS IT‚ÄÔS REPENTANCE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSIT STILL A MINUTE, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION TO ASK YOU. YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN TOLD OF THE INVITATION TO READ AT THE LITERARY MATIN√©E. IT WAS ARRANGED THROUGH ME. TELL ME WHAT YOU‚ÄÔRE GOING TO READ?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, ABOUT THAT VERY QUEEN OF QUEENS, THAT IDEAL OF HUMANITY, THE SISTINE MADONNA, WHO TO YOUR THINKING IS INFERIOR TO A GLASS OR A PENCIL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSO YOU‚ÄÔRE NOT TAKING SOMETHING HISTORICAL?‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ SAID VARVARA PETROVNA IN MOURNFUL SURPRISE. ‚ÄÚBUT THEY WON‚ÄÔT LISTEN TO YOU. YOU‚ÄÔVE GOT THAT MADONNA ON YOUR BRAIN. YOU SEEM BENT ON PUTTING EVERY ONE TO SLEEP! LET ME ASSURE YOU, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, I AM SPEAKING ENTIRELY IN YOUR OWN INTEREST. IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT MATTER IF YOU WOULD TAKE SOME SHORT BUT INTERESTING STORY OF MEDI√¶VAL COURT LIFE FROM SPANISH HISTORY, OR, BETTER STILL, SOME ANECDOTE, AND PAD IT OUT WITH OTHER ANECDOTES AND WITTY PHRASES OF YOUR OWN. THERE WERE MAGNIFICENT COURTS THEN; LADIES, YOU KNOW, POISONINGS. KARMAZINOV SAYS IT WOULD BE STRANGE IF YOU COULDN‚ÄÔT READ SOMETHING INTERESTING FROM SPANISH HISTORY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚKARMAZINOV‚ÄÎTHAT FOOL WHO HAS WRITTEN HIMSELF OUT‚ÄÎLOOKING FOR A SUBJECT FOR ME!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚKARMAZINOV, THAT ALMOST IMPERIAL INTELLECT. YOU ARE TOO FREE IN YOUR LANGUAGE, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOUR KARMAZINOV IS A SPITEFUL OLD WOMAN WHOSE DAY IS OVER. CH√®RE, CH√®RE, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SO ENSLAVED BY THEM? OH GOD!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI CAN‚ÄÔT ENDURE HIM EVEN NOW FOR THE AIRS HE GIVES HIMSELF. BUT I DO JUSTICE TO HIS INTELLECT. I REPEAT, I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO DEFEND YOU AS FAR AS I COULD. AND WHY DO YOU INSIST ON BEING ABSURD AND TEDIOUS? ON THE CONTRARY, COME ON TO THE PLATFORM WITH A DIGNIFIED SMILE AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LAST GENERATION, AND TELL THEM TWO OR THREE ANECDOTES IN YOUR WITTY WAY, AS ONLY YOU CAN TELL THINGS SOMETIMES. THOUGH YOU MAY BE AN OLD MAN NOW, THOUGH YOU MAY BELONG TO A PAST AGE, THOUGH YOU MAY HAVE DROPPED BEHIND THEM, IN FACT, YET YOU‚ÄÔLL RECOGNISE IT YOURSELF, WITH A SMILE, IN YOUR PREFACE, AND ALL WILL SEE THAT YOU‚ÄÔRE AN AMIABLE, GOOD-NATURED, WITTY RELIC ‚Ä¶ IN BRIEF, A MAN OF THE OLD SAVOUR, AND SO FAR ADVANCED AS TO BE CAPABLE OF APPRECIATING AT THEIR VALUE ALL THE ABSURDITIES OF CERTAIN IDEAS WHICH YOU HAVE HITHERTO FOLLOWED. COME, AS A FAVOUR TO ME, I BEG YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCH√®RE, ENOUGH. DON‚ÄÔT ASK ME. I CAN‚ÄÔT. I SHALL SPEAK OF THE MADONNA, BUT I SHALL RAISE A STORM THAT WILL EITHER CRUSH THEM ALL OR SHATTER ME ALONE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT WILL CERTAINLY BE YOU ALONE, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSUCH IS MY FATE. I WILL SPEAK OF THE CONTEMPTIBLE SLAVE, OF THE STINKING, DEPRAVED FLUNKEY WHO WILL FIRST CLIMB A LADDER WITH SCISSORS IN HIS HANDS, AND SLASH TO PIECES THE DIVINE IMAGE OF THE GREAT IDEAL, IN THE NAME OF EQUALITY, ENVY, AND ‚Ä¶ DIGESTION. LET MY CURSE THUNDER OUT UPON THEM, AND THEN‚ÄÎTHEN ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE MADHOUSE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPERHAPS. BUT IN ANY CASE, WHETHER I SHALL BE LEFT VANQUISHED OR VICTORIOUS, THAT VERY EVENING I SHALL TAKE MY BAG, MY BEGGAR‚ÄÔS BAG. I SHALL LEAVE ALL MY GOODS AND CHATTELS, ALL YOUR PRESENTS, ALL YOUR PENSIONS AND PROMISES OF FUTURE BENEFITS, AND GO FORTH ON FOOT TO END MY LIFE A TUTOR IN A MERCHANT‚ÄÔS FAMILY OR TO DIE SOMEWHERE OF HUNGER IN A DITCH. I HAVE SAID IT. ALEA JACTA EST.‚ÄÙ HE GOT UP AGAIN.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE BEEN CONVINCED FOR YEARS,‚ÄÙ SAID VARVARA PETROVNA, GETTING UP WITH FLASHING EYES, ‚ÄÚTHAT YOUR ONLY OBJECT IN LIFE IS TO PUT ME AND MY HOUSE TO SHAME BY YOUR CALUMNIES! WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY BEING A TUTOR IN A MERCHANT‚ÄÔS FAMILY OR DYING IN A DITCH? IT‚ÄÔS SPITE, CALUMNY, AND NOTHING MORE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU HAVE ALWAYS DESPISED ME. BUT I WILL END LIKE A KNIGHT, FAITHFUL TO MY LADY. YOUR GOOD OPINION HAS ALWAYS BEEN DEARER TO ME THAN ANYTHING. FROM THIS MOMENT I WILL TAKE NOTHING, BUT WILL WORSHIP YOU DISINTERESTEDLY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW STUPID THAT IS!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU HAVE NEVER RESPECTED ME. I MAY HAVE HAD A MASS OF WEAKNESSES. YES, I HAVE SPONGED ON YOU. I SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF NIHILISM, BUT SPONGING HAS NEVER BEEN THE GUIDING MOTIVE OF MY ACTION. IT HAS HAPPENED SO OF ITSELF. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HOW.‚Ä¶ I ALWAYS IMAGINED THERE WAS SOMETHING HIGHER THAN MEAT AND DRINK BETWEEN US, AND‚ÄÎI‚ÄÔVE NEVER, NEVER BEEN A SCOUNDREL! AND SO, TO TAKE THE OPEN ROAD, TO SET THINGS RIGHT. I SET OFF LATE, LATE AUTUMN OUT OF DOORS, THE MIST LIES OVER THE FIELDS, THE HOARFROST OF OLD AGE COVERS THE ROAD BEFORE ME, AND THE WIND HOWLS ABOUT THE APPROACHING GRAVE.‚Ä¶ BUT SO FORWARD, FORWARD, ON MY NEW WAY

     ‚ÄÒFILLED WITH PUREST LOVE AND FERVOUR,
     FAITH WHICH MY SWEET DREAM DID YIELD.‚ÄÔ
OH, MY DREAMS. FAREWELL. TWENTY YEARS. ALEA JACTA EST!‚ÄÙ

HIS FACE WAS WET WITH A SUDDEN GUSH OF TEARS. HE TOOK HIS HAT.

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND LATIN,‚ÄÙ SAID VARVARA PETROVNA, DOING HER BEST TO CONTROL HERSELF.

WHO KNOWS, PERHAPS, SHE TOO FELT LIKE CRYING. BUT CAPRICE AND INDIGNATION ONCE MORE GOT THE UPPER HAND.

‚ÄÚI KNOW ONLY ONE THING, THAT ALL THIS IS CHILDISH NONSENSE. YOU WILL NEVER BE CAPABLE OF CARRYING OUT YOUR THREATS, WHICH ARE A MASS OF EGOISM. YOU WILL SET OFF NOWHERE, TO NO MERCHANT; YOU‚ÄÔLL END VERY PEACEABLY ON MY HANDS, TAKING YOUR PENSION, AND RECEIVING YOUR UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE FRIENDS ON TUESDAYS. GOOD-BYE, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚALEA JACTA EST!‚ÄÙ HE MADE HER A DEEP BOW, AND RETURNED HOME, ALMOST DEAD WITH EMOTION.





CHAPTER VI. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH IS BUSY

I

THE DATE OF THE F√™TE WAS DEFINITELY FIXED, AND VON LEMBKE BECAME MORE AND MORE DEPRESSED. HE WAS FULL OF STRANGE AND SINISTER FOREBODINGS, AND THIS MADE YULIA MIHAILOVNA SERIOUSLY UNEASY. INDEED, THINGS WERE NOT ALTOGETHER SATISFACTORY. OUR MILD GOVERNOR HAD LEFT THE AFFAIRS OF THE PROVINCE A LITTLE OUT OF GEAR; AT THE MOMENT WE WERE THREATENED WITH CHOLERA; SERIOUS OUTBREAKS OF CATTLE PLAGUE HAD APPEARED IN SEVERAL PLACES; FIRES WERE PREVALENT THAT SUMMER IN TOWNS AND VILLAGES; WHILST AMONG THE PEASANTRY FOOLISH RUMOURS OF INCENDIARISM GREW STRONGER AND STRONGER. CASES OF ROBBERY WERE TWICE AS NUMEROUS AS USUAL. BUT ALL THIS, OF COURSE, WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY ORDINARY HAD THERE BEEN NO OTHER AND MORE WEIGHTY REASONS TO DISTURB THE EQUANIMITY OF ANDREY ANTONOVITCH, WHO HAD TILL THEN BEEN IN GOOD SPIRITS.

WHAT STRUCK YULIA MIHAILOVNA MOST OF ALL WAS THAT HE BECAME MORE SILENT AND, STRANGE TO SAY, MORE SECRETIVE EVERY DAY. YET IT WAS HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT HE HAD TO HIDE. IT IS TRUE THAT HE RARELY OPPOSED HER AND AS A RULE FOLLOWED HER LEAD WITHOUT QUESTION. AT HER INSTIGATION, FOR INSTANCE, TWO OR THREE REGULATIONS OF A RISKY AND HARDLY LEGAL CHARACTER WERE INTRODUCED WITH THE OBJECT OF STRENGTHENING THE AUTHORITY OF THE GOVERNOR. THERE WERE SEVERAL OMINOUS INSTANCES OF TRANSGRESSIONS BEING CONDONED WITH THE SAME END IN VIEW; PERSONS WHO DESERVED TO BE SENT TO PRISON AND SIBERIA WERE, SOLELY BECAUSE SHE INSISTED, RECOMMENDED FOR PROMOTION. CERTAIN COMPLAINTS AND INQUIRIES WERE DELIBERATELY AND SYSTEMATICALLY IGNORED. ALL THIS CAME OUT LATER ON. NOT ONLY DID LEMBKE SIGN EVERYTHING, BUT HE DID NOT EVEN GO INTO THE QUESTION OF THE SHARE TAKEN BY HIS WIFE IN THE EXECUTION OF HIS DUTIES. ON THE OTHER HAND, HE BEGAN AT TIMES TO BE RESTIVE ABOUT ‚ÄÚTHE MOST TRIFLING MATTERS,‚ÄÙ TO THE SURPRISE OF YULIA MIHAILOVNA. NO DOUBT HE FELT THE NEED TO MAKE UP FOR THE DAYS OF SUPPRESSION BY BRIEF MOMENTS OF MUTINY. UNLUCKILY, YULIA MIHAILOVNA WAS UNABLE, FOR ALL HER INSIGHT, TO UNDERSTAND THIS HONOURABLE PUNCTILIOUSNESS IN AN HONOURABLE CHARACTER. ALAS, SHE HAD NO THOUGHT TO SPARE FOR THAT, AND THAT WAS THE SOURCE OF MANY MISUNDERSTANDINGS.

THERE ARE SOME THINGS OF WHICH IT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR ME TO WRITE, AND INDEED I AM NOT IN A POSITION TO DO SO. IT IS NOT MY BUSINESS TO DISCUSS THE BLUNDERS OF ADMINISTRATION EITHER, AND I PREFER TO LEAVE OUT THIS ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECT OF THE SUBJECT ALTOGETHER. IN THE CHRONICLE I HAVE BEGUN I‚ÄÔVE SET BEFORE MYSELF A DIFFERENT TASK. MOREOVER A GREAT DEAL WILL BE BROUGHT TO LIGHT BY THE COMMISSION OF INQUIRY WHICH HAS JUST BEEN APPOINTED FOR OUR PROVINCE; IT‚ÄÔS ONLY A MATTER OF WAITING A LITTLE. CERTAIN EXPLANATIONS, HOWEVER, CANNOT BE OMITTED.

BUT TO RETURN TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA. THE POOR LADY (I FEEL VERY SORRY FOR HER) MIGHT HAVE ATTAINED ALL THAT ATTRACTED AND ALLURED HER (RENOWN AND SO ON) WITHOUT ANY SUCH VIOLENT AND ECCENTRIC ACTIONS AS SHE RESOLVED UPON AT THE VERY FIRST STEP. BUT EITHER FROM AN EXAGGERATED PASSION FOR THE ROMANTIC OR FROM THE FREQUENTLY BLIGHTED HOPES OF HER YOUTH, SHE FELT SUDDENLY, AT THE CHANGE OF HER FORTUNES, THAT SHE HAD BECOME ONE OF THE SPECIALLY ELECT, ALMOST GOD‚ÄÔS ANOINTED, ‚ÄÚOVER WHOM THERE GLEAMED A BURNING TONGUE OF FIRE,‚ÄÙ AND THIS TONGUE OF FLAME WAS THE ROOT OF THE MISCHIEF, FOR, AFTER ALL, IT IS NOT LIKE A CHIGNON, WHICH WILL FIT ANY WOMAN‚ÄÔS HEAD. BUT THERE IS NOTHING OF WHICH IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO CONVINCE A WOMAN THAN OF THIS; ON THE CONTRARY, ANYONE WHO CARES TO ENCOURAGE THE DELUSION IN HER WILL ALWAYS BE SURE TO MEET WITH SUCCESS. AND PEOPLE VIED WITH ONE ANOTHER IN ENCOURAGING THE DELUSION IN YULIA MIHAILOVNA. THE POOR WOMAN BECAME AT ONCE THE SPORT OF CONFLICTING INFLUENCES, WHILE FULLY PERSUADED OF HER OWN ORIGINALITY. MANY CLEVER PEOPLE FEATHERED THEIR NESTS AND TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HER SIMPLICITY DURING THE BRIEF PERIOD OF HER RULE IN THE PROVINCE. AND WHAT A JUMBLE THERE WAS UNDER THIS ASSUMPTION OF INDEPENDENCE! SHE WAS FASCINATED AT THE SAME TIME BY THE ARISTOCRATIC ELEMENT AND THE SYSTEM OF BIG LANDED PROPERTIES AND THE INCREASE OF THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS POWER, AND THE DEMOCRATIC ELEMENT, AND THE NEW REFORMS AND DISCIPLINE, AND FREE-THINKING AND STRAY SOCIALISTIC NOTIONS, AND THE CORRECT TONE OF THE ARISTOCRATIC SALON AND THE FREE-AND-EASY, ALMOST POT-HOUSE, MANNERS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT SURROUNDED HER. SHE DREAMED OF ‚ÄÚGIVING HAPPINESS‚ÄÙ AND RECONCILING THE IRRECONCILABLE, OR, RATHER, OF UNITING ALL AND EVERYTHING IN THE ADORATION OF HER OWN PERSON. SHE HAD FAVOURITES TOO; SHE WAS PARTICULARLY FOND OF PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WHO HAD RECOURSE AT TIMES TO THE GROSSEST FLATTERY IN DEALING WITH HER. BUT SHE WAS ATTRACTED BY HIM FOR ANOTHER REASON, AN AMAZING ONE, AND MOST CHARACTERISTIC OF THE POOR LADY: SHE WAS ALWAYS HOPING THAT HE WOULD REVEAL TO HER A REGULAR CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. DIFFICULT AS IT IS TO IMAGINE SUCH A THING, IT REALLY WAS THE CASE. SHE FANCIED FOR SOME REASON THAT THERE MUST BE A NIHILIST PLOT CONCEALED IN THE PROVINCE. BY HIS SILENCE AT ONE TIME AND HIS HINTS AT ANOTHER PYOTR STEPANOVITCH DID MUCH TO STRENGTHEN THIS STRANGE IDEA IN HER. SHE IMAGINED THAT HE WAS IN COMMUNICATION WITH EVERY REVOLUTIONARY ELEMENT IN RUSSIA BUT AT THE SAME TIME PASSIONATELY DEVOTED TO HER. TO DISCOVER THE PLOT, TO RECEIVE THE GRATITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT, TO ENTER ON A BRILLIANT CAREER, TO INFLUENCE THE YOUNG ‚ÄÚBY KINDNESS,‚ÄÙ AND TO RESTRAIN THEM FROM EXTREMES‚ÄÎALL THESE DREAMS EXISTED SIDE BY SIDE IN HER FANTASTIC BRAIN. SHE HAD SAVED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, SHE HAD CONQUERED HIM (OF THIS SHE WAS FOR SOME REASON FIRMLY CONVINCED); SHE WOULD SAVE OTHERS. NONE, NONE OF THEM SHOULD PERISH, SHE SHOULD SAVE THEM ALL; SHE WOULD PICK THEM OUT; SHE WOULD SEND IN THE RIGHT REPORT OF THEM; SHE WOULD ACT IN THE INTERESTS OF THE LOFTIEST JUSTICE, AND PERHAPS POSTERITY AND RUSSIAN LIBERALISM WOULD BLESS HER NAME; YET THE CONSPIRACY WOULD BE DISCOVERED. EVERY ADVANTAGE AT ONCE.

STILL IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT ANDREY ANTONOVITCH SHOULD BE IN RATHER BETTER SPIRITS BEFORE THE FESTIVAL. HE MUST BE CHEERED UP AND REASSURED. FOR THIS PURPOSE SHE SENT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH TO HIM IN THE HOPE THAT HE WOULD RELIEVE HIS DEPRESSION BY SOME MEANS OF CONSOLATION BEST KNOWN TO HIMSELF, PERHAPS BY GIVING HIM SOME INFORMATION, SO TO SPEAK, FIRST HAND. SHE PUT IMPLICIT FAITH IN HIS DEXTERITY.

IT WAS SOME TIME SINCE PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD BEEN IN MR. VON LEMBKE‚ÄÔS STUDY. HE POPPED IN ON HIM JUST WHEN THE SUFFERER WAS IN A MOST STUBBORN MOOD.

II

A COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES HAD ARISEN WHICH MR. VON LEMBKE WAS QUITE UNABLE TO DEAL WITH. IN THE VERY DISTRICT WHERE PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD BEEN HAVING A FESTIVE TIME A SUB-LIEUTENANT HAD BEEN CALLED UP TO BE CENSURED BY HIS IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR, AND THE REPROOF WAS GIVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF THE WHOLE COMPANY. THE SUB-LIEUTENANT WAS A YOUNG MAN FRESH FROM PETERSBURG, ALWAYS SILENT AND MOROSE, OF DIGNIFIED APPEARANCE THOUGH SMALL, STOUT, AND ROSY-CHEEKED. HE RESENTED THE REPRIMAND AND SUDDENLY, WITH A STARTLING SHRIEK THAT ASTONISHED THE WHOLE COMPANY, HE CHARGED AT HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER WITH HIS HEAD BENT DOWN LIKE A WILD BEAST‚ÄÔS, STRUCK HIM, AND BIT HIM ON THE SHOULDER WITH ALL HIS MIGHT; THEY HAD DIFFICULTY IN GETTING HIM OFF. THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT HE HAD GONE OUT OF HIS MIND; ANYWAY, IT BECAME KNOWN THAT OF LATE HE HAD BEEN OBSERVED PERFORMING INCREDIBLY STRANGE ACTIONS. HE HAD, FOR INSTANCE, FLUNG TWO IKONS BELONGING TO HIS LANDLADY OUT OF HIS LODGINGS AND SMASHED UP ONE OF THEM WITH AN AXE; IN HIS OWN ROOM HE HAD, ON THREE STANDS RESEMBLING LECTERNS, LAID OUT THE WORKS OF VOGT, MOLESCHOTT, AND BUCHNER, AND BEFORE EACH LECTERN HE USED TO BURN A CHURCH WAX-CANDLE. FROM THE NUMBER OF BOOKS FOUND IN HIS ROOMS IT COULD BE GATHERED THAT HE WAS A WELL-READ MAN. IF HE HAD HAD FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS HE WOULD PERHAPS HAVE SAILED TO THE ISLAND OF MARQUISAS LIKE THE ‚ÄÚCADET‚ÄÙ TO WHOM HERZEN ALLUDES WITH SUCH SPRIGHTLY HUMOUR IN ONE OF HIS WRITINGS. WHEN HE WAS SEIZED, WHOLE BUNDLES OF THE MOST DESPERATE MANIFESTOES WERE FOUND IN HIS POCKETS AND HIS LODGINGS.

MANIFESTOES ARE A TRIVIAL MATTER TOO, AND TO MY THINKING NOT WORTH TROUBLING ABOUT. WE HAVE SEEN PLENTY OF THEM. BESIDES, THEY WERE NOT NEW MANIFESTOES; THEY WERE, IT WAS SAID LATER, JUST THE SAME AS HAD BEEN CIRCULATED IN THE X PROVINCE, AND LIPUTIN, WHO HAD TRAVELLED IN THAT DISTRICT AND THE NEIGHBOURING PROVINCE SIX WEEKS PREVIOUSLY, DECLARED THAT HE HAD SEEN EXACTLY THE SAME LEAFLETS THERE THEN. BUT WHAT STRUCK ANDREY ANTONOVITCH MOST WAS THAT THE OVERSEER OF SHPIGULIN‚ÄÔS FACTORY HAD BROUGHT THE POLICE JUST AT THE SAME TIME TWO OR THREE PACKETS OF EXACTLY THE SAME LEAFLETS AS HAD BEEN FOUND ON THE LIEUTENANT. THE BUNDLES, WHICH HAD BEEN DROPPED IN THE FACTORY IN THE NIGHT, HAD NOT BEEN OPENED, AND NONE OF THE FACTORY-HANDS HAD HAD TIME TO READ ONE OF THEM. THE INCIDENT WAS A TRIVIAL ONE, BUT IT SET ANDREY ANTONOVITCH PONDERING DEEPLY. THE POSITION PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM IN AN UNPLEASANTLY COMPLICATED LIGHT.

IN THIS FACTORY THE FAMOUS ‚ÄÚSHPIGULIN SCANDAL‚ÄÙ WAS JUST THEN BREWING, WHICH MADE SO MUCH TALK AMONG US AND GOT INTO THE PETERSBURG AND MOSCOW PAPERS WITH ALL SORTS OF VARIATIONS. THREE WEEKS PREVIOUSLY ONE OF THE HANDS HAD FALLEN ILL AND DIED OF ASIATIC CHOLERA; THEN SEVERAL OTHERS WERE STRICKEN DOWN. THE WHOLE TOWN WAS IN A PANIC, FOR THE CHOLERA WAS COMING NEARER AND NEARER AND HAD REACHED THE NEIGHBOURING PROVINCE. I MAY OBSERVE THAT SATISFACTORY SANITARY MEASURES HAD BEEN, SO FAR AS POSSIBLE, TAKEN TO MEET THE UNEXPECTED GUEST. BUT THE FACTORY BELONGING TO THE SHPIGULINS, WHO WERE MILLIONAIRES AND WELL-CONNECTED PEOPLE, HAD SOMEHOW BEEN OVERLOOKED. AND THERE WAS A SUDDEN OUTCRY FROM EVERY ONE THAT THIS FACTORY WAS THE HOT-BED OF INFECTION, THAT THE FACTORY ITSELF, AND ESPECIALLY THE QUARTERS INHABITED BY THE WORKPEOPLE, WERE SO INVETERATELY FILTHY THAT EVEN IF CHOLERA HAD NOT BEEN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THERE MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN AN OUTBREAK THERE. STEPS WERE IMMEDIATELY TAKEN, OF COURSE, AND ANDREY ANTONOVITCH VIGOROUSLY INSISTED ON THEIR BEING CARRIED OUT WITHOUT DELAY WITHIN THREE WEEKS. THE FACTORY WAS CLEANSED, BUT THE SHPIGULINS, FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON, CLOSED IT. ONE OF THE SHPIGULIN BROTHERS ALWAYS LIVED IN PETERSBURG AND THE OTHER WENT AWAY TO MOSCOW WHEN THE ORDER WAS GIVEN FOR CLEANSING THE FACTORY. THE OVERSEER PROCEEDED TO PAY OFF THE WORKPEOPLE AND, AS IT APPEARED, CHEATED THEM SHAMELESSLY. THE HANDS BEGAN TO COMPLAIN AMONG THEMSELVES, ASKING TO BE PAID FAIRLY, AND FOOLISHLY WENT TO THE POLICE, THOUGH WITHOUT MUCH DISTURBANCE, FOR THEY WERE NOT SO VERY MUCH EXCITED. IT WAS JUST AT THIS MOMENT THAT THE MANIFESTOES WERE BROUGHT TO ANDREY ANTONOVITCH BY THE OVERSEER.

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH POPPED INTO THE STUDY UNANNOUNCED, LIKE AN INTIMATE FRIEND AND ONE OF THE FAMILY; BESIDES, HE HAD A MESSAGE FROM YULIA MIHAILOVNA. SEEING HIM, LEMBKE FROWNED GRIMLY AND STOOD STILL AT THE TABLE WITHOUT WELCOMING HIM. TILL THAT MOMENT HE HAD BEEN PACING UP AND DOWN THE STUDY AND HAD BEEN DISCUSSING SOMETHING T√™TE-√†-T√™TE WITH HIS CLERK BLUM, A VERY CLUMSY AND SURLY GERMAN WHOM HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM FROM PETERSBURG, IN SPITE OF THE VIOLENT OPPOSITION OF YULIA MIHAILOVNA. ON PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS ENTRANCE THE CLERK HAD MOVED TO THE DOOR, BUT HAD NOT GONE OUT. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH EVEN FANCIED THAT HE EXCHANGED SIGNIFICANT GLANCES WITH HIS CHIEF.

‚ÄÚAHA, I‚ÄÔVE CAUGHT YOU AT LAST, YOU SECRETIVE MONARCH OF THE TOWN!‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH CRIED OUT LAUGHING, AND LAID HIS HAND OVER THE MANIFESTO ON THE TABLE. ‚ÄÚTHIS INCREASES YOUR COLLECTION, EH?‚ÄÙ

ANDREY ANTONOVITCH FLUSHED CRIMSON; HIS FACE SEEMED TO TWITCH.

‚ÄÚLEAVE OFF, LEAVE OFF AT ONCE!‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, TREMBLING WITH RAGE. ‚ÄÚAND DON‚ÄÔT YOU DARE ‚Ä¶ SIR ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THE MATTER WITH YOU? YOU SEEM TO BE ANGRY!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚALLOW ME TO INFORM YOU, SIR, THAT I‚ÄÔVE NO INTENTION OF PUTTING UP WITH YOUR SANS FA√ßON HENCEFORWARD, AND I BEG YOU TO REMEMBER ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, DAMN IT ALL, HE IS IN EARNEST!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOLD YOUR TONGUE, HOLD YOUR TONGUE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎVON LEMBKE STAMPED ON THE CARPET‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚAND DON‚ÄÔT DARE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

GOD KNOWS WHAT IT MIGHT HAVE COME TO. ALAS, THERE WAS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE INVOLVED IN THE MATTER OF WHICH NEITHER PYOTR STEPANOVITCH NOR EVEN YULIA MIHAILOVNA HERSELF HAD ANY IDEA. THE LUCKLESS ANDREY ANTONOVITCH HAD BEEN SO GREATLY UPSET DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS THAT HE HAD BEGUN TO BE SECRETLY JEALOUS OF HIS WIFE AND PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. IN SOLITUDE, ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT, HE SPENT SOME VERY DISAGREEABLE MOMENTS.

‚ÄÚWELL, I IMAGINED THAT IF A MAN READS YOU HIS NOVEL TWO DAYS RUNNING TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT AND WANTS TO HEAR YOUR OPINION OF IT, HE HAS OF HIS OWN ACT DISCARDED OFFICIAL RELATIONS, ANYWAY.‚Ä¶ YULIA MIHAILOVNA TREATS ME AS A FRIEND; THERE‚ÄÔS NO MAKING YOU OUT,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH BROUGHT OUT, WITH A CERTAIN DIGNITY INDEED. ‚ÄÚHERE IS YOUR NOVEL, BY THE WAY.‚ÄÙ HE LAID ON THE TABLE A LARGE HEAVY MANUSCRIPT ROLLED UP IN BLUE PAPER.

LEMBKE TURNED RED AND LOOKED EMBARRASSED.

‚ÄÚWHERE DID YOU FIND IT?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED DISCREETLY, WITH A RUSH OF JOY WHICH HE WAS UNABLE TO SUPPRESS, THOUGH HE DID HIS UTMOST TO CONCEAL IT.

‚ÄÚONLY FANCY, DONE UP LIKE THIS, IT ROLLED UNDER THE CHEST OF DRAWERS. I MUST HAVE THROWN IT DOWN CARELESSLY ON THE CHEST WHEN I WENT OUT. IT WAS ONLY FOUND THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY, WHEN THE FLOOR WAS SCRUBBED. YOU DID SET ME A TASK, THOUGH!‚ÄÙ

LEMBKE DROPPED HIS EYES STERNLY.

‚ÄÚI HAVEN‚ÄÔT SLEPT FOR THE LAST TWO NIGHTS, THANKS TO YOU. IT WAS FOUND THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY, BUT I KEPT IT, AND HAVE BEEN READING IT EVER SINCE. I‚ÄÔVE NO TIME IN THE DAY, SO I‚ÄÔVE READ IT AT NIGHT. WELL, I DON‚ÄÔT LIKE IT; IT‚ÄÔS NOT MY WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS. BUT THAT‚ÄÔS NO MATTER; I‚ÄÔVE NEVER SET UP FOR BEING A CRITIC, BUT I COULDN‚ÄÔT TEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM IT, MY DEAR MAN, THOUGH I DIDN‚ÄÔT LIKE IT! THE FOURTH AND FIFTH CHAPTERS ARE ‚Ä¶ THEY REALLY ARE ‚Ä¶ DAMN IT ALL, THEY ARE BEYOND WORDS! AND WHAT A LOT OF HUMOUR YOU‚ÄÔVE PACKED INTO IT; IT MADE ME LAUGH! HOW YOU CAN MAKE FUN OF THINGS SANS QUE CELA PARAISSE! AS FOR THE NINTH AND TENTH CHAPTERS, IT‚ÄÔS ALL ABOUT LOVE; THAT‚ÄÔS NOT MY LINE, BUT IT‚ÄÔS EFFECTIVE THOUGH. I WAS NEARLY BLUBBERING OVER EGRENEV‚ÄÔS LETTER, THOUGH YOU‚ÄÔVE SHOWN HIM UP SO CLEVERLY.‚Ä¶ YOU KNOW, IT‚ÄÔS TOUCHING, THOUGH AT THE SAME TIME YOU WANT TO SHOW THE FALSE SIDE OF HIM, AS IT WERE, DON‚ÄÔT YOU? HAVE I GUESSED RIGHT? BUT I COULD SIMPLY BEAT YOU FOR THE ENDING. FOR WHAT ARE YOU SETTING UP? WHY, THE SAME OLD IDOL OF DOMESTIC HAPPINESS, BEGETTING CHILDREN AND MAKING MONEY; ‚ÄÒTHEY WERE MARRIED AND LIVED HAPPY EVER AFTERWARDS‚ÄÔ‚ÄÎCOME, IT‚ÄÔS TOO MUCH! YOU WILL ENCHANT YOUR READERS, FOR EVEN I COULDN‚ÄÔT PUT THE BOOK DOWN; BUT THAT MAKES IT ALL THE WORSE! THE READING PUBLIC IS AS STUPID AS EVER, BUT IT‚ÄÔS THE DUTY OF SENSIBLE PEOPLE TO WAKE THEM UP, WHILE YOU ‚Ä¶ BUT THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH. GOOD-BYE. DON‚ÄÔT BE CROSS ANOTHER TIME; I CAME IN TO YOU BECAUSE I HAD A COUPLE OF WORDS TO SAY TO YOU, BUT YOU ARE SO UNACCOUNTABLE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

ANDREY ANTONOVITCH MEANTIME TOOK HIS NOVEL AND LOCKED IT UP IN AN OAK BOOKCASE, SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY TO WINK TO BLUM TO DISAPPEAR. THE LATTER WITHDREW WITH A LONG, MOURNFUL FACE.

‚ÄÚI AM NOT UNACCOUNTABLE, I AM SIMPLY ‚Ä¶ NOTHING BUT ANNOYANCES,‚ÄÙ HE MUTTERED, FROWNING BUT WITHOUT ANGER, AND SITTING DOWN TO THE TABLE. ‚ÄÚSIT DOWN AND SAY WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. IT‚ÄÔS A LONG TIME SINCE I‚ÄÔVE SEEN YOU, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, ONLY DON‚ÄÔT BURST UPON ME IN THE FUTURE WITH SUCH MANNERS ‚Ä¶ SOMETIMES, WHEN ONE HAS BUSINESS, IT‚ÄÔS ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMY MANNERS ARE ALWAYS THE SAME.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNOW, AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU MEAN NOTHING BY IT, BUT SOMETIMES ONE IS WORRIED.‚Ä¶ SIT DOWN.‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH IMMEDIATELY LOLLED BACK ON THE SOFA AND DREW HIS LEGS UNDER HIM.

III

‚ÄÚWHAT SORT OF WORRIES? SURELY NOT THESE TRIFLES?‚ÄÙ HE NODDED TOWARDS THE MANIFESTO. ‚ÄÚI CAN BRING YOU AS MANY OF THEM AS YOU LIKE; I MADE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE IN X PROVINCE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU MEAN AT THE TIME YOU WERE STAYING THERE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOF COURSE, IT WAS NOT IN MY ABSENCE. I REMEMBER THERE WAS A HATCHET PRINTED AT THE TOP OF IT. ALLOW ME.‚ÄÙ (HE TOOK UP THE MANIFESTO.) ‚ÄÚYES, THERE‚ÄÔS THE HATCHET HERE TOO; THAT‚ÄÔS IT, THE VERY SAME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, HERE‚ÄÔS A HATCHET. YOU SEE, A HATCHET.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, IS IT THE HATCHET THAT SCARES YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, IT‚ÄÔS NOT ‚Ä¶ AND I AM NOT SCARED; BUT THIS BUSINESS ‚Ä¶ IT IS A BUSINESS; THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT SORT? THAT IT‚ÄÔS COME FROM THE FACTORY? HE HE! BUT DO YOU KNOW, AT THAT FACTORY THE WORKPEOPLE WILL SOON BE WRITING MANIFESTOES FOR THEMSELVES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU MEAN?‚ÄÙ VON LEMBKE STARED AT HIM SEVERELY.

‚ÄÚWHAT I SAY. YOU‚ÄÔVE ONLY TO LOOK AT THEM. YOU ARE TOO SOFT, ANDREY ANTONOVITCH; YOU WRITE NOVELS. BUT THIS HAS TO BE HANDLED IN THE GOOD OLD WAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE GOOD OLD WAY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ADVISING ME? THE FACTORY HAS BEEN CLEANED; I GAVE THE ORDER AND THEY‚ÄÔVE CLEANED IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND THE WORKMEN ARE IN REBELLION. THEY OUGHT TO BE FLOGGED, EVERY ONE OF THEM; THAT WOULD BE THE END OF IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIN REBELLION? THAT‚ÄÔS NONSENSE; I GAVE THE ORDER AND THEY‚ÄÔVE CLEANED IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚECH, YOU ARE SOFT, ANDREY ANTONOVITCH!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIN THE FIRST PLACE, I AM NOT SO SOFT AS YOU THINK, AND IN THE SECOND PLACE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ VON LEMBKE WAS PIQUED AGAIN. HE HAD EXERTED HIMSELF TO KEEP UP THE CONVERSATION WITH THE YOUNG MAN FROM CURIOSITY, WONDERING IF HE WOULD TELL HIM ANYTHING NEW.

‚ÄÚHA HA, AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE AGAIN,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH INTERRUPTED, POUNCING ON ANOTHER DOCUMENT THAT LAY UNDER A PAPER-WEIGHT, SOMETHING LIKE A MANIFESTO, OBVIOUSLY PRINTED ABROAD AND IN VERSE. ‚ÄÚOH, COME, I KNOW THIS ONE BY HEART, ‚ÄÒA NOBLE PERSONALITY.‚ÄÔ LET ME HAVE A LOOK AT IT‚ÄÎYES, ‚ÄÒA NOBLE PERSONALITY‚ÄÔ IT IS. I MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THAT PERSONALITY ABROAD. WHERE DID YOU UNEARTH IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU SAY YOU‚ÄÔVE SEEN IT ABROAD?‚ÄÙ VON LEMBKE SAID EAGERLY.

‚ÄÚI SHOULD THINK SO, FOUR MONTHS AGO, OR MAY BE FIVE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU SEEM TO HAVE SEEN A GREAT DEAL ABROAD.‚ÄÙ VON LEMBKE LOOKED AT HIM SUBTLY.

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, NOT HEEDING HIM, UNFOLDED THE DOCUMENT AND READ THE POEM ALOUD:

‚ÄÚA NOBLE PERSONALITY

     ‚ÄÚHE WAS NOT OF RANK EXALTED,
     HE WAS NOT OF NOBLE BIRTH,
     HE WAS BRED AMONG THE PEOPLE
     IN THE BREAST OF MOTHER EARTH.
     BUT THE MALICE OF THE NOBLES
     AND THE TSAR‚ÄÔS REVENGEFUL WRATH
     DROVE HIM FORTH TO GRIEF AND TORTURE
     ON THE MARTYR‚ÄÔS CHOSEN PATH.
     HE SET OUT TO TEACH THE PEOPLE
     FREEDOM, LOVE, EQUALITY,
     TO EXHORT THEM TO RESISTANCE;
     BUT TO FLEE THE PENALTY
     OF THE PRISON, WHIP AND GALLOWS,
     TO A FOREIGN LAND HE WENT.
     WHILE THE PEOPLE WAITED HOPING
     FROM SMOLENSK TO FAR TASHKENT,
     WAITED EAGER FOR HIS COMING
     TO REBEL AGAINST THEIR FATE,
     TO ARISE AND CRUSH THE TSARDOM
     AND THE NOBLES‚ÄÔ VICIOUS HATE,
     TO SHARE ALL THE WEALTH IN COMMON,
     AND THE ANTIQUATED THRALL
     OF THE CHURCH, THE HOME AND MARRIAGE
     TO ABOLISH ONCE FOR ALL.‚ÄÙ
‚ÄÚYOU GOT IT FROM THAT OFFICER, I SUPPOSE, EH?‚ÄÙ ASKED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH.

‚ÄÚWHY, DO YOU KNOW THAT OFFICER, THEN, TOO?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SHOULD THINK SO. I HAD A GAY TIME WITH HIM THERE FOR TWO DAYS; HE WAS BOUND TO GO OUT OF HIS MIND.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPERHAPS HE DID NOT GO OUT OF HIS MIND.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU THINK HE DIDN‚ÄÔT BECAUSE HE BEGAN TO BITE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT, EXCUSE ME, IF YOU SAW THOSE VERSES ABROAD AND THEN, IT APPEARS, AT THAT OFFICER‚ÄÔS ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT, PUZZLING, IS IT? YOU ARE PUTTING ME THROUGH AN EXAMINATION, ANDREY ANTONOVITCH, I SEE. YOU SEE,‚ÄÙ HE BEGAN SUDDENLY WITH EXTRAORDINARY DIGNITY, ‚ÄÚAS TO WHAT I SAW ABROAD I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN EXPLANATIONS, AND MY EXPLANATIONS WERE FOUND SATISFACTORY, OTHERWISE I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN GRATIFYING THIS TOWN WITH MY PRESENCE. I CONSIDER THAT THE QUESTION AS REGARDS ME HAS BEEN SETTLED, AND I AM NOT OBLIGED TO GIVE ANY FURTHER ACCOUNT OF MYSELF, NOT BECAUSE I AM AN INFORMER, BUT BECAUSE I COULD NOT HELP ACTING AS I DID. THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA ABOUT ME KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT, AND THEY SAID I WAS AN HONEST MAN.‚Ä¶ BUT THAT‚ÄÔS NEITHER HERE NOR THERE; I‚ÄÔVE COME TO SEE YOU ABOUT A SERIOUS MATTER, AND IT‚ÄÔS AS WELL YOU‚ÄÔVE SENT YOUR CHIMNEY-SWEEP AWAY. IT‚ÄÔS A MATTER OF IMPORTANCE TO ME, ANDREY ANTONOVITCH. I SHALL HAVE A VERY GREAT FAVOUR TO ASK OF YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚA FAVOUR? H‚ÄÔM ‚Ä¶ BY ALL MEANS; I AM WAITING AND, I CONFESS, WITH CURIOSITY. AND I MUST ADD, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, THAT YOU SURPRISE ME NOT A LITTLE.‚ÄÙ

VON LEMBKE WAS IN SOME AGITATION. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH CROSSED HIS LEGS.

‚ÄÚIN PETERSBURG,‚ÄÙ HE BEGAN, ‚ÄÚI TALKED FREELY OF MOST THINGS, BUT THERE WERE THINGS‚ÄÎTHIS, FOR INSTANCE‚ÄÙ (HE TAPPED THE ‚ÄÚNOBLE PERSONALITY‚ÄÙ WITH HIS FINGER) ‚ÄÚABOUT WHICH I HELD MY TONGUE‚ÄÎIN THE FIRST PLACE, BECAUSE IT WASN‚ÄÔT WORTH TALKING ABOUT, AND SECONDLY, BECAUSE I ONLY ANSWERED QUESTIONS. I DON‚ÄÔT CARE TO PUT MYSELF FORWARD IN SUCH MATTERS; IN THAT I SEE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A ROGUE AND AN HONEST MAN FORCED BY CIRCUMSTANCES. WELL, IN SHORT, WE‚ÄÔLL DISMISS THAT. BUT NOW ‚Ä¶ NOW THAT THESE FOOLS ‚Ä¶ NOW THAT THIS HAS COME TO THE SURFACE AND IS IN YOUR HANDS, AND I SEE THAT YOU‚ÄÔLL FIND OUT ALL ABOUT IT‚ÄÎFOR YOU ARE A MAN WITH EYES AND ONE CAN‚ÄÔT TELL BEFOREHAND WHAT YOU‚ÄÔLL DO‚ÄÎAND THESE FOOLS ARE STILL GOING ON, I ‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶ WELL, THE FACT IS, I‚ÄÔVE COME TO ASK YOU TO SAVE ONE MAN, A FOOL TOO, MOST LIKELY MAD, FOR THE SAKE OF HIS YOUTH, HIS MISFORTUNES, IN THE NAME OF YOUR HUMANITY.‚Ä¶ YOU CAN‚ÄÔT BE SO HUMANE ONLY IN THE NOVELS YOU MANUFACTURE!‚ÄÙ HE SAID, BREAKING OFF WITH COARSE SARCASM AND IMPATIENCE.

IN FACT, HE WAS SEEN TO BE A STRAIGHTFORWARD MAN, AWKWARD AND IMPOLITIC FROM EXCESS OF HUMANE FEELING AND PERHAPS FROM EXCESSIVE SENSITIVENESS‚ÄÎABOVE ALL, A MAN OF LIMITED INTELLIGENCE, AS VON LEMBKE SAW AT ONCE WITH EXTRAORDINARY SUBTLETY. HE HAD INDEED LONG SUSPECTED IT, ESPECIALLY WHEN DURING THE PREVIOUS WEEK HE HAD, SITTING ALONE IN HIS STUDY AT NIGHT, SECRETLY CURSED HIM WITH ALL HIS HEART FOR THE INEXPLICABLE WAY IN WHICH HE HAD GAINED YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS GOOD GRACES.

‚ÄÚFOR WHOM ARE YOU INTERCEDING, AND WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN?‚ÄÙ HE INQUIRED MAJESTICALLY, TRYING TO CONCEAL HIS CURIOSITY.

‚ÄÚIT ‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS ‚Ä¶ DAMN IT! IT‚ÄÔS NOT MY FAULT THAT I TRUST YOU! IS IT MY FAULT THAT I LOOK UPON YOU AS A MOST HONOURABLE AND, ABOVE ALL, A SENSIBLE MAN ‚Ä¶ CAPABLE, THAT IS, OF UNDERSTANDING ‚Ä¶ DAMN ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

THE POOR FELLOW EVIDENTLY COULD NOT MASTER HIS EMOTION.

‚ÄÚYOU MUST UNDERSTAND AT LAST,‚ÄÙ HE WENT ON, ‚ÄÚYOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT IN PRONOUNCING HIS NAME I AM BETRAYING HIM TO YOU‚ÄÎI AM BETRAYING HIM, AM I NOT? I AM, AM I NOT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT HOW AM I TO GUESS IF YOU DON‚ÄÔT MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO SPEAK OUT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS JUST IT; YOU ALWAYS CUT THE GROUND FROM UNDER ONE‚ÄÔS FEET WITH YOUR LOGIC, DAMN IT.‚Ä¶ WELL, HERE GOES ‚Ä¶ THIS ‚ÄÒNOBLE PERSONALITY,‚ÄÔ THIS ‚ÄÒSTUDENT‚ÄÔ ‚Ä¶ IS SHATOV ‚Ä¶ THAT‚ÄÔS ALL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSHATOV? HOW DO YOU MEAN IT‚ÄÔS SHATOV?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSHATOV IS THE ‚ÄÒSTUDENT‚ÄÔ WHO IS MENTIONED IN THIS. HE LIVES HERE, HE WAS ONCE A SERF, THE MAN WHO GAVE THAT SLAP.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNOW, I KNOW.‚ÄÙ LEMBKE SCREWED UP HIS EYES. ‚ÄÚBUT EXCUSE ME, WHAT IS HE ACCUSED OF? PRECISELY AND, ABOVE ALL, WHAT IS YOUR PETITION?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI BEG YOU TO SAVE HIM, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? I USED TO KNOW HIM EIGHT YEARS AGO, I MIGHT ALMOST SAY I WAS HIS FRIEND,‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, COMPLETELY CARRIED AWAY. ‚ÄÚBUT I AM NOT BOUND TO GIVE YOU AN ACCOUNT OF MY PAST LIFE,‚ÄÙ HE ADDED, WITH A GESTURE OF DISMISSAL. ‚ÄÚALL THIS IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE; IT‚ÄÔS THE CASE OF THREE MEN AND A HALF, AND WITH THOSE THAT ARE ABROAD YOU CAN‚ÄÔT MAKE UP A DOZEN. BUT WHAT I AM BUILDING UPON IS YOUR HUMANITY AND YOUR INTELLIGENCE. YOU WILL UNDERSTAND AND YOU WILL PUT THE MATTER IN ITS TRUE LIGHT, AS THE FOOLISH DREAM OF A MAN DRIVEN CRAZY ‚Ä¶ BY MISFORTUNES, BY CONTINUED MISFORTUNES, AND NOT AS SOME IMPOSSIBLE POLITICAL PLOT OR GOD KNOWS WHAT!‚ÄÙ

HE WAS ALMOST GASPING FOR BREATH.

‚ÄÚH‚ÄÔM. I SEE THAT HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MANIFESTOES WITH THE AXE,‚ÄÙ LEMBKE CONCLUDED ALMOST MAJESTICALLY. ‚ÄÚEXCUSE ME, THOUGH, IF HE WERE THE ONLY PERSON CONCERNED, HOW COULD HE HAVE DISTRIBUTED IT BOTH HERE AND IN OTHER DISTRICTS AND IN THE X PROVINCE ‚Ä¶ AND, ABOVE ALL, WHERE DID HE GET THEM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT I TELL YOU THAT AT THE UTMOST THERE ARE NOT MORE THAN FIVE PEOPLE IN IT‚ÄÎA DOZEN PERHAPS. HOW CAN I TELL?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU DON‚ÄÔT KNOW?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW SHOULD I KNOW?‚ÄÎDAMN IT ALL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, YOU KNEW THAT SHATOV WAS ONE OF THE CONSPIRATORS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚECH!‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAVED HIS HAND AS THOUGH TO KEEP OFF THE OVERWHELMING PENETRATION OF THE INQUIRER. ‚ÄÚWELL, LISTEN. I‚ÄÔLL TELL YOU THE WHOLE TRUTH: OF THE MANIFESTOES I KNOW NOTHING‚ÄÎTHAT IS, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. DAMN IT ALL, DON‚ÄÔT YOU KNOW WHAT NOTHING MEANS?‚Ä¶ THAT SUB-LIEUTENANT, TO BE SURE, AND SOMEBODY ELSE AND SOMEONE ELSE HERE ‚Ä¶ AND SHATOV PERHAPS AND SOMEONE ELSE TOO‚ÄÎWELL, THAT‚ÄÔS THE LOT OF THEM ‚Ä¶ A WRETCHED LOT.‚Ä¶ BUT I‚ÄÔVE COME TO INTERCEDE FOR SHATOV. HE MUST BE SAVED, FOR THIS POEM IS HIS, HIS OWN COMPOSITION, AND IT WAS THROUGH HIM IT WAS PUBLISHED ABROAD; THAT I KNOW FOR A FACT, BUT OF THE MANIFESTOES I REALLY KNOW NOTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF THE POEM IS HIS WORK, NO DOUBT THE MANIFESTOES ARE TOO. BUT WHAT DATA HAVE YOU FOR SUSPECTING MR. SHATOV?‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WITH THE AIR OF A MAN DRIVEN OUT OF ALL PATIENCE, PULLED A POCKET-BOOK OUT OF HIS POCKET AND TOOK A NOTE OUT OF IT.

‚ÄÚHERE ARE THE FACTS,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, FLINGING IT ON THE TABLE.

LEMBKE UNFOLDED IT; IT TURNED OUT TO BE A NOTE WRITTEN SIX MONTHS BEFORE FROM HERE TO SOME ADDRESS ABROAD. IT WAS A BRIEF NOTE, ONLY TWO LINES:

‚ÄÚI CAN‚ÄÔT PRINT ‚ÄÒA NOBLE PERSONALITY‚ÄÔ HERE, AND IN FACT I CAN DO NOTHING; PRINT IT ABROAD.

‚ÄÚIV. SHATOV.‚ÄÙ

LEMBKE LOOKED INTENTLY AT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. VARVARA PETROVNA HAD BEEN RIGHT IN SAYING THAT HE HAD AT TIMES THE EXPRESSION OF A SHEEP.

‚ÄÚYOU SEE, IT‚ÄÔS LIKE THIS,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH BURST OUT. ‚ÄÚHE WROTE THIS POEM HERE SIX MONTHS AGO, BUT HE COULDN‚ÄÔT GET IT PRINTED HERE, IN A SECRET PRINTING PRESS, AND SO HE ASKS TO HAVE IT PRINTED ABROAD.‚Ä¶ THAT SEEMS CLEAR.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, THAT‚ÄÔS CLEAR, BUT TO WHOM DID HE WRITE? THAT‚ÄÔS NOT CLEAR YET,‚ÄÙ LEMBKE OBSERVED WITH THE MOST SUBTLE IRONY.

‚ÄÚWHY, KIRILLOV, OF COURSE; THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN TO KIRILLOV ABROAD.‚Ä¶ SURELY YOU KNEW THAT? WHAT‚ÄÔS SO ANNOYING IS THAT PERHAPS YOU ARE ONLY PUTTING IT ON BEFORE ME, AND MOST LIKELY YOU KNEW ALL ABOUT THIS POEM AND EVERYTHING LONG AGO! HOW DID IT COME TO BE ON YOUR TABLE? IT FOUND ITS WAY THERE SOMEHOW! WHY ARE YOU TORTURING ME, IF SO?‚ÄÙ

HE FEVERISHLY MOPPED HIS FOREHEAD WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF.

‚ÄÚI KNOW SOMETHING, PERHAPS.‚ÄÙ LEMBKE PARRIED DEXTEROUSLY. ‚ÄÚBUT WHO IS THIS KIRILLOV?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAN ENGINEER WHO HAS LATELY COME TO THE TOWN. HE WAS STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS SECOND, A MANIAC, A MADMAN; YOUR SUB-LIEUTENANT MAY REALLY ONLY BE SUFFERING FROM TEMPORARY DELIRIUM, BUT KIRILLOV IS A THOROUGHGOING MADMAN‚ÄÎTHOROUGHGOING, THAT I GUARANTEE. AH, ANDREY ANTONOVITCH, IF THE GOVERNMENT ONLY KNEW WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE THESE CONSPIRATORS ALL ARE, THEY WOULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE THE HEART TO LAY A FINGER ON THEM. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM OUGHT TO BE IN AN ASYLUM; I HAD A GOOD LOOK AT THEM IN SWITZERLAND AND AT THE CONGRESSES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFROM WHICH THEY DIRECT THE MOVEMENT HERE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, WHO DIRECTS IT? THREE MEN AND A HALF. IT MAKES ONE SICK TO THINK OF THEM. AND WHAT SORT OF MOVEMENT IS THERE HERE? MANIFESTOES! AND WHAT RECRUITS HAVE THEY MADE? SUB-LIEUTENANTS IN BRAIN FEVER AND TWO OR THREE STUDENTS! YOU ARE A SENSIBLE MAN: ANSWER THIS QUESTION. WHY DON‚ÄÔT PEOPLE OF CONSEQUENCE JOIN THEIR RANKS? WHY ARE THEY ALL STUDENTS AND HALF-BAKED BOYS OF TWENTY-TWO? AND NOT MANY OF THOSE. I DARE SAY THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF BLOODHOUNDS ON THEIR TRACK, BUT HAVE THEY TRACKED OUT MANY OF THEM? SEVEN! I TELL YOU IT MAKES ONE SICK.‚ÄÙ

LEMBKE LISTENED WITH ATTENTION BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION THAT SEEMED TO SAY, ‚ÄÚYOU DON‚ÄÔT FEED NIGHTINGALES ON FAIRY-TALES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEXCUSE ME, THOUGH. YOU ASSERTED THAT THE LETTER WAS SENT ABROAD, BUT THERE‚ÄÔS NO ADDRESS ON IT; HOW DO YOU COME TO KNOW THAT IT WAS ADDRESSED TO MR. KIRILLOV AND ABROAD TOO AND ‚Ä¶ AND ‚Ä¶ THAT IT REALLY WAS WRITTEN BY MR. SHATOV?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, FETCH SOME SPECIMEN OF SHATOV‚ÄÔS WRITING AND COMPARE IT. YOU MUST HAVE SOME SIGNATURE OF HIS IN YOUR OFFICE. AS FOR ITS BEING ADDRESSED TO KIRILLOV, IT WAS KIRILLOV HIMSELF SHOWED IT ME AT THE TIME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEN YOU WERE YOURSELF ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOF COURSE I WAS, MYSELF. THEY SHOWED ME LOTS OF THINGS OUT THERE. AND AS FOR THIS POEM, THEY SAY IT WAS WRITTEN BY HERZEN TO SHATOV WHEN HE WAS STILL WANDERING ABROAD, IN MEMORY OF THEIR MEETING, SO THEY SAY, BY WAY OF PRAISE AND RECOMMENDATION‚ÄÎDAMN IT ALL ‚Ä¶ AND SHATOV CIRCULATES IT AMONG THE YOUNG PEOPLE AS MUCH AS TO SAY, ‚ÄÒTHIS WAS HERZEN‚ÄÔS OPINION OF ME.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHA HA!‚ÄÙ CRIED LEMBKE, FEELING HE HAD GOT TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AT LAST. ‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS JUST WHAT I WAS WONDERING: ONE CAN UNDERSTAND THE MANIFESTO, BUT WHAT‚ÄÔS THE OBJECT OF THE POEM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOF COURSE YOU‚ÄÔD SEE IT. GOODNESS KNOWS WHY I‚ÄÔVE BEEN BABBLING TO YOU. LISTEN. SPARE SHATOV FOR ME AND THE REST MAY GO TO THE DEVIL‚ÄÎEVEN KIRILLOV, WHO IS IN HIDING NOW, SHUT UP IN FILIPOV‚ÄÔS HOUSE, WHERE SHATOV LODGES TOO. THEY DON‚ÄÔT LIKE ME BECAUSE I‚ÄÔVE TURNED ROUND ‚Ä¶ BUT PROMISE ME SHATOV AND I‚ÄÔLL DISH THEM ALL UP FOR YOU. I SHALL BE OF USE, ANDREY ANTONOVITCH! I RECKON NINE OR TEN MEN MAKE UP THE WHOLE WRETCHED LOT. I AM KEEPING AN EYE ON THEM MYSELF, ON MY OWN ACCOUNT. WE KNOW OF THREE ALREADY: SHATOV, KIRILLOV, AND THAT SUB-LIEUTENANT. THE OTHERS I AM ONLY WATCHING CAREFULLY ‚Ä¶ THOUGH I AM PRETTY SHARP-SIGHTED TOO. IT‚ÄÔS THE SAME OVER AGAIN AS IT WAS IN THE X PROVINCE: TWO STUDENTS, A SCHOOLBOY, TWO NOBLEMEN OF TWENTY, A TEACHER, AND A HALF-PAY MAJOR OF SIXTY, CRAZY WITH DRINK, HAVE BEEN CAUGHT WITH MANIFESTOES; THAT WAS ALL‚ÄÎYOU CAN TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, THAT WAS ALL; IT WAS QUITE A SURPRISE THAT THAT WAS ALL. BUT I MUST HAVE SIX DAYS. I HAVE RECKONED IT OUT‚ÄÎSIX DAYS, NOT LESS. IF YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT ANY RESULT, DON‚ÄÔT DISTURB THEM FOR SIX DAYS AND I CAN KILL ALL THE BIRDS WITH ONE STONE FOR YOU; BUT IF YOU FLUTTER THEM BEFORE, THE BIRDS WILL FLY AWAY. BUT SPARE ME SHATOV. I SPEAK FOR SHATOV.‚Ä¶ THE BEST PLAN WOULD BE TO FETCH HIM HERE SECRETLY, IN A FRIENDLY WAY, TO YOUR STUDY AND QUESTION HIM WITHOUT DISGUISING THE FACTS.‚Ä¶ I HAVE NO DOUBT HE‚ÄÔLL THROW HIMSELF AT YOUR FEET AND BURST INTO TEARS! HE IS A HIGHLY STRUNG AND UNFORTUNATE FELLOW; HIS WIFE IS CARRYING ON WITH STAVROGIN. BE KIND TO HIM AND HE WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING, BUT I MUST HAVE SIX DAYS.‚Ä¶ AND, ABOVE ALL, ABOVE ALL, NOT A WORD TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA. IT‚ÄÔS A SECRET. MAY IT BE A SECRET?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT?‚ÄÙ CRIED LEMBKE, OPENING WIDE HIS EYES. ‚ÄÚDO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU SAID NOTHING OF THIS TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO HER? HEAVEN FORBID! ECH, ANDREY ANTONOVITCH! YOU SEE, I VALUE HER FRIENDSHIP AND I HAVE THE HIGHEST RESPECT FOR HER ‚Ä¶ AND ALL THE REST OF IT ‚Ä¶ BUT I COULDN‚ÄÔT MAKE SUCH A BLUNDER. I DON‚ÄÔT CONTRADICT HER, FOR, AS YOU KNOW YOURSELF, IT‚ÄÔS DANGEROUS TO CONTRADICT HER. I MAY HAVE DROPPED A WORD TO HER, FOR I KNOW SHE LIKES THAT, BUT TO SUPPOSE THAT I MENTIONED NAMES TO HER AS I HAVE TO YOU OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT! MY GOOD SIR! WHY AM I APPEALING TO YOU? BECAUSE YOU ARE A MAN, ANYWAY, A SERIOUS PERSON WITH OLD-FASHIONED FIRMNESS AND EXPERIENCE IN THE SERVICE. YOU‚ÄÔVE SEEN LIFE. YOU MUST KNOW BY HEART EVERY DETAIL OF SUCH AFFAIRS, I EXPECT, FROM WHAT YOU‚ÄÔVE SEEN IN PETERSBURG. BUT IF I WERE TO MENTION THOSE TWO NAMES, FOR INSTANCE, TO HER, SHE‚ÄÔD STIR UP SUCH A HUBBUB.‚Ä¶ YOU KNOW, SHE WOULD LIKE TO ASTONISH PETERSBURG. NO, SHE‚ÄÔS TOO HOT-HEADED, SHE REALLY IS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, SHE HAS SOMETHING OF THAT FOUGUE,‚ÄÙ ANDREY ANTONOVITCH MUTTERED WITH SOME SATISFACTION, THOUGH AT THE SAME TIME HE RESENTED THIS UNMANNERLY FELLOW‚ÄÔS DARING TO EXPRESS HIMSELF RATHER FREELY ABOUT YULIA MIHAILOVNA. BUT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH PROBABLY IMAGINED THAT HE HAD NOT GONE FAR ENOUGH AND THAT HE MUST EXERT HIMSELF FURTHER TO FLATTER LEMBKE AND MAKE A COMPLETE CONQUEST OF HIM.

‚ÄÚFOUGUE IS JUST IT,‚ÄÙ HE ASSENTED. ‚ÄÚSHE MAY BE A WOMAN OF GENIUS, A LITERARY WOMAN, BUT SHE WOULD SCARE OUR SPARROWS. SHE WOULDN‚ÄÔT BE ABLE TO KEEP QUIET FOR SIX HOURS, LET ALONE SIX DAYS. ECH, ANDREY ANTONOVITCH, DON‚ÄÔT ATTEMPT TO TIE A WOMAN DOWN FOR SIX DAYS! YOU DO ADMIT THAT I HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE‚ÄÎIN THIS SORT OF THING, I MEAN; I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT, AND YOU KNOW THAT I MAY VERY WELL KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I AM NOT ASKING FOR SIX DAYS FOR FUN BUT WITH AN OBJECT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI HAVE HEARD ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ (LEMBKE HESITATED TO UTTER HIS THOUGHT) ‚ÄÚI HAVE HEARD THAT ON YOUR RETURN FROM ABROAD YOU MADE SOME EXPRESSION ‚Ä¶ AS IT WERE OF REPENTANCE, IN THE PROPER QUARTER?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, THAT‚ÄÔS AS IT MAY BE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND, OF COURSE, I DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO GO INTO IT.‚Ä¶ BUT IT HAS SEEMED TO ME ALL ALONG THAT YOU‚ÄÔVE TALKED IN QUITE A DIFFERENT STYLE‚ÄÎABOUT THE CHRISTIAN FAITH, FOR INSTANCE, ABOUT SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT EVEN.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE SAID LOTS OF THINGS, NO DOUBT, I AM SAYING THEM STILL; BUT SUCH IDEAS MUSTN‚ÄÔT BE APPLIED AS THOSE FOOLS DO IT, THAT‚ÄÔS THE POINT. WHAT‚ÄÔS THE GOOD OF BITING HIS SUPERIOR‚ÄÔS SHOULDER! YOU AGREED WITH ME YOURSELF, ONLY YOU SAID IT WAS PREMATURE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DIDN‚ÄÔT MEAN THAT WHEN I AGREED AND SAID IT WAS PREMATURE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU WEIGH EVERY WORD YOU UTTER, THOUGH. HE HE! YOU ARE A CAREFUL MAN!‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH OBSERVED GAILY ALL OF A SUDDEN. ‚ÄÚLISTEN, OLD FRIEND. I HAD TO GET TO KNOW YOU; THAT‚ÄÔS WHY I TALKED IN MY OWN STYLE. YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE I GET TO KNOW LIKE THAT. MAYBE I NEEDED TO FIND OUT YOUR CHARACTER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS MY CHARACTER TO YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW CAN I TELL WHAT IT MAY BE TO ME?‚ÄÙ HE LAUGHED AGAIN. ‚ÄÚYOU SEE, MY DEAR AND HIGHLY RESPECTED ANDREY ANTONOVITCH, YOU ARE CUNNING, BUT IT‚ÄÔS NOT COME TO THAT YET AND IT CERTAINLY NEVER WILL COME TO IT, YOU UNDERSTAND? PERHAPS YOU DO UNDERSTAND. THOUGH I DID MAKE AN EXPLANATION IN THE PROPER QUARTER WHEN I CAME BACK FROM ABROAD, AND I REALLY DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHY A MAN OF CERTAIN CONVICTIONS SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO WORK FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS SINCERE CONVICTIONS ‚Ä¶ BUT NOBODY THERE HAS YET INSTRUCTED ME TO INVESTIGATE YOUR CHARACTER AND I‚ÄÔVE NOT UNDERTAKEN ANY SUCH JOB FROM THEM. CONSIDER: I NEED NOT HAVE GIVEN THOSE TWO NAMES TO YOU. I MIGHT HAVE GONE STRAIGHT THERE; THAT IS WHERE I MADE MY FIRST EXPLANATIONS. AND IF I‚ÄÔD BEEN ACTING WITH A VIEW TO FINANCIAL PROFIT OR MY OWN INTEREST IN ANY WAY, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BAD SPECULATION ON MY PART, FOR NOW THEY‚ÄÔLL BE GRATEFUL TO YOU AND NOT TO ME AT HEADQUARTERS. I‚ÄÔVE DONE IT SOLELY FOR SHATOV‚ÄÔS SAKE,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH ADDED GENEROUSLY, ‚ÄÚFOR SHATOV‚ÄÔS SAKE, BECAUSE OF OUR OLD FRIENDSHIP.‚Ä¶ BUT WHEN YOU TAKE UP YOUR PEN TO WRITE TO HEADQUARTERS, YOU MAY PUT IN A WORD FOR ME, IF YOU LIKE.‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔLL MAKE NO OBJECTION, HE HE! ADIEU, THOUGH; I‚ÄÔVE STAYED TOO LONG AND THERE WAS NO NEED TO GOSSIP SO MUCH!‚ÄÙ HE ADDED WITH SOME AMIABILITY, AND HE GOT UP FROM THE SOFA.

‚ÄÚON THE CONTRARY, I AM VERY GLAD THAT THE POSITION HAS BEEN DEFINED, SO TO SPEAK.‚ÄÙ VON LEMBKE TOO GOT UP AND HE TOO LOOKED PLEASANT, OBVIOUSLY AFFECTED BY THE LAST WORDS. ‚ÄÚI ACCEPT YOUR SERVICES AND ACKNOWLEDGE MY OBLIGATION, AND YOU MAY BE SURE THAT ANYTHING I CAN DO BY WAY OF REPORTING YOUR ZEAL ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSIX DAYS‚ÄÎTHE GREAT THING IS TO PUT IT OFF FOR SIX DAYS, AND THAT YOU SHOULDN‚ÄÔT STIR FOR THOSE SIX DAYS, THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT I WANT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSO BE IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOF COURSE, I DON‚ÄÔT TIE YOUR HANDS AND SHOULDN‚ÄÔT VENTURE TO. YOU ARE BOUND TO KEEP WATCH, ONLY DON‚ÄÔT FLUTTER THE NEST TOO SOON; I RELY ON YOUR SENSE AND EXPERIENCE FOR THAT. BUT I SHOULD THINK YOU‚ÄÔVE PLENTY OF BLOODHOUNDS AND TRACKERS OF YOUR OWN IN RESERVE, HA HA!‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH BLURTED OUT WITH THE GAIETY AND IRRESPONSIBILITY OF YOUTH.

‚ÄÚNOT QUITE SO.‚ÄÙ LEMBKE PARRIED AMIABLY. ‚ÄÚYOUNG PEOPLE ARE APT TO SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL IN THE BACKGROUND.‚Ä¶ BUT, BY THE WAY, ALLOW ME ONE LITTLE WORD: IF THIS KIRILLOV WAS STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS SECOND, THEN MR. STAVROGIN TOO ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT ABOUT STAVROGIN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI MEAN, IF THEY ARE SUCH FRIENDS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, NO, NO, NO! THERE YOU ARE QUITE OUT OF IT, THOUGH YOU ARE CUNNING. YOU REALLY SURPRISE ME. I THOUGHT THAT YOU HAD SOME INFORMATION ABOUT IT.‚Ä¶ H‚ÄÔM ‚Ä¶ STAVROGIN‚ÄÎIT‚ÄÔS QUITE THE OPPOSITE, QUITE.‚Ä¶ AVIS AU LECTEUR.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDO YOU MEAN IT? AND CAN IT BE SO?‚ÄÙ LEMBKE ARTICULATED MISTRUSTFULLY. ‚ÄÚYULIA MIHAILOVNA TOLD ME THAT FROM WHAT SHE HEARD FROM PETERSBURG HE IS A MAN ACTING ON SOME SORT OF INSTRUCTIONS, SO TO SPEAK.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT; I KNOW NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. ADIEU. AVIS AU LECTEUR!‚ÄÙ ABRUPTLY AND OBVIOUSLY PYOTR STEPANOVITCH DECLINED TO DISCUSS IT.

HE HURRIED TO THE DOOR.

‚ÄÚSTAY, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, STAY,‚ÄÙ CRIED LEMBKE. ‚ÄÚONE OTHER TINY MATTER AND I WON‚ÄÔT DETAIN YOU.‚ÄÙ

HE DREW AN ENVELOPE OUT OF A TABLE DRAWER.

‚ÄÚHERE IS A LITTLE SPECIMEN OF THE SAME KIND OF THING, AND I LET YOU SEE IT TO SHOW HOW COMPLETELY I TRUST YOU. HERE, AND TELL ME YOUR OPINION.‚ÄÙ

IN THE ENVELOPE WAS A LETTER, A STRANGE ANONYMOUS LETTER ADDRESSED TO LEMBKE AND ONLY RECEIVED BY HIM THE DAY BEFORE. WITH INTENSE VEXATION PYOTR STEPANOVITCH READ AS FOLLOWS:

‚ÄÚYOUR EXCELLENCY,‚ÄÎFOR SUCH YOU ARE BY RANK. HEREWITH I MAKE KNOWN THAT THERE IS AN ATTEMPT TO BE MADE ON THE LIFE OF PERSONAGES OF GENERAL‚ÄÔS RANK AND ON THE FATHERLAND. FOR IT‚ÄÔS WORKING UP STRAIGHT FOR THAT. I MYSELF HAVE BEEN DISSEMINATING UNCEASINGLY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THERE‚ÄÔS INFIDELITY TOO. THERE‚ÄÔS A REBELLION BEING GOT UP AND THERE ARE SOME THOUSANDS OF MANIFESTOES, AND FOR EVERY ONE OF THEM THERE WILL BE A HUNDRED RUNNING WITH THEIR TONGUES OUT, UNLESS THEY‚ÄÔVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY BEFOREHAND BY THE POLICE. FOR THEY‚ÄÔVE BEEN PROMISED A MIGHTY LOT OF BENEFITS, AND THE SIMPLE PEOPLE ARE FOOLISH, AND THERE‚ÄÔS VODKA TOO. THE PEOPLE WILL ATTACK ONE AFTER ANOTHER, TAKING THEM TO BE GUILTY, AND, FEARING BOTH SIDES, I REPENT OF WHAT I HAD NO SHARE IN, MY CIRCUMSTANCES BEING WHAT THEY ARE. IF YOU WANT INFORMATION TO SAVE THE FATHERLAND, AND ALSO THE CHURCH AND THE IKONS, I AM THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN DO IT. BUT ONLY ON CONDITION THAT I GET A PARDON FROM THE SECRET POLICE BY TELEGRAM AT ONCE, ME ALONE, BUT THE REST MAY ANSWER FOR IT. PUT A CANDLE EVERY EVENING AT SEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE PORTER‚ÄÔS WINDOW FOR A SIGNAL. SEEING IT, I SHALL BELIEVE AND COME TO KISS THE MERCIFUL HAND FROM PETERSBURG. BUT ON CONDITION THERE‚ÄÔS A PENSION FOR ME, FOR ELSE HOW AM I TO LIVE? YOU WON‚ÄÔT REGRET IT FOR IT WILL MEAN A STAR FOR YOU. YOU MUST GO SECRETLY OR THEY‚ÄÔLL WRING YOUR NECK. YOUR EXCELLENCY‚ÄÔS DESPERATE SERVANT FALLS AT YOUR FEET.

‚ÄÚREPENTANT FREE-THINKER INCOGNITO.‚ÄÙ

VON LEMBKE EXPLAINED THAT THE LETTER HAD MADE ITS APPEARANCE IN THE PORTER‚ÄÔS ROOM WHEN IT WAS LEFT EMPTY THE DAY BEFORE.

‚ÄÚSO WHAT DO YOU THINK?‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH ASKED ALMOST RUDELY.

‚ÄÚI THINK IT‚ÄÔS AN ANONYMOUS SKIT BY WAY OF A HOAX.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMOST LIKELY IT IS. THERE‚ÄÔS NO TAKING YOU IN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT MAKES ME THINK THAT IS THAT IT‚ÄÔS SO STUPID.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHAVE YOU RECEIVED SUCH DOCUMENTS HERE BEFORE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚONCE OR TWICE, ANONYMOUS LETTERS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, OF COURSE THEY WOULDN‚ÄÔT BE SIGNED. IN A DIFFERENT STYLE? IN DIFFERENT HANDWRITINGS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND WERE THEY BUFFOONERY LIKE THIS ONE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, AND YOU KNOW ‚Ä¶ VERY DISGUSTING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, IF YOU HAD THEM BEFORE, IT MUST BE THE SAME THING NOW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT‚ÄÔS SO STUPID. BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE EDUCATED AND WOULDN‚ÄÔT WRITE SO STUPIDLY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOF COURSE, OF COURSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT WHAT IF THIS IS SOMEONE WHO REALLY WANTS TO TURN INFORMER?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS NOT VERY LIKELY,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH RAPPED OUT DRYLY. ‚ÄÚWHAT DOES HE MEAN BY A TELEGRAM FROM THE SECRET POLICE AND A PENSION? IT‚ÄÔS OBVIOUSLY A HOAX.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, YES,‚ÄÙ LEMBKE ADMITTED, ABASHED.

‚ÄÚI TELL YOU WHAT: YOU LEAVE THIS WITH ME. I CAN CERTAINLY FIND OUT FOR YOU BEFORE I TRACK OUT THE OTHERS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTAKE IT,‚ÄÙ LEMBKE ASSENTED, THOUGH WITH SOME HESITATION.

‚ÄÚHAVE YOU SHOWN IT TO ANYONE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIS IT LIKELY! NO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOT TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, HEAVEN FORBID! AND FOR GOD‚ÄÔS SAKE DON‚ÄÔT YOU SHOW IT HER!‚ÄÙ LEMBKE CRIED IN ALARM. ‚ÄÚSHE‚ÄÔLL BE SO UPSET ‚Ä¶ AND WILL BE DREADFULLY ANGRY WITH ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, YOU‚ÄÔLL BE THE FIRST TO CATCH IT; SHE‚ÄÔD SAY YOU BROUGHT IT ON YOURSELF IF PEOPLE WRITE LIKE THAT TO YOU. I KNOW WHAT WOMEN‚ÄÔS LOGIC IS. WELL, GOOD-BYE. I DARE SAY I SHALL BRING YOU THE WRITER IN A COUPLE OF DAYS OR SO. ABOVE ALL, OUR COMPACT!‚ÄÙ

IV

THOUGH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS PERHAPS FAR FROM BEING A STUPID MAN, FEDKA THE CONVICT HAD SAID OF HIM TRULY ‚ÄÚTHAT HE WOULD MAKE UP A MAN HIMSELF AND GO ON LIVING WITH HIM TOO.‚ÄÙ HE CAME AWAY FROM LEMBKE FULLY PERSUADED THAT FOR THE NEXT SIX DAYS, ANYWAY, HE HAD PUT HIS MIND AT REST, AND THIS INTERVAL WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES. BUT IT WAS A FALSE IDEA AND FOUNDED ENTIRELY ON THE FACT THAT HE HAD MADE UP FOR HIMSELF ONCE FOR ALL AN ANDREY ANTONOVITCH WHO WAS A PERFECT SIMPLETON.

LIKE EVERY MORBIDLY SUSPICIOUS MAN, ANDREY ANTONOVITCH WAS ALWAYS EXCEEDINGLY AND JOYFULLY TRUSTFUL THE MOMENT HE GOT ON TO SURE GROUND. THE NEW TURN OF AFFAIRS STRUCK HIM AT FIRST IN A RATHER FAVOURABLE LIGHT IN SPITE OF SOME FRESH AND TROUBLESOME COMPLICATIONS. ANYWAY, HIS FORMER DOUBTS FELL TO THE GROUND. BESIDES, HE HAD BEEN SO TIRED FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS, SO EXHAUSTED AND HELPLESS, THAT HIS SOUL INVOLUNTARILY YEARNED FOR REST. BUT ALAS! HE WAS AGAIN UNEASY. THE LONG TIME HE HAD SPENT IN PETERSBURG HAD LEFT INERADICABLE TRACES IN HIS HEART. THE OFFICIAL AND EVEN THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE ‚ÄÚYOUNGER GENERATION‚ÄÙ WAS FAIRLY FAMILIAR TO HIM‚ÄÎHE WAS A CURIOUS MAN AND USED TO COLLECT MANIFESTOES‚ÄÎBUT HE COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND A WORD OF IT. NOW HE FELT LIKE A MAN LOST IN A FOREST. EVERY INSTINCT TOLD HIM THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS WORDS UTTERLY INCONGRUOUS, ANOMALOUS, AND GROTESQUE, ‚ÄÚTHOUGH THERE‚ÄÔS NO TELLING WHAT MAY NOT HAPPEN WITH THIS ‚ÄÒYOUNGER GENERATION,‚ÄÔ AND THE DEVIL ONLY KNOWS WHAT‚ÄÔS GOING ON AMONG THEM,‚ÄÙ HE MUSED, LOST IN PERPLEXITY.

AND AT THIS MOMENT, TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, BLUM POKED HIS HEAD IN. HE HAD BEEN WAITING NOT FAR OFF THROUGH THE WHOLE OF PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS VISIT. THIS BLUM WAS ACTUALLY A DISTANT RELATION OF ANDREY ANTONOVITCH, THOUGH THE RELATIONSHIP HAD ALWAYS BEEN CAREFULLY AND TIMOROUSLY CONCEALED. I MUST APOLOGISE TO THE READER FOR DEVOTING A FEW WORDS HERE TO THIS INSIGNIFICANT PERSON. BLUM WAS ONE OF THAT STRANGE CLASS OF ‚ÄÚUNFORTUNATE‚ÄÙ GERMANS WHO ARE UNFORTUNATE NOT THROUGH LACK OF ABILITY BUT THROUGH SOME INEXPLICABLE ILL LUCK. ‚ÄÚUNFORTUNATE‚ÄÙ GERMANS ARE NOT A MYTH, BUT REALLY DO EXIST EVEN IN RUSSIA, AND ARE OF A SPECIAL TYPE. ANDREY ANTONOVITCH HAD ALWAYS HAD A QUITE TOUCHING SYMPATHY FOR HIM, AND WHEREVER HE COULD, AS HE ROSE HIMSELF IN THE SERVICE, HAD PROMOTED HIM TO SUBORDINATE POSITIONS UNDER HIM; BUT BLUM HAD NEVER BEEN SUCCESSFUL. EITHER THE POST WAS ABOLISHED AFTER HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO IT, OR A NEW CHIEF TOOK CHARGE OF THE DEPARTMENT; ONCE HE WAS ALMOST ARRESTED BY MISTAKE WITH OTHER PEOPLE. HE WAS PRECISE, BUT HE WAS GLOOMY TO EXCESS AND TO HIS OWN DETRIMENT. HE WAS TALL AND HAD RED HAIR; HE STOOPED AND WAS DEPRESSED AND EVEN SENTIMENTAL; AND IN SPITE OF HIS BEING HUMBLED BY HIS LIFE, HE WAS OBSTINATE AND PERSISTENT AS AN OX, THOUGH ALWAYS AT THE WRONG MOMENT. FOR ANDREY ANTONOVITCH HE, AS WELL AS HIS WIFE AND NUMEROUS FAMILY, HAD CHERISHED FOR MANY YEARS A REVERENT DEVOTION. EXCEPT ANDREY ANTONOVITCH NO ONE HAD EVER LIKED HIM. YULIA MIHAILOVNA WOULD HAVE DISCARDED HIM FROM THE FIRST, BUT COULD NOT OVERCOME HER HUSBAND‚ÄÔS OBSTINACY. IT WAS THE CAUSE OF THEIR FIRST CONJUGAL QUARREL. IT HAD HAPPENED SOON AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE, IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THEIR HONEYMOON, WHEN SHE WAS CONFRONTED WITH BLUM, WHO, TOGETHER WITH THE HUMILIATING SECRET OF HIS RELATIONSHIP, HAD BEEN UNTIL THEN CAREFULLY CONCEALED FROM HER. ANDREY ANTONOVITCH BESOUGHT HER WITH CLASPED HANDS, TOLD HER PATHETICALLY ALL THE STORY OF BLUM AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP FROM CHILDHOOD, BUT YULIA MIHAILOVNA CONSIDERED HERSELF DISGRACED FOREVER, AND EVEN HAD RECOURSE TO FAINTING. VON LEMBKE WOULD NOT BUDGE AN INCH, AND DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP BLUM OR PART FROM HIM FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD, SO THAT SHE WAS SURPRISED AT LAST AND WAS OBLIGED TO PUT UP WITH BLUM. IT WAS SETTLED, HOWEVER, THAT THE RELATIONSHIP SHOULD BE CONCEALED EVEN MORE CAREFULLY THAN BEFORE IF POSSIBLE, AND THAT EVEN BLUM‚ÄÔS CHRISTIAN NAME AND PATRONYMIC SHOULD BE CHANGED, BECAUSE HE TOO WAS FOR SOME REASON CALLED ANDREY ANTONOVITCH. BLUM KNEW NO ONE IN THE TOWN EXCEPT THE GERMAN CHEMIST, HAD NOT CALLED ON ANYONE, AND LED, AS HE ALWAYS DID, A LONELY AND NIGGARDLY EXISTENCE. HE HAD LONG BEEN AWARE OF ANDREY ANTONOVITCH‚ÄÔS LITERARY PECCADILLOES. HE WAS GENERALLY SUMMONED TO LISTEN TO SECRET T√™TE-√†-T√™TE READINGS OF HIS NOVEL; HE WOULD SIT LIKE A POST FOR SIX HOURS AT A STRETCH, PERSPIRING AND STRAINING HIS UTMOST TO KEEP AWAKE AND SMILE. ON REACHING HOME HE WOULD GROAN WITH HIS LONG-LEGGED AND LANKY WIFE OVER THEIR BENEFACTOR‚ÄÔS UNHAPPY WEAKNESS FOR RUSSIAN LITERATURE.

ANDREY ANTONOVITCH LOOKED WITH ANGUISH AT BLUM.

‚ÄÚI BEG YOU TO LEAVE ME ALONE, BLUM,‚ÄÙ HE BEGAN WITH AGITATED HASTE, OBVIOUSLY ANXIOUS TO AVOID ANY RENEWAL OF THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATION WHICH HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED BY PYOTR STEPANOVITCH.

‚ÄÚAND YET THIS MAY BE ARRANGED IN THE MOST DELICATE WAY AND WITH NO PUBLICITY; YOU HAVE FULL POWER.‚ÄÙ BLUM RESPECTFULLY BUT OBSTINATELY INSISTED ON SOME POINT, STOOPING FORWARD AND COMING NEARER AND NEARER BY SMALL STEPS TO ANDREY ANTONOVITCH.

‚ÄÚBLUM, YOU ARE SO DEVOTED TO ME AND SO ANXIOUS TO SERVE ME THAT I AM ALWAYS IN A PANIC WHEN I LOOK AT YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ALWAYS SAY WITTY THINGS, AND SLEEP IN PEACE SATISFIED WITH WHAT YOU‚ÄÔVE SAID, BUT THAT‚ÄÔS HOW YOU DAMAGE YOURSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBLUM, I HAVE JUST CONVINCED MYSELF THAT IT‚ÄÔS QUITE A MISTAKE, QUITE A MISTAKE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOT FROM THE WORDS OF THAT FALSE, VICIOUS YOUNG MAN WHOM YOU SUSPECT YOURSELF? HE HAS WON YOU BY HIS FLATTERING PRAISE OF YOUR TALENT FOR LITERATURE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBLUM, YOU UNDERSTAND NOTHING ABOUT IT; YOUR PROJECT IS ABSURD, I TELL YOU. WE SHALL FIND NOTHING AND THERE WILL BE A FEARFUL UPSET AND LAUGHTER TOO, AND THEN YULIA MIHAILOVNA ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWE SHALL CERTAINLY FIND EVERYTHING WE ARE LOOKING FOR.‚ÄÙ BLUM ADVANCED FIRMLY TOWARDS HIM, LAYING HIS RIGHT HAND ON HIS HEART. ‚ÄÚWE WILL MAKE A SEARCH SUDDENLY EARLY IN THE MORNING, CAREFULLY SHOWING EVERY CONSIDERATION FOR THE PERSON HIMSELF AND STRICTLY OBSERVING ALL THE PRESCRIBED FORMS OF THE LAW. THE YOUNG MEN, LYAMSHIN AND TELYATNIKOV, ASSERT POSITIVELY THAT WE SHALL FIND ALL WE WANT. THEY WERE CONSTANT VISITORS THERE. NOBODY IS FAVOURABLY DISPOSED TO MR. VERHOVENSKY. MADAME STAVROGIN HAS OPENLY REFUSED HIM HER GRACES, AND EVERY HONEST MAN, IF ONLY THERE IS SUCH A ONE IN THIS COARSE TOWN, IS PERSUADED THAT A HOTBED OF INFIDELITY AND SOCIAL DOCTRINES HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONCEALED THERE. HE KEEPS ALL THE FORBIDDEN BOOKS, RYLIEV‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÒREFLECTIONS,‚ÄÔ ALL HERZEN‚ÄÔS WORKS.‚Ä¶ I HAVE AN APPROXIMATE CATALOGUE, IN CASE OF NEED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH HEAVENS! EVERY ONE HAS THESE BOOKS; HOW SIMPLE YOU ARE, MY POOR BLUM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND MANY MANIFESTOES,‚ÄÙ BLUM WENT ON WITHOUT HEEDING THE OBSERVATION. ‚ÄÚWE SHALL END BY CERTAINLY COMING UPON TRACES OF THE REAL MANIFESTOES HERE. THAT YOUNG VERHOVENSKY I FEEL VERY SUSPICIOUS OF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT YOU ARE MIXING UP THE FATHER AND THE SON. THEY ARE NOT ON GOOD TERMS. THE SON OPENLY LAUGHS AT HIS FATHER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS ONLY A MASK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBLUM, YOU‚ÄÔVE SWORN TO TORMENT ME! THINK! HE IS A CONSPICUOUS FIGURE HERE, AFTER ALL. HE‚ÄÔS BEEN A PROFESSOR, HE IS A WELL-KNOWN MAN. HE‚ÄÔLL MAKE SUCH AN UPROAR AND THERE WILL BE SUCH GIBES ALL OVER THE TOWN, AND WE SHALL MAKE A MESS OF IT ALL.‚Ä¶ AND ONLY THINK HOW YULIA MIHAILOVNA WILL TAKE IT.‚ÄÙ BLUM PRESSED FORWARD AND DID NOT LISTEN. ‚ÄÚHE WAS ONLY A LECTURER, ONLY A LECTURER, AND OF A LOW RANK WHEN HE RETIRED.‚ÄÙ HE SMOTE HIMSELF ON THE CHEST. ‚ÄÚHE HAS NO MARKS OF DISTINCTION. HE WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE SERVICE ON SUSPICION OF PLOTS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. HE HAS BEEN UNDER SECRET SUPERVISION, AND UNDOUBTEDLY STILL IS SO. AND IN VIEW OF THE DISORDERS THAT HAVE COME TO LIGHT NOW, YOU ARE UNDOUBTEDLY BOUND IN DUTY. YOU ARE LOSING YOUR CHANCE OF DISTINCTION BY LETTING SLIP THE REAL CRIMINAL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYULIA MIHAILOVNA! GET AWAY, BLUM,‚ÄÙ VON LEMBKE CRIED SUDDENLY, HEARING THE VOICE OF HIS SPOUSE IN THE NEXT ROOM. BLUM STARTED BUT DID NOT GIVE IN.

‚ÄÚALLOW ME, ALLOW ME,‚ÄÙ HE PERSISTED, PRESSING BOTH HANDS STILL MORE TIGHTLY ON HIS CHEST.

‚ÄÚGET AWAY!‚ÄÙ HISSED ANDREY ANTONOVITCH. ‚ÄÚDO WHAT YOU LIKE ‚Ä¶ AFTERWARDS. OH, MY GOD!‚ÄÙ

THE CURTAIN WAS RAISED AND YULIA MIHAILOVNA MADE HER APPEARANCE. SHE STOOD STILL MAJESTICALLY AT THE SIGHT OF BLUM, CASTING A HAUGHTY AND OFFENDED GLANCE AT HIM, AS THOUGH THE VERY PRESENCE OF THIS MAN WAS AN AFFRONT TO HER. BLUM RESPECTFULLY MADE HER A DEEP BOW WITHOUT SPEAKING AND, DOUBLED UP WITH VENERATION, MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR ON TIPTOE WITH HIS ARMS HELD A LITTLE AWAY FROM HIM.

EITHER BECAUSE HE REALLY TOOK ANDREY ANTONOVITCH‚ÄÔS LAST HYSTERICAL OUTBREAK AS A DIRECT PERMISSION TO ACT AS HE WAS ASKING, OR WHETHER HE STRAINED A POINT IN THIS CASE FOR THE DIRECT ADVANTAGE OF HIS BENEFACTOR, BECAUSE HE WAS TOO CONFIDENT THAT SUCCESS WOULD CROWN HIS EFFORTS; ANYWAY, AS WE SHALL SEE LATER ON, THIS CONVERSATION OF THE GOVERNOR WITH HIS SUBORDINATE LED TO A VERY SURPRISING EVENT WHICH AMUSED MANY PEOPLE, BECAME PUBLIC PROPERTY, MOVED YULIA MIHAILOVNA TO FIERCE ANGER, UTTERLY DISCONCERTING ANDREY ANTONOVITCH AND REDUCING HIM AT THE CRUCIAL MOMENT TO A STATE OF DEPLORABLE INDECISION.

V

IT WAS A BUSY DAY FOR PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. FROM VON LEMBKE HE HASTENED TO BOGOYAVLENSKY STREET, BUT AS HE WENT ALONG BYKOVY STREET, PAST THE HOUSE WHERE KARMAZINOV WAS STAYING, HE SUDDENLY STOPPED, GRINNED, AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE. THE SERVANT TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS EXPECTED, WHICH INTERESTED HIM, AS HE HAD SAID NOTHING BEFOREHAND OF HIS COMING.

BUT THE GREAT WRITER REALLY HAD BEEN EXPECTING HIM, NOT ONLY THAT DAY BUT THE DAY BEFORE AND THE DAY BEFORE THAT. THREE DAYS BEFORE HE HAD HANDED HIM HIS MANUSCRIPT MERCI (WHICH HE HAD MEANT TO READ AT THE LITERARY MATIN√©E AT YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS F√™TE). HE HAD DONE THIS OUT OF AMIABILITY, FULLY CONVINCED THAT HE WAS AGREEABLY FLATTERING THE YOUNG MAN‚ÄÔS VANITY BY LETTING HIM READ THE GREAT WORK BEFOREHAND. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD NOTICED LONG BEFORE THAT THIS VAINGLORIOUS, SPOILED GENTLEMAN, WHO WAS SO OFFENSIVELY UNAPPROACHABLE FOR ALL BUT THE ELECT, THIS WRITER ‚ÄÚWITH THE INTELLECT OF A STATESMAN,‚ÄÙ WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO CURRY FAVOUR WITH HIM, EVEN WITH AVIDITY. I BELIEVE THE YOUNG MAN GUESSED AT LAST THAT KARMAZINOV CONSIDERED HIM, IF NOT THE LEADER OF THE WHOLE SECRET REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT IN RUSSIA, AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE MOST DEEPLY INITIATED INTO THE SECRETS OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION WHO HAD AN INCONTESTABLE INFLUENCE ON THE YOUNGER GENERATION. THE STATE OF MIND OF ‚ÄÚTHE CLEVEREST MAN IN RUSSIA‚ÄÙ INTERESTED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, BUT HITHERTO HE HAD, FOR CERTAIN REASONS, AVOIDED EXPLAINING HIMSELF.

THE GREAT WRITER WAS STAYING IN THE HOUSE BELONGING TO HIS SISTER, WHO WAS THE WIFE OF A KAMMERHERR AND HAD AN ESTATE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD. BOTH SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAD THE DEEPEST REVERENCE FOR THEIR ILLUSTRIOUS RELATION, BUT TO THEIR PROFOUND REGRET BOTH OF THEM HAPPENED TO BE IN MOSCOW AT THE TIME OF HIS VISIT, SO THAT THE HONOUR OF RECEIVING HIM FELL TO THE LOT OF AN OLD LADY, A POOR RELATION OF THE KAMMERHERR‚ÄÔS, WHO HAD FOR YEARS LIVED IN THE FAMILY AND LOOKED AFTER THE HOUSEKEEPING. ALL THE HOUSEHOLD HAD MOVED ABOUT ON TIPTOE SINCE KARMAZINOV‚ÄÔS ARRIVAL. THE OLD LADY SENT NEWS TO MOSCOW ALMOST EVERY DAY, HOW HE HAD SLEPT, WHAT HE HAD DEIGNED TO EAT, AND HAD ONCE SENT A TELEGRAM TO ANNOUNCE THAT AFTER A DINNER-PARTY AT THE MAYOR‚ÄÔS HE WAS OBLIGED TO TAKE A SPOONFUL OF A WELL-KNOWN MEDICINE. SHE RARELY PLUCKED UP COURAGE TO ENTER HIS ROOM, THOUGH HE BEHAVED COURTEOUSLY TO HER, BUT DRYLY, AND ONLY TALKED TO HER OF WHAT WAS NECESSARY.

WHEN PYOTR STEPANOVITCH CAME IN, HE WAS EATING HIS MORNING CUTLET WITH HALF A GLASS OF RED WINE. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD BEEN TO SEE HIM BEFORE AND ALWAYS FOUND HIM EATING THIS CUTLET, WHICH HE FINISHED IN HIS PRESENCE WITHOUT EVER OFFERING HIM ANYTHING. AFTER THE CUTLET A LITTLE CUP OF COFFEE WAS SERVED. THE FOOTMAN WHO BROUGHT IN THE DISHES WORE A SWALLOW-TAIL COAT, NOISELESS BOOTS, AND GLOVES.

‚ÄÚHA HA!‚ÄÙ KARMAZINOV GOT UP FROM THE SOFA, WIPING HIS MOUTH WITH A TABLE-NAPKIN, AND CAME FORWARD TO KISS HIM WITH AN AIR OF UNMIXED DELIGHT‚ÄÎAFTER THE CHARACTERISTIC FASHION OF RUSSIANS IF THEY ARE VERY ILLUSTRIOUS. BUT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT, THOUGH KARMAZINOV MADE A SHOW OF KISSING HIM, HE REALLY ONLY PROFFERED HIS CHEEK, AND SO THIS TIME HE DID THE SAME: THE CHEEKS MET. KARMAZINOV DID NOT SHOW THAT HE NOTICED IT, SAT DOWN ON THE SOFA, AND AFFABLY OFFERED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH AN EASY CHAIR FACING HIM, IN WHICH THE LATTER STRETCHED HIMSELF AT ONCE.

‚ÄÚYOU DON‚ÄÔT ‚Ä¶ WOULDN‚ÄÔT LIKE SOME LUNCH?‚ÄÙ INQUIRED KARMAZINOV, ABANDONING HIS USUAL HABIT BUT WITH AN AIR, OF COURSE, WHICH WOULD PROMPT A POLITE REFUSAL. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH AT ONCE EXPRESSED A DESIRE FOR LUNCH. A SHADE OF OFFENDED SURPRISE DARKENED THE FACE OF HIS HOST, BUT ONLY FOR AN INSTANT; HE NERVOUSLY RANG FOR THE SERVANT AND, IN SPITE OF ALL HIS BREEDING, RAISED HIS VOICE SCORNFULLY AS HE GAVE ORDERS FOR A SECOND LUNCH TO BE SERVED.

‚ÄÚWHAT WILL YOU HAVE, CUTLET OR COFFEE?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED ONCE MORE.

‚ÄÚA CUTLET AND COFFEE, AND TELL HIM TO BRING SOME MORE WINE, I AM HUNGRY,‚ÄÙ ANSWERED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, CALMLY SCRUTINISING HIS HOST‚ÄÔS ATTIRE. MR. KARMAZINOV WAS WEARING A SORT OF INDOOR WADDED JACKET WITH PEARL BUTTONS, BUT IT WAS TOO SHORT, WHICH WAS FAR FROM BECOMING TO HIS RATHER COMFORTABLE STOMACH AND THE SOLID CURVES OF HIS HIPS. BUT TASTES DIFFER. OVER HIS KNEES HE HAD A CHECKERED WOOLLEN PLAID REACHING TO THE FLOOR, THOUGH IT WAS WARM IN THE ROOM.

‚ÄÚARE YOU UNWELL?‚ÄÙ COMMENTED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH.

‚ÄÚNO, NOT UNWELL, BUT I AM AFRAID OF BEING SO IN THIS CLIMATE,‚ÄÙ ANSWERED THE WRITER IN HIS SQUEAKY VOICE, THOUGH HE UTTERED EACH WORD WITH A SOFT CADENCE AND AGREEABLE GENTLEMANLY LISP. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE BEEN EXPECTING YOU SINCE YESTERDAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY? I DIDN‚ÄÔT SAY I‚ÄÔD COME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, BUT YOU HAVE MY MANUSCRIPT. HAVE YOU ‚Ä¶ READ IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMANUSCRIPT? WHICH ONE?‚ÄÙ

KARMAZINOV WAS TERRIBLY SURPRISED.

‚ÄÚBUT YOU‚ÄÔVE BROUGHT IT WITH YOU, HAVEN‚ÄÔT YOU?‚ÄÙ HE WAS SO DISTURBED THAT HE EVEN LEFT OFF EATING AND LOOKED AT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WITH A FACE OF DISMAY.

‚ÄÚAH, THAT BONJOUR YOU MEAN.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMERCI.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, ALL RIGHT. I‚ÄÔD QUITE FORGOTTEN IT AND HADN‚ÄÔT READ IT; I HAVEN‚ÄÔT HAD TIME. I REALLY DON‚ÄÔT KNOW, IT‚ÄÔS NOT IN MY POCKETS ‚Ä¶ IT MUST BE ON MY TABLE. DON‚ÄÔT BE UNEASY, IT WILL BE FOUND.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, I‚ÄÔD BETTER SEND TO YOUR ROOMS AT ONCE. IT MIGHT BE LOST; BESIDES, IT MIGHT BE STOLEN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, WHO‚ÄÔD WANT IT! BUT WHY ARE YOU SO ALARMED? WHY, YULIA MIHAILOVNA TOLD ME YOU ALWAYS HAVE SEVERAL COPIES MADE‚ÄÎONE KEPT AT A NOTARY‚ÄÔS ABROAD, ANOTHER IN PETERSBURG, A THIRD IN MOSCOW, AND THEN YOU SEND SOME TO A BANK, I BELIEVE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT MOSCOW MIGHT BE BURNT AGAIN AND MY MANUSCRIPT WITH IT. NO, I‚ÄÔD BETTER SEND AT ONCE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSTAY, HERE IT IS!‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH PULLED A ROLL OF NOTE-PAPER OUT OF A POCKET AT THE BACK OF HIS COAT. ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS A LITTLE CRUMPLED. ONLY FANCY, IT‚ÄÔS BEEN LYING THERE WITH MY POCKET-HANDKERCHIEF EVER SINCE I TOOK IT FROM YOU; I FORGOT IT.‚ÄÙ

KARMAZINOV GREEDILY SNATCHED THE MANUSCRIPT, CAREFULLY EXAMINED IT, COUNTED THE PAGES, AND LAID IT RESPECTFULLY BESIDE HIM ON A SPECIAL TABLE, FOR THE TIME, IN SUCH A WAY THAT HE WOULD NOT LOSE SIGHT OF IT FOR AN INSTANT.

‚ÄÚYOU DON‚ÄÔT READ VERY MUCH, IT SEEMS?‚ÄÙ HE HISSED, UNABLE TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF.

‚ÄÚNO, NOT VERY MUCH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND NOTHING IN THE WAY OF RUSSIAN LITERATURE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIN THE WAY OF RUSSIAN LITERATURE? LET ME SEE, I HAVE READ SOMETHING.‚Ä¶ ‚ÄÒON THE WAY‚ÄÔ OR ‚ÄÒAWAY!‚ÄÔ OR ‚ÄÒAT THE PARTING OF THE WAYS‚ÄÔ‚ÄÎSOMETHING OF THE SORT; I DON‚ÄÔT REMEMBER. IT‚ÄÔS A LONG TIME SINCE I READ IT, FIVE YEARS AGO. I‚ÄÔVE NO TIME.‚ÄÙ

A SILENCE FOLLOWED.

‚ÄÚWHEN I CAME I ASSURED EVERY ONE THAT YOU WERE A VERY INTELLIGENT MAN, AND NOW I BELIEVE EVERY ONE HERE IS WILD OVER YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHANK YOU,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH ANSWERED CALMLY.

LUNCH WAS BROUGHT IN. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH POUNCED ON THE CUTLET WITH EXTRAORDINARY APPETITE, HAD EATEN IT IN A TRICE, TOSSED OFF THE WINE AND SWALLOWED HIS COFFEE.

‚ÄÚTHIS BOOR,‚ÄÙ THOUGHT KARMAZINOV, LOOKING AT HIM ASKANCE AS HE MUNCHED THE LAST MORSEL AND DRAINED THE LAST DROPS‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚTHIS BOOR PROBABLY UNDERSTOOD THE BITING TAUNT IN MY WORDS ‚Ä¶ AND NO DOUBT HE HAS READ THE MANUSCRIPT WITH EAGERNESS; HE IS SIMPLY LYING WITH SOME OBJECT. BUT POSSIBLY HE IS NOT LYING AND IS ONLY GENUINELY STUPID. I LIKE A GENIUS TO BE RATHER STUPID. MAYN‚ÄÔT HE BE A SORT OF GENIUS AMONG THEM? DEVIL TAKE THE FELLOW!‚ÄÙ

HE GOT UP FROM THE SOFA AND BEGAN PACING FROM ONE END OF THE ROOM TO THE OTHER FOR THE SAKE OF EXERCISE, AS HE ALWAYS DID AFTER LUNCH.

‚ÄÚLEAVING HERE SOON?‚ÄÙ ASKED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH FROM HIS EASY CHAIR, LIGHTING A CIGARETTE.

‚ÄÚI REALLY CAME TO SELL AN ESTATE AND I AM IN THE HANDS OF MY BAILIFF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU LEFT, I BELIEVE, BECAUSE THEY EXPECTED AN EPIDEMIC OUT THERE AFTER THE WAR?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚN-NO, NOT ENTIRELY FOR THAT REASON,‚ÄÙ MR. KARMAZINOV WENT ON, UTTERING HIS PHRASES WITH AN AFFABLE INTONATION, AND EACH TIME HE TURNED ROUND IN PACING THE CORNER THERE WAS A FAINT BUT JAUNTY QUIVER OF HIS RIGHT LEG. ‚ÄÚI CERTAINLY INTEND TO LIVE AS LONG AS I CAN.‚ÄÙ HE LAUGHED, NOT WITHOUT VENOM. ‚ÄÚTHERE IS SOMETHING IN OUR RUSSIAN NOBILITY THAT MAKES THEM WEAR OUT VERY QUICKLY, FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW. BUT I WISH TO WEAR OUT AS LATE AS POSSIBLE, AND NOW I AM GOING ABROAD FOR GOOD; THERE THE CLIMATE IS BETTER, THE HOUSES ARE OF STONE, AND EVERYTHING STRONGER. EUROPE WILL LAST MY TIME, I THINK. WHAT DO YOU THINK?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW CAN I TELL?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚH‚ÄÔM. IF THE BABYLON OUT THERE REALLY DOES FALL, AND GREAT WILL BE THE FALL THEREOF (ABOUT WHICH I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU, YET I THINK IT WILL LAST MY TIME), THERE‚ÄÔS NOTHING TO FALL HERE IN RUSSIA, COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING. THERE WON‚ÄÔT BE STONES TO FALL, EVERYTHING WILL CRUMBLE INTO DIRT. HOLY RUSSIA HAS LESS POWER OF RESISTANCE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD. THE RUSSIAN PEASANTRY IS STILL HELD TOGETHER SOMEHOW BY THE RUSSIAN GOD; BUT ACCORDING TO THE LATEST ACCOUNTS THE RUSSIAN GOD IS NOT TO BE RELIED UPON, AND SCARCELY SURVIVED THE EMANCIPATION; IT CERTAINLY GAVE HIM A SEVERE SHOCK. AND NOW, WHAT WITH RAILWAYS, WHAT WITH YOU ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔVE NO FAITH IN THE RUSSIAN GOD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND HOW ABOUT THE EUROPEAN ONE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE IN ANY. I‚ÄÔVE BEEN SLANDERED TO THE YOUTH OF RUSSIA. I‚ÄÔVE ALWAYS SYMPATHISED WITH EVERY MOVEMENT AMONG THEM. I WAS SHOWN THE MANIFESTOES HERE. EVERY ONE LOOKS AT THEM WITH PERPLEXITY BECAUSE THEY ARE FRIGHTENED AT THE WAY THINGS ARE PUT IN THEM, BUT EVERY ONE IS CONVINCED OF THEIR POWER EVEN IF THEY DON‚ÄÔT ADMIT IT TO THEMSELVES. EVERYBODY HAS BEEN ROLLING DOWNHILL, AND EVERY ONE HAS KNOWN FOR AGES THAT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO CLUTCH AT. I AM PERSUADED OF THE SUCCESS OF THIS MYSTERIOUS PROPAGANDA, IF ONLY BECAUSE RUSSIA IS NOW PRE-EMINENTLY THE PLACE IN ALL THE WORLD WHERE ANYTHING YOU LIKE MAY HAPPEN WITHOUT ANY OPPOSITION. I UNDERSTAND ONLY TOO WELL WHY WEALTHY RUSSIANS ALL FLOCK ABROAD, AND MORE AND MORE SO EVERY YEAR. IT‚ÄÔS SIMPLY INSTINCT. IF THE SHIP IS SINKING, THE RATS ARE THE FIRST TO LEAVE IT. HOLY RUSSIA IS A COUNTRY OF WOOD, OF POVERTY ‚Ä¶ AND OF DANGER, THE COUNTRY OF AMBITIOUS BEGGARS IN ITS UPPER CLASSES, WHILE THE IMMENSE MAJORITY LIVE IN POKY LITTLE HUTS. SHE WILL BE GLAD OF ANY WAY OF ESCAPE; YOU HAVE ONLY TO PRESENT IT TO HER. IT‚ÄÔS ONLY THE GOVERNMENT THAT STILL MEANS TO RESIST, BUT IT BRANDISHES ITS CUDGEL IN THE DARK AND HITS ITS OWN MEN. EVERYTHING HERE IS DOOMED AND AWAITING THE END. RUSSIA AS SHE IS HAS NO FUTURE. I HAVE BECOME A GERMAN AND I AM PROUD OF IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT YOU BEGAN ABOUT THE MANIFESTOES. TELL ME EVERYTHING; HOW DO YOU LOOK AT THEM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEVERY ONE IS AFRAID OF THEM, SO THEY MUST BE INFLUENTIAL. THEY OPENLY UNMASK WHAT IS FALSE AND PROVE THAT THERE IS NOTHING TO LAY HOLD OF AMONG US, AND NOTHING TO LEAN UPON. THEY SPEAK ALOUD WHILE ALL IS SILENT. WHAT IS MOST EFFECTIVE ABOUT THEM (IN SPITE OF THEIR STYLE) IS THE INCREDIBLE BOLDNESS WITH WHICH THEY LOOK THE TRUTH STRAIGHT IN THE FACE. TO LOOK FACTS STRAIGHT IN THE FACE IS ONLY POSSIBLE TO RUSSIANS OF THIS GENERATION. NO, IN EUROPE THEY ARE NOT YET SO BOLD; IT IS A REALM OF STONE, THERE THERE IS STILL SOMETHING TO LEAN UPON. SO FAR AS I SEE AND AM ABLE TO JUDGE, THE WHOLE ESSENCE OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTIONARY IDEA LIES IN THE NEGATION OF HONOUR. I LIKE ITS BEING SO BOLDLY AND FEARLESSLY EXPRESSED. NO, IN EUROPE THEY WOULDN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND IT YET, BUT THAT‚ÄÔS JUST WHAT WE SHALL CLUTCH AT. FOR A RUSSIAN A SENSE OF HONOUR IS ONLY A SUPERFLUOUS BURDEN, AND IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN A BURDEN THROUGH ALL HIS HISTORY. THE OPEN ‚ÄÒRIGHT TO DISHONOUR‚ÄÔ WILL ATTRACT HIM MORE THAN ANYTHING. I BELONG TO THE OLDER GENERATION AND, I MUST CONFESS, STILL CLING TO HONOUR, BUT ONLY FROM HABIT. IT IS ONLY THAT I PREFER THE OLD FORMS, GRANTED IT‚ÄÔS FROM TIMIDITY; YOU SEE ONE MUST LIVE SOMEHOW WHAT‚ÄÔS LEFT OF ONE‚ÄÔS LIFE.‚ÄÙ

HE SUDDENLY STOPPED.

‚ÄÚI AM TALKING,‚ÄÙ HE THOUGHT, ‚ÄÚWHILE HE HOLDS HIS TONGUE AND WATCHES ME. HE HAS COME TO MAKE ME ASK HIM A DIRECT QUESTION. AND I SHALL ASK HIM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYULIA MIHAILOVNA ASKED ME BY SOME STRATAGEM TO FIND OUT FROM YOU WHAT THE SURPRISE IS THAT YOU ARE PREPARING FOR THE BALL TO-MORROW,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH ASKED SUDDENLY.

‚ÄÚYES, THERE REALLY WILL BE A SURPRISE AND I CERTAINLY SHALL ASTONISH ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ SAID KARMAZINOV WITH INCREASED DIGNITY. ‚ÄÚBUT I WON‚ÄÔT TELL YOU WHAT THE SECRET IS.‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH DID NOT INSIST.

‚ÄÚTHERE IS A YOUNG MAN HERE CALLED SHATOV,‚ÄÙ OBSERVED THE GREAT WRITER. ‚ÄÚWOULD YOU BELIEVE IT, I HAVEN‚ÄÔT SEEN HIM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚA VERY NICE PERSON. WHAT ABOUT HIM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, NOTHING. HE TALKS ABOUT SOMETHING. ISN‚ÄÔT HE THE PERSON WHO GAVE STAVROGIN THAT SLAP IN THE FACE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND WHAT‚ÄÔS YOUR OPINION OF STAVROGIN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT KNOW; HE IS SUCH A FLIRT.‚ÄÙ

KARMAZINOV DETESTED STAVROGIN BECAUSE IT WAS THE LATTER‚ÄÔS HABIT NOT TO TAKE ANY NOTICE OF HIM.

‚ÄÚTHAT FLIRT,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, CHUCKLING, ‚ÄÚIF WHAT IS ADVOCATED IN YOUR MANIFESTOES EVER COMES TO PASS, WILL BE THE FIRST TO BE HANGED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPERHAPS BEFORE,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SAID SUDDENLY.

‚ÄÚQUITE RIGHT TOO,‚ÄÙ KARMAZINOV ASSENTED, NOT LAUGHING, AND WITH PRONOUNCED GRAVITY.

‚ÄÚYOU HAVE SAID SO ONCE BEFORE, AND, DO YOU KNOW, I REPEATED IT TO HIM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT, YOU SURELY DIDN‚ÄÔT REPEAT IT?‚ÄÙ KARMAZINOV LAUGHED AGAIN.

‚ÄÚHE SAID THAT IF HE WERE TO BE HANGED IT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR YOU TO BE FLOGGED, NOT SIMPLY AS A COMPLEMENT BUT TO HURT, AS THEY FLOG THE PEASANTS.‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH TOOK HIS HAT AND GOT UP FROM HIS SEAT. KARMAZINOV HELD OUT BOTH HANDS TO HIM AT PARTING.

‚ÄÚAND WHAT IF ALL THAT YOU ARE ‚Ä¶ PLOTTING FOR IS DESTINED TO COME TO PASS ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HE PIPED SUDDENLY, IN A HONEYED VOICE WITH A PECULIAR INTONATION, STILL HOLDING HIS HANDS IN HIS. ‚ÄÚHOW SOON COULD IT COME ABOUT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW COULD I TELL?‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH ANSWERED RATHER ROUGHLY. THEY LOOKED INTENTLY INTO EACH OTHER‚ÄÔS EYES.

‚ÄÚAT A GUESS? APPROXIMATELY?‚ÄÙ KARMAZINOV PIPED STILL MORE SWEETLY.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔLL HAVE TIME TO SELL YOUR ESTATE AND TIME TO CLEAR OUT TOO,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH MUTTERED STILL MORE ROUGHLY. THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER EVEN MORE INTENTLY.

THERE WAS A MINUTE OF SILENCE.

‚ÄÚIT WILL BEGIN EARLY NEXT MAY AND WILL BE OVER BY OCTOBER,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SAID SUDDENLY.

‚ÄÚI THANK YOU SINCERELY,‚ÄÙ KARMAZINOV PRONOUNCED IN A VOICE SATURATED WITH FEELING, PRESSING HIS HANDS.

‚ÄÚYOU WILL HAVE TIME TO GET OUT OF THE SHIP, YOU RAT,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS THINKING AS HE WENT OUT INTO THE STREET. ‚ÄÚWELL, IF THAT ‚ÄÒIMPERIAL INTELLECT‚ÄÔ INQUIRES SO CONFIDENTLY OF THE DAY AND THE HOUR AND THANKS ME SO RESPECTFULLY FOR THE INFORMATION I HAVE GIVEN, WE MUSTN‚ÄÔT DOUBT OF OURSELVES. [HE GRINNED.] H‚ÄÔM! BUT HE REALLY ISN‚ÄÔT STUPID ‚Ä¶ AND HE IS SIMPLY A RAT ESCAPING; MEN LIKE THAT DON‚ÄÔT TELL TALES!‚ÄÙ

HE RAN TO FILIPOV‚ÄÔS HOUSE IN BOGOYAVLENSKY STREET.

VI

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WENT FIRST TO KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS. HE FOUND HIM, AS USUAL, ALONE, AND AT THE MOMENT PRACTISING GYMNASTICS, THAT IS, STANDING WITH HIS LEGS APART, BRANDISHING HIS ARMS ABOVE HIS HEAD IN A PECULIAR WAY. ON THE FLOOR LAY A BALL. THE TEA STOOD COLD ON THE TABLE, NOT CLEARED SINCE BREAKFAST. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH STOOD FOR A MINUTE ON THE THRESHOLD.

‚ÄÚYOU ARE VERY ANXIOUS ABOUT YOUR HEALTH, IT SEEMS,‚ÄÙ HE SAID IN A LOUD AND CHEERFUL TONE, GOING INTO THE ROOM. ‚ÄÚWHAT A JOLLY BALL, THOUGH; FOO, HOW IT BOUNCES! IS THAT FOR GYMNASTICS TOO?‚ÄÙ

KIRILLOV PUT ON HIS COAT.

‚ÄÚYES, THAT‚ÄÔS FOR THE GOOD OF MY HEALTH TOO,‚ÄÙ HE MUTTERED DRYLY. ‚ÄÚSIT DOWN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM ONLY HERE FOR A MINUTE. STILL, I‚ÄÔLL SIT DOWN. HEALTH IS ALL VERY WELL, BUT I‚ÄÔVE COME TO REMIND YOU OF OUR AGREEMENT. THE APPOINTED TIME IS APPROACHING ‚Ä¶ IN A CERTAIN SENSE,‚ÄÙ HE CONCLUDED AWKWARDLY.

‚ÄÚWHAT AGREEMENT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW CAN YOU ASK?‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS STARTLED AND EVEN DISMAYED.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS NOT AN AGREEMENT AND NOT AN OBLIGATION. I HAVE NOT BOUND MYSELF IN ANY WAY; IT‚ÄÔS A MISTAKE ON YOUR PART.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SAY, WHAT‚ÄÔS THIS YOU‚ÄÔRE DOING?‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH JUMPED UP.

‚ÄÚWHAT I CHOOSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU CHOOSE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE SAME AS BEFORE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT? DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU ARE IN THE SAME MIND?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES. ONLY THERE‚ÄÔS NO AGREEMENT AND NEVER HAS BEEN, AND I HAVE NOT BOUND MYSELF IN ANY WAY. I COULD DO AS I LIKE AND I CAN STILL DO AS I LIKE.‚ÄÙ

KIRILLOV EXPLAINED HIMSELF CURTLY AND CONTEMPTUOUSLY.

‚ÄÚI AGREE, I AGREE; BE AS FREE AS YOU LIKE IF YOU DON‚ÄÔT CHANGE YOUR MIND.‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SAT DOWN AGAIN WITH A SATISFIED AIR. ‚ÄÚYOU ARE ANGRY OVER A WORD. YOU‚ÄÔVE BECOME VERY IRRITABLE OF LATE; THAT‚ÄÔS WHY I‚ÄÔVE AVOIDED COMING TO SEE YOU. I WAS QUITE SURE, THOUGH, YOU WOULD BE LOYAL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DISLIKE YOU VERY MUCH, BUT YOU CAN BE PERFECTLY SURE‚ÄÎTHOUGH I DON‚ÄÔT REGARD IT AS LOYALTY AND DISLOYALTY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT DO YOU KNOW‚ÄÙ (PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS STARTLED AGAIN) ‚ÄÚWE MUST TALK THINGS OVER THOROUGHLY AGAIN SO AS NOT TO GET IN A MUDDLE. THE BUSINESS NEEDS ACCURACY, AND YOU KEEP GIVING ME SUCH SHOCKS. WILL YOU LET ME SPEAK?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSPEAK,‚ÄÙ SNAPPED KIRILLOV, LOOKING AWAY.

‚ÄÚYOU MADE UP YOUR MIND LONG AGO TO TAKE YOUR LIFE ‚Ä¶ I MEAN, YOU HAD THE IDEA IN YOUR MIND. IS THAT THE RIGHT EXPRESSION? IS THERE ANY MISTAKE ABOUT THAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI HAVE THE SAME IDEA STILL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEXCELLENT. TAKE NOTE THAT NO ONE HAS FORCED IT ON YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚRATHER NOT; WHAT NONSENSE YOU TALK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DARE SAY I EXPRESS IT VERY STUPIDLY. OF COURSE, IT WOULD BE VERY STUPID TO FORCE ANYBODY TO IT. I‚ÄÔLL GO ON. YOU WERE A MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY BEFORE ITS ORGANISATION WAS CHANGED, AND CONFESSED IT TO ONE OF THE MEMBERS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DIDN‚ÄÔT CONFESS IT, I SIMPLY SAID SO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚQUITE SO. AND IT WOULD BE ABSURD TO CONFESS SUCH A THING. WHAT A CONFESSION! YOU SIMPLY SAID SO. EXCELLENT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, IT‚ÄÔS NOT EXCELLENT, FOR YOU ARE BEING TEDIOUS. I AM NOT OBLIGED TO GIVE YOU ANY ACCOUNT OF MYSELF AND YOU CAN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND MY IDEAS. I WANT TO PUT AN END TO MY LIFE, BECAUSE THAT‚ÄÔS MY IDEA, BECAUSE I DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO BE AFRAID OF DEATH, BECAUSE ‚Ä¶ BECAUSE THERE‚ÄÔS NO NEED FOR YOU TO KNOW. WHAT DO YOU WANT? WOULD YOU LIKE TEA? IT‚ÄÔS COLD. LET ME GET YOU ANOTHER GLASS.‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH ACTUALLY HAD TAKEN UP THE TEAPOT AND WAS LOOKING FOR AN EMPTY GLASS. KIRILLOV WENT TO THE CUPBOARD AND BROUGHT A CLEAN GLASS.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE JUST HAD LUNCH AT KARMAZINOV‚ÄÔS,‚ÄÙ OBSERVED HIS VISITOR, ‚ÄÚTHEN I LISTENED TO HIM TALKING, AND PERSPIRED AND GOT INTO A SWEAT AGAIN RUNNING HERE. I AM FEARFULLY THIRSTY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDRINK. COLD TEA IS GOOD.‚ÄÙ

KIRILLOV SAT DOWN ON HIS CHAIR AGAIN AND AGAIN FIXED HIS EYES ON THE FARTHEST CORNER.

‚ÄÚTHE IDEA HAD ARISEN IN THE SOCIETY,‚ÄÙ HE WENT ON IN THE SAME VOICE, ‚ÄÚTHAT I MIGHT BE OF USE IF I KILLED MYSELF, AND THAT WHEN YOU GET UP SOME BIT OF MISCHIEF HERE, AND THEY ARE LOOKING FOR THE GUILTY, I MIGHT SUDDENLY SHOOT MYSELF AND LEAVE A LETTER SAYING I DID IT ALL, SO THAT YOU MIGHT ESCAPE SUSPICION FOR ANOTHER YEAR.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFOR A FEW DAYS, ANYWAY; ONE DAY IS PRECIOUS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGOOD. SO FOR THAT REASON THEY ASKED ME, IF I WOULD, TO WAIT. I SAID I‚ÄÔD WAIT TILL THE SOCIETY FIXED THE DAY, BECAUSE IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, BUT REMEMBER THAT YOU BOUND YOURSELF NOT TO MAKE UP YOUR LAST LETTER WITHOUT ME AND THAT IN RUSSIA YOU WOULD BE AT MY ‚Ä¶ WELL, AT MY DISPOSITION, THAT IS FOR THAT PURPOSE ONLY. I NEED HARDLY SAY, IN EVERYTHING ELSE, OF COURSE, YOU ARE FREE,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH ADDED ALMOST AMIABLY.

‚ÄÚI DIDN‚ÄÔT BIND MYSELF, I AGREED, BECAUSE IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGOOD, GOOD. I HAVE NO INTENTION OF WOUNDING YOUR VANITY, BUT ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS NOT A QUESTION OF VANITY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT REMEMBER THAT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THALERS WERE COLLECTED FOR YOUR JOURNEY, SO YOU‚ÄÔVE TAKEN MONEY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOT AT ALL.‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV FIRED UP. ‚ÄÚTHE MONEY WAS NOT ON THAT CONDITION. ONE DOESN‚ÄÔT TAKE MONEY FOR THAT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPEOPLE SOMETIMES DO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS A LIE. I SENT A LETTER FROM PETERSBURG, AND IN PETERSBURG I PAID YOU A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THALERS; I PUT IT IN YOUR HAND ‚Ä¶ AND IT HAS BEEN SENT OFF THERE, UNLESS YOU‚ÄÔVE KEPT IT FOR YOURSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, I DON‚ÄÔT DISPUTE ANYTHING; IT HAS BEEN SENT OFF. ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT YOU ARE STILL IN THE SAME MIND.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEXACTLY THE SAME. WHEN YOU COME AND TELL ME IT‚ÄÔS TIME, I‚ÄÔLL CARRY IT ALL OUT. WILL IT BE VERY SOON?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOT VERY MANY DAYS.‚Ä¶ BUT REMEMBER, WE‚ÄÔLL MAKE UP THE LETTER TOGETHER, THE SAME NIGHT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE SAME DAY IF YOU LIKE. YOU SAY I MUST TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MANIFESTOES ON MYSELF?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND SOMETHING ELSE TOO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM NOT GOING TO MAKE MYSELF OUT RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT WON‚ÄÔT YOU BE RESPONSIBLE FOR?‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH AGAIN.

‚ÄÚWHAT I DON‚ÄÔT CHOOSE; THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH. I DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT ANY MORE.‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH CONTROLLED HIMSELF AND CHANGED THE SUBJECT.

‚ÄÚTO SPEAK OF SOMETHING ELSE,‚ÄÙ HE BEGAN, ‚ÄÚWILL YOU BE WITH US THIS EVENING? IT‚ÄÔS VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS NAME-DAY; THAT‚ÄÔS THE PRETEXT FOR OUR MEETING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDO ME A FAVOUR. DO COME. YOU MUST. WE MUST IMPRESS THEM BY OUR NUMBER AND OUR LOOKS. YOU HAVE A FACE ‚Ä¶ WELL, IN ONE WORD, YOU HAVE A FATEFUL FACE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU THINK SO?‚ÄÙ LAUGHED KIRILLOV. ‚ÄÚVERY WELL, I‚ÄÔLL COME, BUT NOT FOR THE SAKE OF MY FACE. WHAT TIME IS IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, QUITE EARLY, HALF-PAST SIX. AND, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN GO IN, SIT DOWN, AND NOT SPEAK TO ANY ONE, HOWEVER MANY THERE MAY BE THERE. ONLY, I SAY, DON‚ÄÔT FORGET TO BRING PENCIL AND PAPER WITH YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THAT FOR?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU, AND IT‚ÄÔS MY SPECIAL REQUEST. YOU‚ÄÔLL ONLY HAVE TO SIT STILL, SPEAKING TO NO ONE, LISTEN, AND SOMETIMES SEEM TO MAKE A NOTE. YOU CAN DRAW SOMETHING, IF YOU LIKE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT NONSENSE! WHAT FOR?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, SINCE IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU! YOU KEEP SAYING THAT IT‚ÄÔS JUST THE SAME TO YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, WHAT FOR?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, BECAUSE THAT MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY, THE INSPECTOR, HAS STOPPED AT MOSCOW AND I TOLD SOME OF THEM HERE THAT POSSIBLY THE INSPECTOR MAY TURN UP TO-NIGHT; AND THEY‚ÄÔLL THINK THAT YOU ARE THE INSPECTOR. AND AS YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN HERE THREE WEEKS ALREADY, THEY‚ÄÔLL BE STILL MORE SURPRISED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSTAGE TRICKS. YOU HAVEN‚ÄÔT GOT AN INSPECTOR IN MOSCOW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, SUPPOSE I HAVEN‚ÄÔT‚ÄÎDAMN HIM!‚ÄÎWHAT BUSINESS IS THAT OF YOURS AND WHAT BOTHER WILL IT BE TO YOU? YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY YOURSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTELL THEM I AM THE INSPECTOR; I‚ÄÔLL SIT STILL AND HOLD MY TONGUE, BUT I WON‚ÄÔT HAVE THE PENCIL AND PAPER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT WHY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO.‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS REALLY ANGRY; HE TURNED POSITIVELY GREEN, BUT AGAIN HE CONTROLLED HIMSELF. HE GOT UP AND TOOK HIS HAT.

‚ÄÚIS THAT FELLOW WITH YOU?‚ÄÙ HE BROUGHT OUT SUDDENLY, IN A LOW VOICE.

‚ÄÚYES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS GOOD. I‚ÄÔLL SOON GET HIM AWAY. DON‚ÄÔT BE UNEASY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM NOT UNEASY. HE IS ONLY HERE AT NIGHT. THE OLD WOMAN IS IN THE HOSPITAL, HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW IS DEAD. I‚ÄÔVE BEEN ALONE FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS. I‚ÄÔVE SHOWN HIM THE PLACE IN THE PALING WHERE YOU CAN TAKE A BOARD OUT; HE GETS THROUGH, NO ONE SEES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL TAKE HIM AWAY SOON.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE SAYS HE HAS GOT PLENTY OF PLACES TO STAY THE NIGHT IN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS ROT; THEY ARE LOOKING FOR HIM, BUT HERE HE WOULDN‚ÄÔT BE NOTICED. DO YOU EVER GET INTO TALK WITH HIM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, AT NIGHT. HE ABUSES YOU TREMENDOUSLY. I‚ÄÔVE BEEN READING THE ‚ÄÒAPOCALYPSE‚ÄÔ TO HIM AT NIGHT, AND WE HAVE TEA. HE LISTENED EAGERLY, VERY EAGERLY, THE WHOLE NIGHT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHANG IT ALL, YOU‚ÄÔLL CONVERT HIM TO CHRISTIANITY!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE IS A CHRISTIAN AS IT IS. DON‚ÄÔT BE UNEASY, HE‚ÄÔLL DO THE MURDER. WHOM DO YOU WANT TO MURDER?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, I DON‚ÄÔT WANT HIM FOR THAT, I WANT HIM FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT.‚Ä¶ AND DOES SHATOV KNOW ABOUT FEDKA?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT TALK TO SHATOV, AND I DON‚ÄÔT SEE HIM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIS HE ANGRY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, WE ARE NOT ANGRY, ONLY WE SHUN ONE ANOTHER. WE LAY TOO LONG SIDE BY SIDE IN AMERICA.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM GOING TO HIM DIRECTLY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAS YOU LIKE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSTAVROGIN AND I MAY COME AND SEE YOU FROM THERE, ABOUT TEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WANT TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT.‚Ä¶ I SAY, MAKE ME A PRESENT OF YOUR BALL; WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH IT NOW? I WANT IT FOR GYMNASTICS TOO. I‚ÄÔLL PAY YOU FOR IT IF YOU LIKE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU CAN TAKE IT WITHOUT.‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH PUT THE BALL IN THE BACK POCKET OF HIS COAT.

‚ÄÚBUT I‚ÄÔLL GIVE YOU NOTHING AGAINST STAVROGIN,‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV MUTTERED AFTER HIS GUEST, AS HE SAW HIM OUT. THE LATTER LOOKED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT BUT DID NOT ANSWER.

KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS LAST WORDS PERPLEXED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH EXTREMELY; HE HAD NOT TIME YET TO DISCOVER THEIR MEANING, BUT EVEN WHILE HE WAS ON THE STAIRS OF SHATOV‚ÄÔS LODGING HE TRIED TO REMOVE ALL TRACE OF ANNOYANCE AND TO ASSUME AN AMIABLE EXPRESSION. SHATOV WAS AT HOME AND RATHER UNWELL. HE WAS LYING ON HIS BED, THOUGH DRESSED.

‚ÄÚWHAT BAD LUCK!‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH CRIED OUT IN THE DOORWAY. ‚ÄÚARE YOU REALLY ILL?‚ÄÙ

THE AMIABLE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE SUDDENLY VANISHED; THERE WAS A GLEAM OF SPITE IN HIS EYES.

‚ÄÚNOT AT ALL.‚ÄÙ SHATOV JUMPED UP NERVOUSLY. ‚ÄÚI AM NOT ILL AT ALL ‚Ä¶ A LITTLE HEADACHE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

HE WAS DISCONCERTED; THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF SUCH A VISITOR POSITIVELY ALARMED HIM.

‚ÄÚYOU MUSTN‚ÄÔT BE ILL FOR THE JOB I‚ÄÔVE COME ABOUT,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH BEGAN QUICKLY AND, AS IT WERE, PEREMPTORILY. ‚ÄÚALLOW ME TO SIT DOWN.‚ÄÙ (HE SAT DOWN.) ‚ÄÚAND YOU SIT DOWN AGAIN ON YOUR BEDSTEAD; THAT‚ÄÔS RIGHT. THERE WILL BE A PARTY OF OUR FELLOWS AT VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS TO-NIGHT ON THE PRETEXT OF HIS BIRTHDAY; IT WILL HAVE NO POLITICAL CHARACTER, HOWEVER‚ÄÎWE‚ÄÔVE SEEN TO THAT. I AM COMING WITH NIKOLAY STAVROGIN. I WOULD NOT, OF COURSE, HAVE DRAGGED YOU THERE, KNOWING YOUR WAY OF THINKING AT PRESENT ‚Ä¶ SIMPLY TO SAVE YOUR BEING WORRIED, NOT BECAUSE WE THINK YOU WOULD BETRAY US. BUT AS THINGS HAVE TURNED OUT, YOU WILL HAVE TO GO. YOU‚ÄÔLL MEET THERE THE VERY PEOPLE WITH WHOM WE SHALL FINALLY SETTLE HOW YOU ARE TO LEAVE THE SOCIETY AND TO WHOM YOU ARE TO HAND OVER WHAT IS IN YOUR KEEPING. WE‚ÄÔLL DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED; I‚ÄÔLL TAKE YOU ASIDE INTO A CORNER; THERE‚ÄÔLL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THERE‚ÄÔS NO NEED FOR EVERY ONE TO KNOW. I MUST CONFESS I‚ÄÔVE HAD TO KEEP MY TONGUE WAGGING ON YOUR BEHALF; BUT NOW I BELIEVE THEY‚ÄÔVE AGREED, ON CONDITION YOU HAND OVER THE PRINTING PRESS AND ALL THE PAPERS, OF COURSE. THEN YOU CAN GO WHERE YOU PLEASE.‚ÄÙ

SHATOV LISTENED, FROWNING AND RESENTFUL. THE NERVOUS ALARM OF A MOMENT BEFORE HAD ENTIRELY LEFT HIM.

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT ACKNOWLEDGE ANY SORT OF OBLIGATION TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT TO THE DEVIL KNOWS WHOM,‚ÄÙ HE DECLARED DEFINITELY. ‚ÄÚNO ONE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO SET ME FREE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOT QUITE SO. A GREAT DEAL HAS BEEN ENTRUSTED TO YOU. YOU HADN‚ÄÔT THE RIGHT TO BREAK OFF SIMPLY. BESIDES, YOU MADE NO CLEAR STATEMENT ABOUT IT, SO THAT YOU PUT THEM IN AN AMBIGUOUS POSITION.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI STATED MY POSITION CLEARLY BY LETTER AS SOON AS I ARRIVED HERE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, IT WASN‚ÄÔT CLEAR,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH RETORTED CALMLY. ‚ÄÚI SENT YOU ‚ÄÒA NOBLE PERSONALITY‚ÄÔ TO BE PRINTED HERE, AND MEANING THE COPIES TO BE KEPT HERE TILL THEY WERE WANTED; AND THE TWO MANIFESTOES AS WELL. YOU RETURNED THEM WITH AN AMBIGUOUS LETTER WHICH EXPLAINED NOTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI REFUSED DEFINITELY TO PRINT THEM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, NOT DEFINITELY. YOU WROTE THAT YOU COULDN‚ÄÔT, BUT YOU DIDN‚ÄÔT EXPLAIN FOR WHAT REASON. ‚ÄÒI CAN‚ÄÔT‚ÄÔ DOESN‚ÄÔT MEAN ‚ÄÒI DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO.‚ÄÔ IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED THAT YOU WERE SIMPLY UNABLE THROUGH CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT WAS HOW THEY TOOK IT, AND CONSIDERED THAT YOU STILL MEANT TO KEEP UP YOUR CONNECTION WITH THE SOCIETY, SO THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE ENTRUSTED SOMETHING TO YOU AGAIN AND SO HAVE COMPROMISED THEMSELVES. THEY SAY HERE THAT YOU SIMPLY MEANT TO DECEIVE THEM, SO THAT YOU MIGHT BETRAY THEM WHEN YOU GOT HOLD OF SOMETHING IMPORTANT. I HAVE DEFENDED YOU TO THE BEST OF MY POWERS, AND HAVE SHOWN YOUR BRIEF NOTE AS EVIDENCE IN YOUR FAVOUR. BUT I HAD TO ADMIT ON REREADING THOSE TWO LINES THAT THEY WERE MISLEADING AND NOT CONCLUSIVE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU KEPT THAT NOTE SO CAREFULLY THEN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMY KEEPING IT MEANS NOTHING; I‚ÄÔVE GOT IT STILL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, I DON‚ÄÔT CARE, DAMN IT!‚ÄÙ SHATOV CRIED FURIOUSLY. ‚ÄÚYOUR FOOLS MAY CONSIDER THAT I‚ÄÔVE BETRAYED THEM IF THEY LIKE‚ÄÎWHAT IS IT TO ME? I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO TO ME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOUR NAME WOULD BE NOTED, AND AT THE FIRST SUCCESS OF THE REVOLUTION YOU WOULD BE HANGED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS WHEN YOU GET THE UPPER HAND AND DOMINATE RUSSIA?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU NEEDN‚ÄÔT LAUGH. I TELL YOU AGAIN, I STOOD UP FOR YOU. ANYWAY, I ADVISE YOU TO TURN UP TO-DAY. WHY WASTE WORDS THROUGH FALSE PRIDE? ISN‚ÄÔT IT BETTER TO PART FRIENDS? IN ANY CASE YOU‚ÄÔLL HAVE TO GIVE UP THE PRINTING PRESS AND THE OLD TYPE AND PAPERS‚ÄÎTHAT‚ÄÔS WHAT WE MUST TALK ABOUT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL COME,‚ÄÙ SHATOV MUTTERED, LOOKING DOWN THOUGHTFULLY.

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH GLANCED ASKANCE AT HIM FROM HIS PLACE.

‚ÄÚWILL STAVROGIN BE THERE?‚ÄÙ SHATOV ASKED SUDDENLY, RAISING HIS HEAD.

‚ÄÚHE IS CERTAIN TO BE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHA HA!‚ÄÙ

AGAIN THEY WERE SILENT FOR A MINUTE. SHATOV GRINNED DISDAINFULLY AND IRRITABLY.

‚ÄÚAND THAT CONTEMPTIBLE ‚ÄÒNOBLE PERSONALITY‚ÄÔ OF YOURS, THAT I WOULDN‚ÄÔT PRINT HERE. HAS IT BEEN PRINTED?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED.

‚ÄÚYES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO MAKE THE SCHOOLBOYS BELIEVE THAT HERZEN HIMSELF HAD WRITTEN IT IN YOUR ALBUM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, HERZEN HIMSELF.‚ÄÙ

AGAIN THEY WERE SILENT FOR THREE MINUTES. AT LAST SHATOV GOT UP FROM THE BED.

‚ÄÚGO OUT OF MY ROOM; I DON‚ÄÔT CARE TO SIT WITH YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM GOING,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH BROUGHT OUT WITH POSITIVE ALACRITY, GETTING UP AT ONCE. ‚ÄÚONLY ONE WORD: KIRILLOV IS QUITE ALONE IN THE LODGE NOW, ISN‚ÄÔT HE, WITHOUT A SERVANT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚQUITE ALONE. GET ALONG; I CAN‚ÄÔT STAND BEING IN THE SAME ROOM WITH YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, YOU ARE A PLEASANT CUSTOMER NOW!‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH REFLECTED GAILY AS HE WENT OUT INTO THE STREET, ‚ÄÚAND YOU WILL BE PLEASANT THIS EVENING TOO, AND THAT JUST SUITS ME; NOTHING BETTER COULD BE WISHED, NOTHING BETTER COULD BE WISHED! THE RUSSIAN GOD HIMSELF SEEMS HELPING ME.‚ÄÙ

VII

HE HAD PROBABLY BEEN VERY BUSY THAT DAY ON ALL SORTS OF ERRANDS AND PROBABLY WITH SUCCESS, WHICH WAS REFLECTED IN THE SELF-SATISFIED EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE WHEN AT SIX O‚ÄÔCLOCK THAT EVENING HE TURNED UP AT STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS. BUT HE WAS NOT AT ONCE ADMITTED: STAVROGIN HAD JUST LOCKED HIMSELF IN THE STUDY WITH MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH. THIS NEWS INSTANTLY MADE PYOTR STEPANOVITCH ANXIOUS. HE SEATED HIMSELF CLOSE TO THE STUDY DOOR TO WAIT FOR THE VISITOR TO GO AWAY. HE COULD HEAR CONVERSATION BUT COULD NOT CATCH THE WORDS. THE VISIT DID NOT LAST LONG; SOON HE HEARD A NOISE, THE SOUND OF AN EXTREMELY LOUD AND ABRUPT VOICE, THEN THE DOOR OPENED AND MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH CAME OUT WITH A VERY PALE FACE. HE DID NOT NOTICE PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, AND QUICKLY PASSED BY. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH INSTANTLY RAN INTO THE STUDY.

I CANNOT OMIT A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE VERY BRIEF INTERVIEW THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THE TWO ‚ÄÚRIVALS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAN INTERVIEW WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT WHICH HAD YET TAKEN PLACE.

THIS IS HOW IT HAD COME ABOUT. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAD BEEN ENJOYING AN AFTER-DINNER NAP ON THE COUCH IN HIS STUDY WHEN ALEXEY YEGORYTCH HAD ANNOUNCED THE UNEXPECTED VISITOR. HEARING THE NAME, HE HAD POSITIVELY LEAPT UP, UNWILLING TO BELIEVE IT. BUT SOON A SMILE GLEAMED ON HIS LIPS‚ÄÎA SMILE OF HAUGHTY TRIUMPH AND AT THE SAME TIME OF A BLANK, INCREDULOUS WONDER. THE VISITOR, MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, SEEMED STRUCK BY THE EXPRESSION OF THAT SMILE AS HE CAME IN; ANYWAY, HE STOOD STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AS THOUGH UNCERTAIN WHETHER TO COME FURTHER IN OR TO TURN BACK. STAVROGIN SUCCEEDED AT ONCE IN TRANSFORMING THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE, AND WITH AN AIR OF GRAVE SURPRISE TOOK A STEP TOWARDS HIM. THE VISITOR DID NOT TAKE HIS OUTSTRETCHED HAND, BUT AWKWARDLY MOVED A CHAIR AND, NOT UTTERING A WORD, SAT DOWN WITHOUT WAITING FOR HIS HOST TO DO SO. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SAT DOWN ON THE SOFA FACING HIM OBLIQUELY AND, LOOKING AT MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, WAITED IN SILENCE.

‚ÄÚIF YOU CAN, MARRY LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA,‚ÄÙ MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH BROUGHT OUT SUDDENLY AT LAST, AND WHAT WAS MOST CURIOUS, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL FROM HIS TONE WHETHER IT WAS AN ENTREATY, A RECOMMENDATION, A SURRENDER, OR A COMMAND.

STAVROGIN STILL REMAINED SILENT, BUT THE VISITOR HAD EVIDENTLY SAID ALL HE HAD COME TO SAY AND GAZED AT HIM PERSISTENTLY, WAITING FOR AN ANSWER.

‚ÄÚIF I AM NOT MISTAKEN (BUT IT‚ÄÔS QUITE CERTAIN), LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA IS ALREADY BETROTHED TO YOU,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN SAID AT LAST.

‚ÄÚPROMISED AND BETROTHED,‚ÄÙ MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH ASSENTED FIRMLY AND CLEARLY.

‚ÄÚYOU HAVE ‚Ä¶ QUARRELLED? EXCUSE ME, MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, SHE ‚ÄÒLOVES AND RESPECTS ME‚ÄÔ; THOSE ARE HER WORDS. HER WORDS ARE MORE PRECIOUS THAN ANYTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOF THAT THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT LET ME TELL YOU, IF SHE WERE STANDING IN THE CHURCH AT HER WEDDING AND YOU WERE TO CALL HER, SHE‚ÄÔD GIVE UP ME AND EVERY ONE AND GO TO YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFROM THE WEDDING?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, AND AFTER THE WEDDING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAREN‚ÄÔT YOU MAKING A MISTAKE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO. UNDER HER PERSISTENT, SINCERE, AND INTENSE HATRED FOR YOU LOVE IS FLASHING OUT AT EVERY MOMENT ‚Ä¶ AND MADNESS ‚Ä¶ THE SINCEREST INFINITE LOVE AND ‚Ä¶ MADNESS! ON THE CONTRARY, BEHIND THE LOVE SHE FEELS FOR ME, WHICH IS SINCERE TOO, EVERY MOMENT THERE ARE FLASHES OF HATRED ‚Ä¶ THE MOST INTENSE HATRED! I COULD NEVER HAVE FANCIED ALL THESE TRANSITIONS ‚Ä¶ BEFORE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT I WONDER, THOUGH, HOW COULD YOU COME HERE AND DISPOSE OF THE HAND OF LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA? HAVE YOU THE RIGHT TO DO SO? HAS SHE AUTHORISED YOU?‚ÄÙ

MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH FROWNED AND FOR A MINUTE HE LOOKED DOWN.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS ALL WORDS ON YOUR PART,‚ÄÙ HE BROUGHT OUT SUDDENLY, ‚ÄÚWORDS OF REVENGE AND TRIUMPH; I AM SURE YOU CAN READ BETWEEN THE LINES, AND IS THIS THE TIME FOR PETTY VANITY? HAVEN‚ÄÔT YOU SATISFACTION ENOUGH? MUST I REALLY DOT MY I‚ÄÔS AND GO INTO IT ALL? VERY WELL, I WILL DOT MY I‚ÄÔS, IF YOU ARE SO ANXIOUS FOR MY HUMILIATION. I HAVE NO RIGHT, IT‚ÄÔS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO BE AUTHORISED; LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT AND HER BETROTHED HAS FINALLY LOST HIS SENSES AND IS ONLY FIT FOR A MADHOUSE, AND, TO CROWN EVERYTHING, HAS COME TO TELL YOU SO HIMSELF. YOU ARE THE ONLY MAN IN THE WORLD WHO CAN MAKE HER HAPPY, AND I AM THE ONE TO MAKE HER UNHAPPY. YOU ARE TRYING TO GET HER, YOU ARE PURSUING HER, BUT‚ÄÎI DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHY‚ÄÎYOU WON‚ÄÔT MARRY HER. IF IT‚ÄÔS BECAUSE OF A LOVERS‚ÄÔ QUARREL ABROAD AND I MUST BE SACRIFICED TO END IT, SACRIFICE ME. SHE IS TOO UNHAPPY AND I CAN‚ÄÔT ENDURE IT. MY WORDS ARE NOT A SANCTION, NOT A PRESCRIPTION, AND SO IT‚ÄÔS NO SLUR ON YOUR PRIDE. IF YOU CARE TO TAKE MY PLACE AT THE ALTAR, YOU CAN DO IT WITHOUT ANY SANCTION FROM ME, AND THERE IS NO GROUND FOR ME TO COME TO YOU WITH A MAD PROPOSAL, ESPECIALLY AS OUR MARRIAGE IS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE AFTER THE STEP I AM TAKING NOW. I CANNOT LEAD HER TO THE ALTAR FEELING MYSELF AN ABJECT WRETCH. WHAT I AM DOING HERE AND MY HANDING HER OVER TO YOU, PERHAPS HER BITTEREST FOE, IS TO MY MIND SOMETHING SO ABJECT THAT I SHALL NEVER GET OVER IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWILL YOU SHOOT YOURSELF ON OUR WEDDING DAY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, MUCH LATER. WHY STAIN HER BRIDAL DRESS WITH MY BLOOD? PERHAPS I SHALL NOT SHOOT MYSELF AT ALL, EITHER NOW OR LATER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SUPPOSE YOU WANT TO COMFORT ME BY SAYING THAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU? WHAT WOULD THE BLOOD OF ONE MORE MEAN TO YOU?‚ÄÙ HE TURNED PALE AND HIS EYES GLEAMED. A MINUTE OF SILENCE FOLLOWED.

‚ÄÚEXCUSE ME FOR THE QUESTIONS I‚ÄÔVE ASKED YOU,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN BEGAN AGAIN; ‚ÄÚSOME OF THEM I HAD NO BUSINESS TO ASK YOU, BUT ONE OF THEM I THINK I HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO PUT TO YOU. TELL ME, WHAT FACTS HAVE LED YOU TO FORM A CONCLUSION AS TO MY FEELINGS FOR LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA? I MEAN TO A CONVICTION OF A DEGREE OF FEELING ON MY PART AS WOULD JUSTIFY YOUR COMING HERE ‚Ä¶ AND RISKING SUCH A PROPOSAL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT?‚ÄÙ MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH POSITIVELY STARTED. ‚ÄÚHAVEN‚ÄÔT YOU BEEN TRYING TO WIN HER? AREN‚ÄÔT YOU TRYING TO WIN HER, AND DON‚ÄÔT YOU WANT TO WIN HER?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGENERALLY SPEAKING, I CAN‚ÄÔT SPEAK OF MY FEELING FOR THIS WOMAN OR THAT TO A THIRD PERSON OR TO ANYONE EXCEPT THE WOMAN HERSELF. YOU MUST EXCUSE IT, IT‚ÄÔS A CONSTITUTIONAL PECULIARITY. BUT TO MAKE UP FOR IT, I‚ÄÔLL TELL YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE; I AM MARRIED, AND IT‚ÄÔS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME EITHER TO MARRY OR TO TRY ‚ÄÒTO WIN‚ÄÔ ANYONE.‚ÄÙ

MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH WAS SO ASTOUNDED THAT HE STARTED BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND FOR SOME TIME STARED FIXEDLY INTO STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS FACE.

‚ÄÚONLY FANCY, I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT,‚ÄÙ HE MUTTERED. ‚ÄÚYOU SAID THEN, THAT MORNING, THAT YOU WERE NOT MARRIED ‚Ä¶ AND SO I BELIEVED YOU WERE NOT MARRIED.‚ÄÙ

HE TURNED TERRIBLY PALE; SUDDENLY HE BROUGHT HIS FIST DOWN ON THE TABLE WITH ALL HIS MIGHT.

‚ÄÚIF AFTER THAT CONFESSION YOU DON‚ÄÔT LEAVE LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA ALONE, IF YOU MAKE HER UNHAPPY, I‚ÄÔLL KILL YOU WITH MY STICK LIKE A DOG IN A DITCH!‚ÄÙ

HE JUMPED UP AND WALKED QUICKLY OUT OF THE ROOM. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, RUNNING IN, FOUND HIS HOST IN A MOST UNEXPECTED FRAME OF MIND.

‚ÄÚAH, THAT‚ÄÔS YOU!‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN LAUGHED LOUDLY; HIS LAUGHTER SEEMED TO BE PROVOKED SIMPLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF PYOTR STEPANOVITCH AS HE RAN IN WITH SUCH IMPULSIVE CURIOSITY.

‚ÄÚWERE YOU LISTENING AT THE DOOR? WAIT A BIT. WHAT HAVE YOU COME ABOUT? I PROMISED YOU SOMETHING, DIDN‚ÄÔT I? AH, BAH! I REMEMBER, TO MEET ‚ÄÒOUR FELLOWS.‚ÄÔ LET US GO. I AM DELIGHTED. YOU COULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE THOUGHT OF ANYTHING MORE APPROPRIATE.‚ÄÙ HE SNATCHED UP HIS HAT AND THEY BOTH WENT AT ONCE OUT OF THE HOUSE.

‚ÄÚARE YOU LAUGHING BEFOREHAND AT THE PROSPECT OF SEEING ‚ÄÒOUR FELLOWS‚ÄÔ?‚ÄÙ CHIRPED GAILY PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, DODGING ROUND HIM WITH OBSEQUIOUS ALACRITY, AT ONE MOMENT TRYING TO WALK BESIDE HIS COMPANION ON THE NARROW BRICK PAVEMENT AND AT THE NEXT RUNNING RIGHT INTO THE MUD OF THE ROAD; FOR STAVROGIN WALKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PAVEMENT WITHOUT OBSERVING THAT HE LEFT NO ROOM FOR ANYONE ELSE.

‚ÄÚI AM NOT LAUGHING AT ALL,‚ÄÙ HE ANSWERED LOUDLY AND GAILY; ‚ÄÚON THE CONTRARY, I AM SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE MOST SERIOUS SET OF PEOPLE THERE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒSURLY DULLARDS,‚ÄÔ AS YOU ONCE DEIGNED TO EXPRESS IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOTHING IS MORE AMUSING SOMETIMES THAN A SURLY DULLARD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAH, YOU MEAN MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH? I AM CONVINCED HE CAME TO GIVE UP HIS BETROTHED TO YOU, EH? I EGGED HIM ON TO DO IT, INDIRECTLY, WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT? AND IF HE DOESN‚ÄÔT GIVE HER UP, WE‚ÄÔLL TAKE HER, ANYWAY, WON‚ÄÔT WE‚ÄÎEH?‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH KNEW NO DOUBT THAT HE WAS RUNNING SOME RISK IN VENTURING ON SUCH SALLIES, BUT WHEN HE WAS EXCITED HE PREFERRED TO RISK ANYTHING RATHER THAN TO REMAIN IN UNCERTAINTY. STAVROGIN ONLY LAUGHED.

‚ÄÚYOU STILL RECKON YOU‚ÄÔLL HELP ME?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED.

‚ÄÚIF YOU CALL ME. BUT YOU KNOW THERE‚ÄÔS ONE WAY, AND THE BEST ONE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDO I KNOW YOUR WAY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH NO, THAT‚ÄÔS A SECRET FOR THE TIME. ONLY REMEMBER, A SECRET HAS ITS PRICE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNOW WHAT IT COSTS,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN MUTTERED TO HIMSELF, BUT HE RESTRAINED HIMSELF AND WAS SILENT.

‚ÄÚWHAT IT COSTS? WHAT DID YOU SAY?‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS STARTLED.

‚ÄÚI SAID, ‚ÄÒDAMN YOU AND YOUR SECRET!‚ÄÔ YOU‚ÄÔD BETTER BE TELLING ME WHO WILL BE THERE. I KNOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO A NAME-DAY PARTY, BUT WHO WILL BE THERE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, ALL SORTS! EVEN KIRILLOV.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚALL MEMBERS OF CIRCLES?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHANG IT ALL, YOU ARE IN A HURRY! THERE‚ÄÔS NOT ONE CIRCLE FORMED YET.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW DID YOU MANAGE TO DISTRIBUTE SO MANY MANIFESTOES THEN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHERE WE ARE GOING ONLY FOUR ARE MEMBERS OF THE CIRCLE. THE OTHERS ON PROBATION ARE SPYING ON ONE ANOTHER WITH JEALOUS EAGERNESS, AND BRING REPORTS TO ME. THEY ARE A TRUSTWORTHY SET. IT‚ÄÔS ALL MATERIAL WHICH WE MUST ORGANISE, AND THEN WE MUST CLEAR OUT. BUT YOU WROTE THE RULES YOURSELF, THERE‚ÄÔS NO NEED TO EXPLAIN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚARE THINGS GOING BADLY THEN? IS THERE A HITCH?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGOING? COULDN‚ÄÔT BE BETTER. IT WILL AMUSE YOU: THE FIRST THING WHICH HAS A TREMENDOUS EFFECT IS GIVING THEM TITLES. NOTHING HAS MORE INFLUENCE THAN A TITLE. I INVENT RANKS AND DUTIES ON PURPOSE; I HAVE SECRETARIES, SECRET SPIES, TREASURERS, PRESIDENTS, REGISTRARS, THEIR ASSISTANTS‚ÄÎTHEY LIKE IT AWFULLY, IT‚ÄÔS TAKEN CAPITALLY. THEN, THE NEXT FORCE IS SENTIMENTALISM, OF COURSE. YOU KNOW, AMONGST US SOCIALISM SPREADS PRINCIPALLY THROUGH SENTIMENTALISM. BUT THE TROUBLE IS THESE LIEUTENANTS WHO BITE; SOMETIMES YOU PUT YOUR FOOT IN IT. THEN COME THE OUT-AND-OUT ROGUES; WELL, THEY ARE A GOOD SORT, IF YOU LIKE, AND SOMETIMES VERY USEFUL; BUT THEY WASTE A LOT OF ONE‚ÄÔS TIME, THEY WANT INCESSANT LOOKING AFTER. AND THE MOST IMPORTANT FORCE OF ALL‚ÄÎTHE CEMENT THAT HOLDS EVERYTHING TOGETHER‚ÄÎIS THEIR BEING ASHAMED OF HAVING AN OPINION OF THEIR OWN. THAT IS A FORCE! AND WHOSE WORK IS IT, WHOSE PRECIOUS ACHIEVEMENT IS IT, THAT NOT ONE IDEA OF THEIR OWN IS LEFT IN THEIR HEADS! THEY THINK ORIGINALITY A DISGRACE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF SO, WHY DO YOU TAKE SO MUCH TROUBLE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, IF PEOPLE LIE SIMPLY GAPING AT EVERY ONE, HOW CAN YOU RESIST ANNEXING THEM? CAN YOU SERIOUSLY REFUSE TO BELIEVE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCCESS? YES, YOU HAVE THE FAITH, BUT ONE WANTS WILL. IT‚ÄÔS JUST WITH PEOPLE LIKE THIS THAT SUCCESS IS POSSIBLE. I TELL YOU I COULD MAKE THEM GO THROUGH FIRE; ONE HAS ONLY TO DIN IT INTO THEM THAT THEY ARE NOT ADVANCED ENOUGH. THE FOOLS REPROACH ME THAT I HAVE TAKEN IN EVERY ONE HERE OVER THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND ‚ÄÒTHE INNUMERABLE BRANCHES.‚ÄÔ YOU ONCE BLAMED ME FOR IT YOURSELF, BUT WHERE‚ÄÔS THE DECEPTION? YOU AND I ARE THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND THERE WILL BE AS MANY BRANCHES AS WE LIKE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND ALWAYS THE SAME SORT OF RABBLE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚRAW MATERIAL. EVEN THEY WILL BE OF USE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND YOU ARE STILL RECKONING ON ME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE THE CHIEF, YOU ARE THE HEAD; I SHALL ONLY BE A SUBORDINATE, YOUR SECRETARY. WE SHALL TAKE TO OUR BARQUE, YOU KNOW; THE OARS ARE OF MAPLE, THE SAILS ARE OF SILK, AT THE HELM SITS A FAIR MAIDEN, LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA ‚Ä¶ HANG IT, HOW DOES IT GO IN THE BALLAD?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE IS STUCK,‚ÄÙ LAUGHED STAVROGIN. ‚ÄÚNO, I‚ÄÔD BETTER GIVE YOU MY VERSION. THERE YOU RECKON ON YOUR FINGERS THE FORCES THAT MAKE UP THE CIRCLES. ALL THAT BUSINESS OF TITLES AND SENTIMENTALISM IS A VERY GOOD CEMENT, BUT THERE IS SOMETHING BETTER; PERSUADE FOUR MEMBERS OF THE CIRCLE TO DO FOR A FIFTH ON THE PRETENCE THAT HE IS A TRAITOR, AND YOU‚ÄÔLL TIE THEM ALL TOGETHER WITH THE BLOOD THEY‚ÄÔVE SHED AS THOUGH IT WERE A KNOT. THEY‚ÄÔLL BE YOUR SLAVES, THEY WON‚ÄÔT DARE TO REBEL OR CALL YOU TO ACCOUNT. HA HA HA!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT YOU ‚Ä¶ YOU SHALL PAY FOR THOSE WORDS,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH THOUGHT TO HIMSELF, ‚ÄÚAND THIS VERY EVENING, IN FACT. YOU GO TOO FAR.‚ÄÙ

THIS OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS MUST HAVE BEEN PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS REFLECTION. THEY WERE APPROACHING VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS HOUSE.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE REPRESENTED ME, NO DOUBT, AS A MEMBER FROM ABROAD, AN INSPECTOR IN CONNECTION WITH THE INTERNATIONALE?‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN ASKED SUDDENLY.

‚ÄÚNO, NOT AN INSPECTOR; YOU WON‚ÄÔT BE AN INSPECTOR; BUT YOU ARE ONE OF THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS FROM ABROAD, WHO KNOWS THE MOST IMPORTANT SECRETS‚ÄÎTHAT‚ÄÔS YOUR R√¥LE. YOU ARE GOING TO SPEAK, OF COURSE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS PUT THAT IDEA INTO YOUR HEAD?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOW YOU ARE BOUND TO SPEAK.‚ÄÙ

STAVROGIN POSITIVELY STOOD STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET IN SURPRISE, NOT FAR FROM A STREET LAMP. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH FACED HIS SCRUTINY CALMLY AND DEFIANTLY. STAVROGIN CURSED AND WENT ON.

‚ÄÚAND ARE YOU GOING TO SPEAK?‚ÄÙ HE SUDDENLY ASKED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH.

‚ÄÚNO, I AM GOING TO LISTEN TO YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDAMN YOU, YOU REALLY ARE GIVING ME AN IDEA!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT IDEA?‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH ASKED QUICKLY.

‚ÄÚPERHAPS I WILL SPEAK THERE, BUT AFTERWARDS I WILL GIVE YOU A HIDING‚ÄÎAND A SOUND ONE TOO, YOU KNOW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBY THE WAY, I TOLD KARMAZINOV THIS MORNING THAT YOU SAID HE OUGHT TO BE THRASHED, AND NOT SIMPLY AS A FORM BUT TO HURT, AS THEY FLOG PEASANTS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT I NEVER SAID SUCH A THING; HA HA!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO MATTER. SE NON √® VERO ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, THANKS. I AM TRULY OBLIGED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND ANOTHER THING. DO YOU KNOW, KARMAZINOV SAYS THAT THE ESSENCE OF OUR CREED IS THE NEGATION OF HONOUR, AND THAT BY THE OPEN ADVOCACY OF A RIGHT TO BE DISHONOURABLE A RUSSIAN CAN BE WON OVER MORE EASILY THAN BY ANYTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAN EXCELLENT SAYING! GOLDEN WORDS!‚ÄÙ CRIED STAVROGIN. ‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS HIT THE MARK THERE! THE RIGHT TO DISHONOUR‚ÄÎWHY, THEY‚ÄÔD ALL FLOCK TO US FOR THAT, NOT ONE WOULD STAY BEHIND! AND LISTEN, VERHOVENSKY, YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THE HIGHER POLICE, ARE YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚANYONE WHO HAS A QUESTION LIKE THAT IN HIS MIND DOESN‚ÄÔT UTTER IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI UNDERSTAND, BUT WE ARE BY OURSELVES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, SO FAR I AM NOT ONE OF THE HIGHER POLICE. ENOUGH, HERE WE ARE. COMPOSE YOUR FEATURES, STAVROGIN; I ALWAYS DO MINE WHEN I GO IN. A GLOOMY EXPRESSION, THAT‚ÄÔS ALL, NOTHING MORE IS WANTED; IT‚ÄÔS A VERY SIMPLE BUSINESS.‚ÄÙ





CHAPTER VII. A MEETING

I

VIRGINSKY LIVED IN HIS OWN HOUSE, OR RATHER HIS WIFE‚ÄÔS, IN MURAVYIN STREET. IT WAS A WOODEN HOUSE OF ONE STORY, AND THERE WERE NO LODGERS IN IT. ON THE PRETEXT OF VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS-NAME-DAY PARTY, ABOUT FIFTEEN GUESTS WERE ASSEMBLED; BUT THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS NOT IN THE LEAST LIKE AN ORDINARY PROVINCIAL NAME-DAY PARTY. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THEIR MARRIED LIFE THE HUSBAND AND WIFE HAD AGREED ONCE FOR ALL THAT IT WAS UTTERLY STUPID TO INVITE FRIENDS TO CELEBRATE NAME-DAYS, AND THAT ‚ÄÚTHERE IS NOTHING TO REJOICE ABOUT IN FACT.‚ÄÙ IN A FEW YEARS THEY HAD SUCCEEDED IN COMPLETELY CUTTING THEMSELVES OFF FROM ALL SOCIETY. THOUGH HE WAS A MAN OF SOME ABILITY, AND BY NO MEANS VERY POOR, HE SOMEHOW SEEMED TO EVERY ONE AN ECCENTRIC FELLOW WHO WAS FOND OF SOLITUDE, AND, WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, ‚ÄÚSTUCK UP IN CONVERSATION.‚ÄÙ MADAME VIRGINSKY WAS A MIDWIFE BY PROFESSION‚ÄÎAND BY THAT VERY FACT WAS ON THE LOWEST RUNG OF THE SOCIAL LADDER, LOWER EVEN THAN THE PRIEST‚ÄÔS WIFE IN SPITE OF HER HUSBAND‚ÄÔS RANK AS AN OFFICER. BUT SHE WAS CONSPICUOUSLY LACKING IN THE HUMILITY BEFITTING HER POSITION. AND AFTER HER VERY STUPID AND UNPARDONABLY OPEN LIAISON ON PRINCIPLE WITH CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN, A NOTORIOUS ROGUE, EVEN THE MOST INDULGENT OF OUR LADIES TURNED AWAY FROM HER WITH MARKED CONTEMPT. BUT MADAME VIRGINSKY ACCEPTED ALL THIS AS THOUGH IT WERE WHAT SHE WANTED. IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THOSE VERY LADIES APPLIED TO ARINA PROHOROVNA (THAT IS, MADAME VIRGINSKY) WHEN THEY WERE IN AN INTERESTING CONDITION, RATHER THAN TO ANY ONE OF THE OTHER THREE ACCOUCHEUSES OF THE TOWN. SHE WAS SENT FOR EVEN BY COUNTRY FAMILIES LIVING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, SO GREAT WAS THE BELIEF IN HER KNOWLEDGE, LUCK, AND SKILL IN CRITICAL CASES. IT ENDED IN HER PRACTISING ONLY AMONG THE WEALTHIEST LADIES; SHE WAS GREEDY OF MONEY. FEELING HER POWER TO THE FULL, SHE ENDED BY NOT PUTTING HERSELF OUT FOR ANYONE. POSSIBLY ON PURPOSE, INDEED, IN HER PRACTICE IN THE BEST HOUSES SHE USED TO SCARE NERVOUS PATIENTS BY THE MOST INCREDIBLE AND NIHILISTIC DISREGARD OF GOOD MANNERS, OR BY JEERING AT ‚ÄÚEVERYTHING HOLY,‚ÄÙ AT THE VERY TIME WHEN ‚ÄÚEVERYTHING HOLY‚ÄÙ MIGHT HAVE COME IN MOST USEFUL. OUR TOWN DOCTOR, ROZANOV‚ÄÎHE TOO WAS AN ACCOUCHEUR‚ÄÎASSERTED MOST POSITIVELY THAT ON ONE OCCASION WHEN A PATIENT IN LABOUR WAS CRYING OUT AND CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE ALMIGHTY, A FREE-THINKING SALLY FROM ARINA PROHOROVNA, FIRED OFF LIKE A PISTOL-SHOT, HAD SO TERRIFYING AN EFFECT ON THE PATIENT THAT IT GREATLY ACCELERATED HER DELIVERY.

BUT THOUGH SHE WAS A NIHILIST, MADAME VIRGINSKY DID NOT, WHEN OCCASION AROSE, DISDAIN SOCIAL OR EVEN OLD-FASHIONED SUPERSTITIONS AND CUSTOMS IF THEY COULD BE OF ANY ADVANTAGE TO HERSELF. SHE WOULD NEVER, FOR INSTANCE, HAVE STAYED AWAY FROM A BABY‚ÄÔS CHRISTENING, AND ALWAYS PUT ON A GREEN SILK DRESS WITH A TRAIN AND ADORNED HER CHIGNON WITH CURLS AND RINGLETS FOR SUCH EVENTS, THOUGH AT OTHER TIMES SHE POSITIVELY REVELLED IN SLOVENLINESS. AND THOUGH DURING THE CEREMONY SHE ALWAYS MAINTAINED ‚ÄÚTHE MOST INSOLENT AIR,‚ÄÙ SO THAT SHE PUT THE CLERGY TO CONFUSION, YET WHEN IT WAS OVER SHE INVARIABLY HANDED CHAMPAGNE TO THE GUESTS (IT WAS FOR THAT THAT SHE CAME AND DRESSED UP), AND IT WAS NO USE TRYING TO TAKE THE GLASS WITHOUT A CONTRIBUTION TO HER ‚ÄÚPORRIDGE BOWL.‚ÄÙ

THE GUESTS WHO ASSEMBLED THAT EVENING AT VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS (MOSTLY MEN) HAD A CASUAL AND EXCEPTIONAL AIR. THERE WAS NO SUPPER NOR CARDS. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LARGE DRAWING-ROOM, WHICH WAS PAPERED WITH EXTREMELY OLD BLUE PAPER, TWO TABLES HAD BEEN PUT TOGETHER AND COVERED WITH A LARGE THOUGH NOT QUITE CLEAN TABLE-CLOTH, AND ON THEM TWO SAMOVARS WERE BOILING. THE END OF THE TABLE WAS TAKEN UP BY A HUGE TRAY WITH TWENTY-FIVE GLASSES ON IT AND A BASKET WITH ORDINARY FRENCH BREAD CUT INTO A NUMBER OF SLICES, AS ONE SEES IT IN GENTEEL BOARDING-SCHOOLS FOR BOYS OR GIRLS. THE TEA WAS POURED OUT BY A MAIDEN LADY OF THIRTY, ARINA PROHOROVNA‚ÄÔS SISTER, A SILENT AND MALEVOLENT CREATURE, WITH FLAXEN HAIR AND NO EYEBROWS, WHO SHARED HER SISTER‚ÄÔS PROGRESSIVE IDEAS AND WAS AN OBJECT OF TERROR TO VIRGINSKY HIMSELF IN DOMESTIC LIFE. THERE WERE ONLY THREE LADIES IN THE ROOM: THE LADY OF THE HOUSE, HER EYEBROWLESS SISTER, AND VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS SISTER, A GIRL WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED FROM PETERSBURG. ARINA PROHOROVNA, A GOOD-LOOKING AND BUXOM WOMAN OF SEVEN-AND-TWENTY, RATHER DISHEVELLED, IN AN EVERYDAY GREENISH WOOLLEN DRESS, WAS SITTING SCANNING THE GUESTS WITH HER BOLD EYES, AND HER LOOK SEEMED IN HASTE TO SAY, ‚ÄÚYOU SEE I AM NOT IN THE LEAST AFRAID OF ANYTHING.‚ÄÙ MISS VIRGINSKY, A ROSY-CHEEKED STUDENT AND A NIHILIST, WHO WAS ALSO GOOD-LOOKING, SHORT, PLUMP AND ROUND AS A LITTLE BALL, HAD SETTLED HERSELF BESIDE ARINA PROHOROVNA, ALMOST IN HER TRAVELLING CLOTHES. SHE HELD A ROLL OF PAPER IN HER HAND, AND SCRUTINISED THE GUESTS WITH IMPATIENT AND ROVING EYES. VIRGINSKY HIMSELF WAS RATHER UNWELL THAT EVENING, BUT HE CAME IN AND SAT IN AN EASY CHAIR BY THE TEA-TABLE. ALL THE GUESTS WERE SITTING DOWN TOO, AND THE ORDERLY WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE RANGED ON CHAIRS SUGGESTED A MEETING. EVIDENTLY ALL WERE EXPECTING SOMETHING AND WERE FILLING UP THE INTERVAL WITH LOUD BUT IRRELEVANT CONVERSATION. WHEN STAVROGIN AND VERHOVENSKY APPEARED THERE WAS A SUDDEN HUSH.

BUT I MUST BE ALLOWED TO GIVE A FEW EXPLANATIONS TO MAKE THINGS CLEAR.

I BELIEVE THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE HAD COME TOGETHER IN THE AGREEABLE EXPECTATION OF HEARING SOMETHING PARTICULARLY INTERESTING, AND HAD NOTICE OF IT BEFOREHAND. THEY WERE THE FLOWER OF THE REDDEST RADICALISM OF OUR ANCIENT TOWN, AND HAD BEEN CAREFULLY PICKED OUT BY VIRGINSKY FOR THIS ‚ÄÚMEETING.‚ÄÙ I MAY REMARK, TOO, THAT SOME OF THEM (THOUGH NOT VERY MANY) HAD NEVER VISITED HIM BEFORE. OF COURSE MOST OF THE GUESTS HAD NO CLEAR IDEA WHY THEY HAD BEEN SUMMONED. IT WAS TRUE THAT AT THAT TIME ALL TOOK PYOTR STEPANOVITCH FOR A FULLY AUTHORISED EMISSARY FROM ABROAD; THIS IDEA HAD SOMEHOW TAKEN ROOT AMONG THEM AT ONCE AND NATURALLY FLATTERED THEM. AND YET AMONG THE CITIZENS ASSEMBLED OSTENSIBLY TO KEEP A NAME-DAY, THERE WERE SOME WHO HAD BEEN APPROACHED WITH DEFINITE PROPOSALS. PYOTR VERHOVENSKY HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING TOGETHER A ‚ÄÚQUINTET‚ÄÙ AMONGST US LIKE THE ONE HE HAD ALREADY FORMED IN MOSCOW AND, AS APPEARED LATER, IN OUR PROVINCE AMONG THE OFFICERS. IT WAS SAID THAT HE HAD ANOTHER IN X PROVINCE. THIS QUINTET OF THE ELECT WERE SITTING NOW AT THE GENERAL TABLE, AND VERY SKILFULLY SUCCEEDED IN GIVING THEMSELVES THE AIR OF BEING QUITE ORDINARY PEOPLE, SO THAT NO ONE COULD HAVE KNOWN THEM. THEY WERE‚ÄÎSINCE IT IS NO LONGER A SECRET‚ÄÎFIRST LIPUTIN, THEN VIRGINSKY HIMSELF, THEN SHIGALOV (A GENTLEMAN WITH LONG EARS, THE BROTHER OF MADAME VIRGINSKY), LYAMSHIN, AND LASTLY A STRANGE PERSON CALLED TOLKATCHENKO, A MAN OF FORTY, WHO WAS FAMED FOR HIS VAST KNOWLEDGE OF THE PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY OF THIEVES AND ROBBERS. HE USED TO FREQUENT THE TAVERNS ON PURPOSE (THOUGH NOT ONLY WITH THE OBJECT OF STUDYING THE PEOPLE), AND PLUMED HIMSELF ON HIS SHABBY CLOTHES, TARRED BOOTS, AND CRAFTY WINK AND A FLOURISH OF PEASANT PHRASES. LYAMSHIN HAD ONCE OR TWICE BROUGHT HIM TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS GATHERINGS, WHERE, HOWEVER, HE DID NOT MAKE A GREAT SENSATION. HE USED TO MAKE HIS APPEARANCE IN THE TOWN FROM TIME TO TIME, CHIEFLY WHEN HE WAS OUT OF A JOB; HE WAS EMPLOYED ON THE RAILWAY.

EVERY ONE OF THESE FINE CHAMPIONS HAD FORMED THIS FIRST GROUP IN THE FERVENT CONVICTION THAT THEIR QUINTET WAS ONLY ONE OF HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF SIMILAR GROUPS SCATTERED ALL OVER RUSSIA, AND THAT THEY ALL DEPENDED ON SOME IMMENSE CENTRAL BUT SECRET POWER, WHICH IN ITS TURN WAS INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT ALL OVER EUROPE. BUT I REGRET TO SAY THAT EVEN AT THAT TIME THERE WAS BEGINNING TO BE DISSENSION AMONG THEM. THOUGH THEY HAD EVER SINCE THE SPRING BEEN EXPECTING PYOTR VERHOVENSKY, WHOSE COMING HAD BEEN HERALDED FIRST BY TOLKATCHENKO AND THEN BY THE ARRIVAL OF SHIGALOV, THOUGH THEY HAD EXPECTED EXTRAORDINARY MIRACLES FROM HIM, AND THOUGH THEY HAD RESPONDED TO HIS FIRST SUMMONS WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST CRITICISM, YET THEY HAD NO SOONER FORMED THE QUINTET THAN THEY ALL SOMEHOW SEEMED TO FEEL INSULTED; AND I REALLY BELIEVE IT WAS OWING TO THE PROMPTITUDE WITH WHICH THEY CONSENTED TO JOIN. THEY HAD JOINED, OF COURSE, FROM A NOT IGNOBLE FEELING OF SHAME, FOR FEAR PEOPLE MIGHT SAY AFTERWARDS THAT THEY HAD NOT DARED TO JOIN; STILL THEY FELT PYOTR VERHOVENSKY OUGHT TO HAVE APPRECIATED THEIR HEROISM AND HAVE REWARDED IT BY TELLING THEM SOME REALLY IMPORTANT BITS OF NEWS AT LEAST. BUT VERHOVENSKY WAS NOT AT ALL INCLINED TO SATISFY THEIR LEGITIMATE CURIOSITY, AND TOLD THEM NOTHING BUT WHAT WAS NECESSARY; HE TREATED THEM IN GENERAL WITH GREAT STERNNESS AND EVEN RATHER CASUALLY. THIS WAS POSITIVELY IRRITATING, AND COMRADE SHIGALOV WAS ALREADY EGGING THE OTHERS ON TO INSIST ON HIS ‚ÄÚEXPLAINING HIMSELF,‚ÄÙ THOUGH, OF COURSE, NOT AT VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS, WHERE SO MANY OUTSIDERS WERE PRESENT.

I HAVE AN IDEA THAT THE ABOVE-MENTIONED MEMBERS OF THE FIRST QUINTET WERE DISPOSED TO SUSPECT THAT AMONG THE GUESTS OF VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS THAT EVENING SOME WERE MEMBERS OF OTHER GROUPS, UNKNOWN TO THEM, BELONGING TO THE SAME SECRET ORGANISATION AND FOUNDED IN THE TOWN BY THE SAME VERHOVENSKY; SO THAT IN FACT ALL PRESENT WERE SUSPECTING ONE ANOTHER, AND POSED IN VARIOUS WAYS TO ONE ANOTHER, WHICH GAVE THE WHOLE PARTY A VERY PERPLEXING AND EVEN ROMANTIC AIR. YET THERE WERE PERSONS PRESENT WHO WERE BEYOND ALL SUSPICION. FOR INSTANCE, A MAJOR IN THE SERVICE, A NEAR RELATION OF VIRGINSKY, A PERFECTLY INNOCENT PERSON WHO HAD NOT BEEN INVITED BUT HAD COME OF HIMSELF FOR THE NAME-DAY CELEBRATION, SO THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO RECEIVE HIM. BUT VIRGINSKY WAS QUITE UNPERTURBED, AS THE MAJOR WAS ‚ÄÚINCAPABLE OF BETRAYING THEM‚ÄÙ; FOR IN SPITE OF HIS STUPIDITY HE HAD ALL HIS LIFE BEEN FOND OF DROPPING IN WHEREVER EXTREME RADICALS MET; HE DID NOT SYMPATHISE WITH THEIR IDEAS HIMSELF, BUT WAS VERY FOND OF LISTENING TO THEM. WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, HE HAD EVEN BEEN COMPROMISED INDEED. IT HAD HAPPENED IN HIS YOUTH THAT WHOLE BUNDLES OF MANIFESTOES AND OF NUMBERS OF THE BELL HAD PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS, AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN AFRAID EVEN TO OPEN THEM, YET HE WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED IT ABSOLUTELY CONTEMPTIBLE TO REFUSE TO DISTRIBUTE THEM‚ÄÎAND THERE ARE SUCH PEOPLE IN RUSSIA EVEN TO THIS DAY.

THE REST OF THE GUESTS WERE EITHER TYPES OF HONOURABLE AMOUR-PROPRE CRUSHED AND EMBITTERED, OR TYPES OF THE GENEROUS IMPULSIVENESS OF ARDENT YOUTH. THERE WERE TWO OR THREE TEACHERS, OF WHOM ONE, A LAME MAN OF FORTY-FIVE, A MASTER IN THE HIGH SCHOOL, WAS A VERY MALICIOUS AND STRIKINGLY VAIN PERSON; AND TWO OR THREE OFFICERS. OF THE LATTER, ONE VERY YOUNG ARTILLERY OFFICER WHO HAD ONLY JUST COME FROM A MILITARY TRAINING SCHOOL, A SILENT LAD WHO HAD NOT YET MADE FRIENDS WITH ANYONE, TURNED UP NOW AT VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS WITH A PENCIL IN HIS HAND, AND, SCARCELY TAKING ANY PART IN THE CONVERSATION, CONTINUALLY MADE NOTES IN HIS NOTEBOOK. EVERYBODY SAW THIS, BUT EVERY ONE PRETENDED NOT TO. THERE WAS, TOO, AN IDLE DIVINITY STUDENT WHO HAD HELPED LYAMSHIN TO PUT INDECENT PHOTOGRAPHS INTO THE GOSPEL-WOMAN‚ÄÔS PACK. HE WAS A SOLID YOUTH WITH A FREE-AND-EASY THOUGH MISTRUSTFUL MANNER, WITH AN UNCHANGEABLY SATIRICAL SMILE, TOGETHER WITH A CALM AIR OF TRIUMPHANT FAITH IN HIS OWN PERFECTION. THERE WAS ALSO PRESENT, I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHY, THE MAYOR‚ÄÔS SON, THAT UNPLEASANT AND PREMATURELY EXHAUSTED YOUTH TO WHOM I HAVE REFERRED ALREADY IN TELLING THE STORY OF THE LIEUTENANT‚ÄÔS LITTLE WIFE. HE WAS SILENT THE WHOLE EVENING. FINALLY THERE WAS A VERY ENTHUSIASTIC AND TOUSLE-HEADED SCHOOLBOY OF EIGHTEEN, WHO SAT WITH THE GLOOMY AIR OF A YOUNG MAN WHOSE DIGNITY HAS BEEN WOUNDED, EVIDENTLY DISTRESSED BY HIS EIGHTEEN YEARS. THIS INFANT WAS ALREADY THE HEAD OF AN INDEPENDENT GROUP OF CONSPIRATORS WHICH HAD BEEN FORMED IN THE HIGHEST CLASS OF THE GYMNASIUM, AS IT CAME OUT AFTERWARDS TO THE SURPRISE OF EVERY ONE.

I HAVEN‚ÄÔT MENTIONED SHATOV. HE WAS THERE AT THE FARTHEST CORNER OF THE TABLE, HIS CHAIR PUSHED BACK A LITTLE OUT OF THE ROW. HE GAZED AT THE GROUND, WAS GLOOMILY SILENT, REFUSED TEA AND BREAD, AND DID NOT FOR ONE INSTANT LET HIS CAP GO OUT OF HIS HAND, AS THOUGH TO SHOW THAT HE WAS NOT A VISITOR, BUT HAD COME ON BUSINESS, AND WHEN HE LIKED WOULD GET UP AND GO AWAY. KIRILLOV WAS NOT FAR FROM HIM. HE, TOO, WAS VERY SILENT, BUT HE DID NOT LOOK AT THE GROUND; ON THE CONTRARY, HE SCRUTINISED INTENTLY EVERY SPEAKER WITH HIS FIXED, LUSTRELESS EYES, AND LISTENED TO EVERYTHING WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST EMOTION OR SURPRISE. SOME OF THE VISITORS WHO HAD NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE STOLE THOUGHTFUL GLANCES AT HIM. I CAN‚ÄÔT SAY WHETHER MADAME VIRGINSKY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE QUINTET. I IMAGINE SHE KNEW EVERYTHING AND FROM HER HUSBAND. THE GIRL-STUDENT, OF COURSE, TOOK NO PART IN ANYTHING; BUT SHE HAD AN ANXIETY OF HER OWN: SHE INTENDED TO STAY ONLY A DAY OR TWO AND THEN TO GO ON FARTHER AND FARTHER FROM ONE UNIVERSITY TOWN TO ANOTHER ‚ÄÚTO SHOW ACTIVE SYMPATHY WITH THE SUFFERINGS OF POOR STUDENTS AND TO ROUSE THEM TO PROTEST.‚ÄÙ SHE WAS TAKING WITH HER SOME HUNDREDS OF COPIES OF A LITHOGRAPHED APPEAL, I BELIEVE OF HER OWN COMPOSITION. IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE SCHOOLBOY CONCEIVED AN ALMOST MURDEROUS HATRED FOR HER FROM THE FIRST MOMENT, THOUGH HE SAW HER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE; AND SHE FELT THE SAME FOR HIM. THE MAJOR WAS HER UNCLE, AND MET HER TO-DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER TEN YEARS. WHEN STAVROGIN AND VERHOVENSKY CAME IN, HER CHEEKS WERE AS RED AS CRANBERRIES: SHE HAD JUST QUARRELLED WITH HER UNCLE OVER HIS VIEWS ON THE WOMAN QUESTION.

II

WITH CONSPICUOUS NONCHALANCE VERHOVENSKY LOUNGED IN THE CHAIR AT THE UPPER END OF THE TABLE, ALMOST WITHOUT GREETING ANYONE. HIS EXPRESSION WAS DISDAINFUL AND EVEN HAUGHTY. STAVROGIN BOWED POLITELY, BUT IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THEY WERE ALL ONLY WAITING FOR THEM, EVERYBODY, AS THOUGH ACTING ON INSTRUCTION, APPEARED SCARCELY TO NOTICE THEM. THE LADY OF THE HOUSE TURNED SEVERELY TO STAVROGIN AS SOON AS HE WAS SEATED.

‚ÄÚSTAVROGIN, WILL YOU HAVE TEA?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPLEASE,‚ÄÙ HE ANSWERED.

‚ÄÚTEA FOR STAVROGIN,‚ÄÙ SHE COMMANDED HER SISTER AT THE SAMOVAR. ‚ÄÚAND YOU, WILL YOU?‚ÄÙ (THIS WAS TO VERHOVENSKY.)

‚ÄÚOF COURSE. WHAT A QUESTION TO ASK A VISITOR! AND GIVE ME CREAM TOO; YOU ALWAYS GIVE ONE SUCH FILTHY STUFF BY WAY OF TEA, AND WITH A NAME-DAY PARTY IN THE HOUSE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT, YOU BELIEVE IN KEEPING NAME-DAYS TOO!‚ÄÙ THE GIRL-STUDENT LAUGHED SUDDENLY. ‚ÄÚWE WERE JUST TALKING OF THAT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS STALE,‚ÄÙ MUTTERED THE SCHOOLBOY AT THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE.

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS STALE? TO DISREGARD CONVENTIONS, EVEN THE MOST INNOCENT IS NOT STALE; ON THE CONTRARY, TO THE DISGRACE OF EVERY ONE, SO FAR IT‚ÄÔS A NOVELTY,‚ÄÙ THE GIRL-STUDENT ANSWERED INSTANTLY, DARTING FORWARD ON HER CHAIR. ‚ÄÚBESIDES, THERE ARE NO INNOCENT CONVENTIONS,‚ÄÙ SHE ADDED WITH INTENSITY.

‚ÄÚI ONLY MEANT,‚ÄÙ CRIED THE SCHOOLBOY WITH TREMENDOUS EXCITEMENT, ‚ÄÚTO SAY THAT THOUGH CONVENTIONS OF COURSE ARE STALE AND MUST BE ERADICATED, YET ABOUT NAME-DAYS EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THEY ARE STUPID AND VERY STALE TO WASTE PRECIOUS TIME UPON, WHICH HAS BEEN WASTED ALREADY ALL OVER THE WORLD, SO THAT IT WOULD BE AS WELL TO SHARPEN ONE‚ÄÔS WITS ON SOMETHING MORE USEFUL.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU DRAG IT OUT SO, ONE CAN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN,‚ÄÙ SHOUTED THE GIRL.

‚ÄÚI THINK THAT EVERY ONE HAS A RIGHT TO EXPRESS AN OPINION AS WELL AS EVERY ONE ELSE, AND IF I WANT TO EXPRESS MY OPINION LIKE ANYBODY ELSE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO ONE IS ATTACKING YOUR RIGHT TO GIVE AN OPINION,‚ÄÙ THE LADY OF THE HOUSE HERSELF CUT IN SHARPLY. ‚ÄÚYOU WERE ONLY ASKED NOT TO RAMBLE BECAUSE NO ONE CAN MAKE OUT WHAT YOU MEAN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT ALLOW ME TO REMARK THAT YOU ARE NOT TREATING ME WITH RESPECT. IF I COULDN‚ÄÔT FULLY EXPRESS MY THOUGHT, IT‚ÄÔS NOT FROM WANT OF THOUGHT BUT FROM TOO MUCH THOUGHT,‚ÄÙ THE SCHOOLBOY MUTTERED, ALMOST IN DESPAIR, LOSING HIS THREAD COMPLETELY.

‚ÄÚIF YOU DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HOW TO TALK, YOU‚ÄÔD BETTER KEEP QUIET,‚ÄÙ BLURTED OUT THE GIRL.

THE SCHOOLBOY POSITIVELY JUMPED FROM HIS CHAIR.

‚ÄÚI ONLY WANTED TO STATE,‚ÄÙ HE SHOUTED, CRIMSON WITH SHAME AND AFRAID TO LOOK ABOUT HIM, ‚ÄÚTHAT YOU ONLY WANTED TO SHOW OFF YOUR CLEVERNESS BECAUSE MR. STAVROGIN CAME IN‚ÄÎSO THERE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS A NASTY AND IMMORAL IDEA AND SHOWS THE WORTHLESSNESS OF YOUR DEVELOPMENT. I BEG YOU NOT TO ADDRESS ME AGAIN,‚ÄÙ THE GIRL RATTLED OFF.

‚ÄÚSTAVROGIN,‚ÄÙ BEGAN THE LADY OF THE HOUSE, ‚ÄÚTHEY‚ÄÔVE BEEN DISCUSSING THE RIGHTS OF THE FAMILY BEFORE YOU CAME‚ÄÎTHIS OFFICER HERE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎSHE NODDED TOWARDS HER RELATION, THE MAJOR‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚAND, OF COURSE, I AM NOT GOING TO WORRY YOU WITH SUCH STALE NONSENSE, WHICH HAS BEEN DEALT WITH LONG AGO. BUT HOW HAVE THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE FAMILY COME ABOUT IN THE SUPERSTITIOUS FORM IN WHICH THEY EXIST AT PRESENT? THAT‚ÄÔS THE QUESTION. WHAT‚ÄÔS YOUR OPINION?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ‚ÄÒCOME ABOUT‚ÄÔ?‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN ASKED IN HIS TURN.

‚ÄÚWE KNOW, FOR INSTANCE, THAT THE SUPERSTITION ABOUT GOD CAME FROM THUNDER AND LIGHTNING.‚ÄÙ THE GIRL-STUDENT RUSHED INTO THE FRAY AGAIN, STARING AT STAVROGIN WITH HER EYES ALMOST JUMPING OUT OF HER HEAD. ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS WELL KNOWN THAT PRIMITIVE MAN, SCARED BY THUNDER AND LIGHTNING, MADE A GOD OF THE UNSEEN ENEMY, FEELING THEIR WEAKNESS BEFORE IT. BUT HOW DID THE SUPERSTITION OF THE FAMILY ARISE? HOW DID THE FAMILY ITSELF ARISE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS NOT QUITE THE SAME THING.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ MADAME VIRGINSKY TRIED TO CHECK HER.

‚ÄÚI THINK THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULDN‚ÄÔT BE QUITE DISCREET,‚ÄÙ ANSWERED STAVROGIN.

‚ÄÚHOW SO?‚ÄÙ SAID THE GIRL-STUDENT, CRANING FORWARD SUDDENLY. BUT THERE WAS AN AUDIBLE TITTER IN THE GROUP OF TEACHERS, WHICH WAS AT ONCE CAUGHT UP AT THE OTHER END BY LYAMSHIN AND THE SCHOOLBOY AND FOLLOWED BY A HOARSE CHUCKLE FROM THE MAJOR.

‚ÄÚYOU OUGHT TO WRITE VAUDEVILLES,‚ÄÙ MADAME VIRGINSKY OBSERVED TO STAVROGIN.

‚ÄÚIT DOES YOU NO CREDIT, I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT YOUR NAME IS,‚ÄÙ THE GIRL RAPPED OUT WITH POSITIVE INDIGNATION.

‚ÄÚAND DON‚ÄÔT YOU BE TOO FORWARD,‚ÄÙ BOOMED THE MAJOR. ‚ÄÚYOU ARE A YOUNG LADY AND YOU OUGHT TO BEHAVE MODESTLY, AND YOU KEEP JUMPING ABOUT AS THOUGH YOU WERE SITTING ON A NEEDLE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚKINDLY HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND DON‚ÄÔT ADDRESS ME FAMILIARLY WITH YOUR NASTY COMPARISONS. I‚ÄÔVE NEVER SEEN YOU BEFORE AND I DON‚ÄÔT RECOGNISE THE RELATIONSHIP.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT I AM YOUR UNCLE; I USED TO CARRY YOU ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE A BABY!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT CARE WHAT BABIES YOU USED TO CARRY ABOUT. I DIDN‚ÄÔT ASK YOU TO CARRY ME. IT MUST HAVE BEEN A PLEASURE TO YOU TO DO SO, YOU RUDE OFFICER. AND ALLOW ME TO OBSERVE, DON‚ÄÔT DARE TO ADDRESS ME SO FAMILIARLY, UNLESS IT‚ÄÔS AS A FELLOW-CITIZEN. I FORBID YOU TO DO IT, ONCE FOR ALL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHERE, THEY ARE ALL LIKE THAT!‚ÄÙ CRIED THE MAJOR, BANGING THE TABLE WITH HIS FIST AND ADDRESSING STAVROGIN, WHO WAS SITTING OPPOSITE. ‚ÄÚBUT, ALLOW ME, I AM FOND OF LIBERALISM AND MODERN IDEAS, AND I AM FOND OF LISTENING TO CLEVER CONVERSATION; MASCULINE CONVERSATION, THOUGH, I WARN YOU. BUT TO LISTEN TO THESE WOMEN, THESE NIGHTLY WINDMILLS‚ÄÎNO, THAT MAKES ME ACHE ALL OVER! DON‚ÄÔT WRIGGLE ABOUT!‚ÄÙ HE SHOUTED TO THE GIRL, WHO WAS LEAPING UP FROM HER CHAIR. ‚ÄÚNO, IT‚ÄÔS MY TURN TO SPEAK, I‚ÄÔVE BEEN INSULTED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU CAN‚ÄÔT SAY ANYTHING YOURSELF, AND ONLY HINDER OTHER PEOPLE TALKING,‚ÄÙ THE LADY OF THE HOUSE GRUMBLED INDIGNANTLY.

‚ÄÚNO, I WILL HAVE MY SAY,‚ÄÙ SAID THE MAJOR HOTLY, ADDRESSING STAVROGIN. ‚ÄÚI RECKON ON YOU, MR. STAVROGIN, AS A FRESH PERSON WHO HAS ONLY JUST COME ON THE SCENE, THOUGH I HAVEN‚ÄÔT THE HONOUR OF KNOWING YOU. WITHOUT MEN THEY‚ÄÔLL PERISH LIKE FLIES‚ÄÎTHAT‚ÄÔS WHAT I THINK. ALL THEIR WOMAN QUESTION IS ONLY LACK OF ORIGINALITY. I ASSURE YOU THAT ALL THIS WOMAN QUESTION HAS BEEN INVENTED FOR THEM BY MEN IN FOOLISHNESS AND TO THEIR OWN HURT. I ONLY THANK GOD I AM NOT MARRIED. THERE‚ÄÔS NOT THE SLIGHTEST VARIETY IN THEM, THEY CAN‚ÄÔT EVEN INVENT A SIMPLE PATTERN; THEY HAVE TO GET MEN TO INVENT THEM FOR THEM! HERE I USED TO CARRY HER IN MY ARMS, USED TO DANCE THE MAZURKA WITH HER WHEN SHE WAS TEN YEARS OLD; TO-DAY SHE‚ÄÔS COME, NATURALLY I FLY TO EMBRACE HER, AND AT THE SECOND WORD SHE TELLS ME THERE‚ÄÔS NO GOD. SHE MIGHT HAVE WAITED A LITTLE, SHE WAS IN TOO GREAT A HURRY! CLEVER PEOPLE DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE, I DARE SAY; BUT THAT‚ÄÔS FROM THEIR CLEVERNESS. BUT YOU, CHICKEN, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT GOD, I SAID TO HER. ‚ÄÒSOME STUDENT TAUGHT YOU, AND IF HE‚ÄÔD TAUGHT YOU TO LIGHT THE LAMP BEFORE THE IKONS YOU WOULD HAVE LIGHTED IT.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU KEEP TELLING LIES, YOU ARE A VERY SPITEFUL PERSON. I PROVED TO YOU JUST NOW THE UNTENABILITY OF YOUR POSITION,‚ÄÙ THE GIRL ANSWERED CONTEMPTUOUSLY, AS THOUGH DISDAINING FURTHER EXPLANATIONS WITH SUCH A MAN. ‚ÄÚI TOLD YOU JUST NOW THAT WE‚ÄÔVE ALL BEEN TAUGHT IN THE CATECHISM IF YOU HONOUR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR PARENTS YOU WILL LIVE LONG AND HAVE WEALTH. THAT‚ÄÔS IN THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. IF GOD THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO OFFER REWARDS FOR LOVE, YOUR GOD MUST BE IMMORAL. THAT‚ÄÔS HOW I PROVED IT TO YOU. IT WASN‚ÄÔT THE SECOND WORD, AND IT WAS BECAUSE YOU ASSERTED YOUR RIGHTS. IT‚ÄÔS NOT MY FAULT IF YOU ARE STUPID AND DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND EVEN NOW. YOU ARE OFFENDED AND YOU ARE SPITEFUL‚ÄÎAND THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT EXPLAINS ALL YOUR GENERATION.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔRE A GOOSE!‚ÄÙ SAID THE MAJOR.

‚ÄÚAND YOU ARE A FOOL!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU CAN CALL ME NAMES!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEXCUSE ME, KAPITON MAXIMITCH, YOU TOLD ME YOURSELF YOU DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE IN GOD,‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN PIPED FROM THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE.

‚ÄÚWHAT IF I DID SAY SO‚ÄÎTHAT‚ÄÔS A DIFFERENT MATTER. I BELIEVE, PERHAPS, ONLY NOT ALTOGETHER. EVEN IF I DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE ALTOGETHER, STILL I DON‚ÄÔT SAY GOD OUGHT TO BE SHOT. I USED TO THINK ABOUT GOD BEFORE I LEFT THE HUSSARS. FROM ALL THE POEMS YOU WOULD THINK THAT HUSSARS DO NOTHING BUT CAROUSE AND DRINK. YES, I DID DRINK, MAYBE, BUT WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT, I USED TO JUMP OUT OF BED AT NIGHT AND STOOD CROSSING MYSELF BEFORE THE IMAGES WITH NOTHING BUT MY SOCKS ON, PRAYING TO GOD TO GIVE ME FAITH; FOR EVEN THEN I COULDN‚ÄÔT BE AT PEACE AS TO WHETHER THERE WAS A GOD OR NOT. IT USED TO FRET ME SO! IN THE MORNING, OF COURSE, ONE WOULD AMUSE ONESELF AND ONE‚ÄÔS FAITH WOULD SEEM TO BE LOST AGAIN; AND IN FACT I‚ÄÔVE NOTICED THAT FAITH ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE LESS IN THE DAYTIME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHAVEN‚ÄÔT YOU ANY CARDS?‚ÄÙ ASKED VERHOVENSKY, WITH A MIGHTY YAWN, ADDRESSING MADAME VIRGINSKY.

‚ÄÚI SYMPATHISE WITH YOUR QUESTION, I SYMPATHISE ENTIRELY,‚ÄÙ THE GIRL-STUDENT BROKE IN HOTLY, FLUSHED WITH INDIGNATION AT THE MAJOR‚ÄÔS WORDS.

‚ÄÚWE ARE WASTING PRECIOUS TIME LISTENING TO SILLY TALK,‚ÄÙ SNAPPED OUT THE LADY OF THE HOUSE, AND SHE LOOKED REPROVINGLY AT HER HUSBAND.

THE GIRL PULLED HERSELF TOGETHER.

‚ÄÚI WANTED TO MAKE A STATEMENT TO THE MEETING CONCERNING THE SUFFERINGS OF THE STUDENTS AND THEIR PROTEST, BUT AS TIME IS BEING WASTED IN IMMORAL CONVERSATION ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHERE‚ÄÔS NO SUCH THING AS MORAL OR IMMORAL,‚ÄÙ THE SCHOOLBOY BROUGHT OUT, UNABLE TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF AS SOON AS THE GIRL BEGAN.

‚ÄÚI KNEW THAT, MR. SCHOOLBOY, LONG BEFORE YOU WERE TAUGHT IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND I MAINTAIN,‚ÄÙ HE ANSWERED SAVAGELY, ‚ÄÚTHAT YOU ARE A CHILD COME FROM PETERSBURG TO ENLIGHTEN US ALL, THOUGH WE KNOW FOR OURSELVES THE COMMANDMENT ‚ÄÒHONOUR THY FATHER AND THY MOTHER,‚ÄÔ WHICH YOU COULD NOT REPEAT CORRECTLY; AND THE FACT THAT IT‚ÄÔS IMMORAL EVERY ONE IN RUSSIA KNOWS FROM BYELINSKY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚARE WE EVER TO HAVE AN END OF THIS?‚ÄÙ MADAME VIRGINSKY SAID RESOLUTELY TO HER HUSBAND. AS THE HOSTESS, SHE BLUSHED FOR THE INEPTITUDE OF THE CONVERSATION, ESPECIALLY AS SHE NOTICED SMILES AND EVEN ASTONISHMENT AMONG THE GUESTS WHO HAD BEEN INVITED FOR THE FIRST TIME.

‚ÄÚGENTLEMEN,‚ÄÙ SAID VIRGINSKY, SUDDENLY LIFTING UP HIS VOICE, ‚ÄÚIF ANYONE WISHES TO SAY ANYTHING MORE NEARLY CONNECTED WITH OUR BUSINESS, OR HAS ANY STATEMENT TO MAKE, I CALL UPON HIM TO DO SO WITHOUT WASTING TIME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL VENTURE TO ASK ONE QUESTION,‚ÄÙ SAID THE LAME TEACHER SUAVELY. HE HAD BEEN SITTING PARTICULARLY DECOROUSLY AND HAD NOT SPOKEN TILL THEN. ‚ÄÚI SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW, ARE WE SOME SORT OF MEETING, OR ARE WE SIMPLY A GATHERING OF ORDINARY MORTALS PAYING A VISIT? I ASK SIMPLY FOR THE SAKE OF ORDER AND SO AS NOT TO REMAIN IN IGNORANCE.‚ÄÙ

THIS ‚ÄÚSLY‚ÄÙ QUESTION MADE AN IMPRESSION. PEOPLE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER, EVERY ONE EXPECTING SOMEONE ELSE TO ANSWER, AND SUDDENLY ALL, AS THOUGH AT A WORD OF COMMAND, TURNED THEIR EYES TO VERHOVENSKY AND STAVROGIN.

‚ÄÚI SUGGEST OUR VOTING ON THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHETHER WE ARE A MEETING OR NOT,‚ÄÙ SAID MADAME VIRGINSKY.

‚ÄÚI ENTIRELY AGREE WITH THE SUGGESTION,‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN CHIMED IN, ‚ÄÚTHOUGH THE QUESTION IS RATHER VAGUE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AGREE TOO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND SO DO I,‚ÄÙ CRIED VOICES. ‚ÄÚI TOO THINK IT WOULD MAKE OUR PROCEEDINGS MORE IN ORDER,‚ÄÙ CONFIRMED VIRGINSKY.

‚ÄÚTO THE VOTE THEN,‚ÄÙ SAID HIS WIFE. ‚ÄÚLYAMSHIN, PLEASE SIT DOWN TO THE PIANO; YOU CAN GIVE YOUR VOTE FROM THERE WHEN THE VOTING BEGINS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAGAIN!‚ÄÙ CRIED LYAMSHIN. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE STRUMMED ENOUGH FOR YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI BEG YOU MOST PARTICULARLY, SIT DOWN AND PLAY. DON‚ÄÔT YOU CARE TO DO ANYTHING FOR THE CAUSE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT I ASSURE YOU, ARINA PROHOROVNA, NOBODY IS EAVESDROPPING. IT‚ÄÔS ONLY YOUR FANCY. BESIDES, THE WINDOWS ARE HIGH, AND PEOPLE WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND IF THEY DID HEAR.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWE DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND OURSELVES,‚ÄÙ SOMEONE MUTTERED. ‚ÄÚBUT I TELL YOU ONE MUST ALWAYS BE ON ONE‚ÄÔS GUARD. I MEAN IN CASE THERE SHOULD BE SPIES,‚ÄÙ SHE EXPLAINED TO VERHOVENSKY. ‚ÄÚLET THEM HEAR FROM THE STREET THAT WE HAVE MUSIC AND A NAME-DAY PARTY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHANG IT ALL!‚ÄÙ LYAMSHIN SWORE, AND SITTING DOWN TO THE PIANO, BEGAN STRUMMING A VALSE, BANGING ON THE KEYS ALMOST WITH HIS FISTS, AT RANDOM.

‚ÄÚI PROPOSE THAT THOSE WHO WANT IT TO BE A MEETING SHOULD PUT UP THEIR RIGHT HANDS,‚ÄÙ MADAME VIRGINSKY PROPOSED.

SOME PUT THEM UP, OTHERS DID NOT. SOME HELD THEM UP AND THEN PUT THEM DOWN AGAIN AND THEN HELD THEM UP AGAIN. ‚ÄÚFOO! I DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL,‚ÄÙ ONE OFFICER SHOUTED. ‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT EITHER,‚ÄÙ CRIED THE OTHER.

‚ÄÚOH, I UNDERSTAND,‚ÄÙ CRIED A THIRD. ‚ÄÚIF IT‚ÄÔS YES, YOU HOLD YOUR HAND UP.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT WHAT DOES ‚ÄÒYES‚ÄÔ MEAN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMEANS A MEETING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, IT MEANS NOT A MEETING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI VOTED FOR A MEETING,‚ÄÙ CRIED THE SCHOOLBOY TO MADAME VIRGINSKY.

‚ÄÚTHEN WHY DIDN‚ÄÔT YOU HOLD UP YOUR HAND?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WAS LOOKING AT YOU. YOU DIDN‚ÄÔT HOLD UP YOURS, SO I DIDN‚ÄÔT HOLD UP MINE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW STUPID! I DIDN‚ÄÔT HOLD UP MY HAND BECAUSE I PROPOSED IT. GENTLEMEN, NOW I PROPOSE THE CONTRARY. THOSE WHO WANT A MEETING, SIT STILL AND DO NOTHING; THOSE WHO DON‚ÄÔT, HOLD UP THEIR RIGHT HANDS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHOSE WHO DON‚ÄÔT WANT IT?‚ÄÙ INQUIRED THE SCHOOLBOY. ‚ÄÚARE YOU DOING IT ON PURPOSE?‚ÄÙ CRIED MADAME VIRGINSKY WRATHFULLY.

‚ÄÚNO. EXCUSE ME, THOSE WHO WANT IT, OR THOSE WHO DON‚ÄÔT WANT IT? FOR ONE MUST KNOW THAT DEFINITELY,‚ÄÙ CRIED TWO OR THREE VOICES.

‚ÄÚTHOSE WHO DON‚ÄÔT WANT IT‚ÄÎTHOSE WHO DON‚ÄÔT WANT IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, BUT WHAT IS ONE TO DO, HOLD UP ONE‚ÄÔS HAND OR NOT HOLD IT UP IF ONE DOESN‚ÄÔT WANT IT?‚ÄÙ CRIED AN OFFICER.

‚ÄÚECH, WE ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO CONSTITUTIONAL METHODS YET!‚ÄÙ REMARKED THE MAJOR.

‚ÄÚMR. LYAMSHIN, EXCUSE ME, BUT YOU ARE THUMPING SO THAT NO ONE CAN HEAR ANYTHING,‚ÄÙ OBSERVED THE LAME TEACHER.

‚ÄÚBUT, UPON MY WORD, ARINA PROHOROVNA, NOBODY IS LISTENING, REALLY!‚ÄÙ CRIED LYAMSHIN, JUMPING UP. ‚ÄÚI WON‚ÄÔT PLAY! I‚ÄÔVE COME TO YOU AS A VISITOR, NOT AS A DRUMMER!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGENTLEMEN,‚ÄÙ VIRGINSKY WENT ON, ‚ÄÚANSWER VERBALLY, ARE WE A MEETING OR NOT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWE ARE! WE ARE!‚ÄÙ WAS HEARD ON ALL SIDES. ‚ÄÚIF SO, THERE‚ÄÔS NO NEED TO VOTE, THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH. ARE YOU SATISFIED, GENTLEMEN? IS THERE ANY NEED TO PUT IT TO THE VOTE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO NEED‚ÄÎNO NEED, WE UNDERSTAND.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPERHAPS SOMEONE DOESN‚ÄÔT WANT IT TO BE A MEETING?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, NO; WE ALL WANT IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT WHAT DOES ‚ÄÒMEETING‚ÄÔ MEAN?‚ÄÙ CRIED A VOICE. NO ONE ANSWERED.

‚ÄÚWE MUST CHOOSE A CHAIRMAN,‚ÄÙ PEOPLE CRIED FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ROOM.

‚ÄÚOUR HOST, OF COURSE, OUR HOST!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGENTLEMEN, IF SO,‚ÄÙ VIRGINSKY, THE CHOSEN CHAIRMAN, BEGAN, ‚ÄÚI PROPOSE MY ORIGINAL MOTION. IF ANYONE WANTS TO SAY ANYTHING MORE RELEVANT TO THE SUBJECT, OR HAS SOME STATEMENT TO MAKE, LET HIM BRING IT FORWARD WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME.‚ÄÙ

THERE WAS A GENERAL SILENCE. THE EYES OF ALL WERE TURNED AGAIN ON VERHOVENSKY AND STAVROGIN.

‚ÄÚVERHOVENSKY, HAVE YOU NO STATEMENT TO MAKE?‚ÄÙ MADAME VIRGINSKY ASKED HIM DIRECTLY.

‚ÄÚNOTHING WHATEVER,‚ÄÙ HE ANSWERED, YAWNING AND STRETCHING ON HIS CHAIR. ‚ÄÚBUT I SHOULD LIKE A GLASS OF BRANDY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSTAVROGIN, DON‚ÄÔT YOU WANT TO?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHANK YOU, I DON‚ÄÔT DRINK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI MEAN DON‚ÄÔT YOU WANT TO SPEAK, NOT DON‚ÄÔT YOU WANT BRANDY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO SPEAK, WHAT ABOUT? NO, I DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEY‚ÄÔLL BRING YOU SOME BRANDY,‚ÄÙ SHE ANSWERED VERHOVENSKY.

THE GIRL-STUDENT GOT UP. SHE HAD DARTED UP SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY.

‚ÄÚI HAVE COME TO MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT THE SUFFERINGS OF POOR STUDENTS AND THE MEANS OF ROUSING THEM TO PROTEST.‚ÄÙ

BUT SHE BROKE OFF. AT THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE A RIVAL HAD RISEN, AND ALL EYES TURNED TO HIM. SHIGALOV, THE MAN WITH THE LONG EARS, SLOWLY ROSE FROM HIS SEAT WITH A GLOOMY AND SULLEN AIR AND MOURNFULLY LAID ON THE TABLE A THICK NOTEBOOK FILLED WITH EXTREMELY SMALL HANDWRITING. HE REMAINED STANDING IN SILENCE. MANY PEOPLE LOOKED AT THE NOTEBOOK IN CONSTERNATION, BUT LIPUTIN, VIRGINSKY, AND THE LAME TEACHER SEEMED PLEASED.

‚ÄÚI ASK LEAVE TO ADDRESS THE MEETING,‚ÄÙ SHIGALOV PRONOUNCED SULLENLY BUT RESOLUTELY.

‚ÄÚYOU HAVE LEAVE.‚ÄÙ VIRGINSKY GAVE HIS SANCTION.

THE ORATOR SAT DOWN, WAS SILENT FOR HALF A MINUTE, AND PRONOUNCED IN A SOLEMN VOICE,

‚ÄÚGENTLEMEN!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHERE‚ÄÔS THE BRANDY,‚ÄÙ THE SISTER WHO HAD BEEN POURING OUT TEA AND HAD GONE TO FETCH BRANDY RAPPED OUT, CONTEMPTUOUSLY AND DISDAINFULLY PUTTING THE BOTTLE BEFORE VERHOVENSKY, TOGETHER WITH THE WINEGLASS WHICH SHE BROUGHT IN HER FINGERS WITHOUT A TRAY OR A PLATE.

THE INTERRUPTED ORATOR MADE A DIGNIFIED PAUSE.

‚ÄÚNEVER MIND, GO ON, I AM NOT LISTENING,‚ÄÙ CRIED VERHOVENSKY, POURING HIMSELF OUT A GLASS.

‚ÄÚGENTLEMEN, ASKING YOUR ATTENTION AND, AS YOU WILL SEE LATER, SOLICITING YOUR AID IN A MATTER OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE,‚ÄÙ SHIGALOV BEGAN AGAIN, ‚ÄÚI MUST MAKE SOME PREFATORY REMARKS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚARINA PROHOROVNA, HAVEN‚ÄÔT YOU SOME SCISSORS?‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH ASKED SUDDENLY.

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU WANT SCISSORS FOR?‚ÄÙ SHE ASKED, WITH WIDE-OPEN EYES.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE FORGOTTEN TO CUT MY NAILS; I‚ÄÔVE BEEN MEANING TO FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS,‚ÄÙ HE OBSERVED, SCRUTINISING HIS LONG AND DIRTY NAILS WITH UNRUFFLED COMPOSURE.

ARINA PROHOROVNA CRIMSONED, BUT MISS VIRGINSKY SEEMED PLEASED.

‚ÄÚI BELIEVE I SAW THEM JUST NOW ON THE WINDOW.‚ÄÙ SHE GOT UP FROM THE TABLE, WENT AND FOUND THE SCISSORS, AND AT ONCE BROUGHT THEM. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH DID NOT EVEN LOOK AT HER, TOOK THE SCISSORS, AND SET TO WORK WITH THEM. ARINA PROHOROVNA GRASPED THAT THESE WERE REALISTIC MANNERS, AND WAS ASHAMED OF HER SENSITIVENESS. PEOPLE LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN SILENCE. THE LAME TEACHER LOOKED VINDICTIVELY AND ENVIOUSLY AT VERHOVENSKY. SHIGALOV WENT ON.

‚ÄÚDEDICATING MY ENERGIES TO THE STUDY OF THE SOCIAL ORGANISATION WHICH IS IN THE FUTURE TO REPLACE THE PRESENT CONDITION OF THINGS, I‚ÄÔVE COME TO THE CONVICTION THAT ALL MAKERS OF SOCIAL SYSTEMS FROM ANCIENT TIMES UP TO THE PRESENT YEAR, 187-, HAVE BEEN DREAMERS, TELLERS OF FAIRY-TALES, FOOLS WHO CONTRADICTED THEMSELVES, WHO UNDERSTOOD NOTHING OF NATURAL SCIENCE AND THE STRANGE ANIMAL CALLED MAN. PLATO, ROUSSEAU, FOURIER, COLUMNS OF ALUMINIUM, ARE ONLY FIT FOR SPARROWS AND NOT FOR HUMAN SOCIETY. BUT, NOW THAT WE ARE ALL AT LAST PREPARING TO ACT, A NEW FORM OF SOCIAL ORGANISATION IS ESSENTIAL. IN ORDER TO AVOID FURTHER UNCERTAINTY, I PROPOSE MY OWN SYSTEM OF WORLD-ORGANISATION. HERE IT IS.‚ÄÙ HE TAPPED THE NOTEBOOK. ‚ÄÚI WANTED TO EXPOUND MY VIEWS TO THE MEETING IN THE MOST CONCISE FORM POSSIBLE, BUT I SEE THAT I SHOULD NEED TO ADD A GREAT MANY VERBAL EXPLANATIONS, AND SO THE WHOLE EXPOSITION WOULD OCCUPY AT LEAST TEN EVENINGS, ONE FOR EACH OF MY CHAPTERS.‚ÄÙ (THERE WAS THE SOUND OF LAUGHTER.) ‚ÄÚI MUST ADD, BESIDES, THAT MY SYSTEM IS NOT YET COMPLETE.‚ÄÙ (LAUGHTER AGAIN.) ‚ÄÚI AM PERPLEXED BY MY OWN DATA AND MY CONCLUSION IS A DIRECT CONTRADICTION OF THE ORIGINAL IDEA WITH WHICH I START. STARTING FROM UNLIMITED FREEDOM, I ARRIVE AT UNLIMITED DESPOTISM. I WILL ADD, HOWEVER, THAT THERE CAN BE NO SOLUTION OF THE SOCIAL PROBLEM BUT MINE.‚ÄÙ

THE LAUGHTER GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER, BUT IT CAME CHIEFLY FROM THE YOUNGER AND LESS INITIATED VISITORS. THERE WAS AN EXPRESSION OF SOME ANNOYANCE ON THE FACES OF MADAME VIRGINSKY, LIPUTIN, AND THE LAME TEACHER.

‚ÄÚIF YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL IN MAKING YOUR SYSTEM CONSISTENT, AND HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO DESPAIR YOURSELF, WHAT COULD WE DO WITH IT?‚ÄÙ ONE OFFICER OBSERVED WARILY.

‚ÄÚYOU ARE RIGHT, MR. OFFICER‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎSHIGALOV TURNED SHARPLY TO HIM‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚESPECIALLY IN USING THE WORD DESPAIR. YES, I AM REDUCED TO DESPAIR. NEVERTHELESS, NOTHING CAN TAKE THE PLACE OF THE SYSTEM SET FORTH IN MY BOOK, AND THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OUT OF IT; NO ONE CAN INVENT ANYTHING ELSE. AND SO I HASTEN WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME TO INVITE THE WHOLE SOCIETY TO LISTEN FOR TEN EVENINGS TO MY BOOK AND THEN GIVE THEIR OPINIONS OF IT. IF THE MEMBERS ARE UNWILLING TO LISTEN TO ME, LET US BREAK UP FROM THE START‚ÄÎTHE MEN TO TAKE UP SERVICE UNDER GOVERNMENT, THE WOMEN TO THEIR COOKING; FOR IF YOU REJECT MY SOLUTION YOU‚ÄÔLL FIND NO OTHER, NONE WHATEVER! IF THEY LET THE OPPORTUNITY SLIP, IT WILL SIMPLY BE THEIR LOSS, FOR THEY WILL BE BOUND TO COME BACK TO IT AGAIN.‚ÄÙ

THERE WAS A STIR IN THE COMPANY. ‚ÄÚIS HE MAD, OR WHAT?‚ÄÙ VOICES ASKED.

‚ÄÚSO THE WHOLE POINT LIES IN SHIGALOV‚ÄÔS DESPAIR,‚ÄÙ LYAMSHIN COMMENTED, ‚ÄÚAND THE ESSENTIAL QUESTION IS WHETHER HE MUST DESPAIR OR NOT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSHIGALOV‚ÄÔS BEING ON THE BRINK OF DESPAIR IS A PERSONAL QUESTION,‚ÄÙ DECLARED THE SCHOOLBOY.

‚ÄÚI PROPOSE WE PUT IT TO THE VOTE HOW FAR SHIGALOV‚ÄÔS DESPAIR AFFECTS THE COMMON CAUSE, AND AT THE SAME TIME WHETHER IT‚ÄÔS WORTH WHILE LISTENING TO HIM OR NOT,‚ÄÙ AN OFFICER SUGGESTED GAILY.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS NOT RIGHT.‚ÄÙ THE LAME TEACHER PUT IN HIS SPOKE AT LAST. AS A RULE HE SPOKE WITH A RATHER MOCKING SMILE, SO THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO MAKE OUT WHETHER HE WAS IN EARNEST OR JOKING. ‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS NOT RIGHT, GENTLEMEN. MR. SHIGALOV IS TOO MUCH DEVOTED TO HIS TASK AND IS ALSO TOO MODEST. I KNOW HIS BOOK. HE SUGGESTS AS A FINAL SOLUTION OF THE QUESTION THE DIVISION OF MANKIND INTO TWO UNEQUAL PARTS. ONE-TENTH ENJOYS ABSOLUTE LIBERTY AND UNBOUNDED POWER OVER THE OTHER NINE-TENTHS. THE OTHERS HAVE TO GIVE UP ALL INDIVIDUALITY AND BECOME, SO TO SPEAK, A HERD, AND, THROUGH BOUNDLESS SUBMISSION, WILL BY A SERIES OF REGENERATIONS ATTAIN PRIM√¶VAL INNOCENCE, SOMETHING LIKE THE GARDEN OF EDEN. THEY‚ÄÔLL HAVE TO WORK, HOWEVER. THE MEASURES PROPOSED BY THE AUTHOR FOR DEPRIVING NINE-TENTHS OF MANKIND OF THEIR FREEDOM AND TRANSFORMING THEM INTO A HERD THROUGH THE EDUCATION OF WHOLE GENERATIONS ARE VERY REMARKABLE, FOUNDED ON THE FACTS OF NATURE AND HIGHLY LOGICAL. ONE MAY NOT AGREE WITH SOME OF THE DEDUCTIONS, BUT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DOUBT THE INTELLIGENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE AUTHOR. IT‚ÄÔS A PITY THAT THE TIME REQUIRED‚ÄÎTEN EVENINGS‚ÄÎIS IMPOSSIBLE TO ARRANGE FOR, OR WE MIGHT HEAR A GREAT DEAL THAT‚ÄÔS INTERESTING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCAN YOU BE IN EARNEST?‚ÄÙ MADAME VIRGINSKY ADDRESSED THE LAME GENTLEMAN WITH A SHADE OF POSITIVE UNEASINESS IN HER VOICE, ‚ÄÚWHEN THAT MAN DOESN‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH PEOPLE AND SO TURNS NINE-TENTHS OF THEM INTO SLAVES? I‚ÄÔVE SUSPECTED HIM FOR A LONG TIME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU SAY THAT OF YOUR OWN BROTHER?‚ÄÙ ASKED THE LAME MAN.

‚ÄÚRELATIONSHIP? ARE YOU LAUGHING AT ME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND BESIDES, TO WORK FOR ARISTOCRATS AND TO OBEY THEM AS THOUGH THEY WERE GODS IS CONTEMPTIBLE!‚ÄÙ OBSERVED THE GIRL-STUDENT FIERCELY.

‚ÄÚWHAT I PROPOSE IS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE; IT‚ÄÔS PARADISE, AN EARTHLY PARADISE, AND THERE CAN BE NO OTHER ON EARTH,‚ÄÙ SHIGALOV PRONOUNCED AUTHORITATIVELY.

‚ÄÚFOR MY PART,‚ÄÙ SAID LYAMSHIN, ‚ÄÚIF I DIDN‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH NINE-TENTHS OF MANKIND, I‚ÄÔD TAKE THEM AND BLOW THEM UP INTO THE AIR INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM IN PARADISE. I‚ÄÔD ONLY LEAVE A HANDFUL OF EDUCATED PEOPLE, WHO WOULD LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTERWARDS ON SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO ONE BUT A BUFFOON CAN TALK LIKE THAT!‚ÄÙ CRIED THE GIRL, FLARING UP.

‚ÄÚHE IS A BUFFOON, BUT HE IS OF USE,‚ÄÙ MADAME VIRGINSKY WHISPERED TO HER.

‚ÄÚAND POSSIBLY THAT WOULD BE THE BEST SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM,‚ÄÙ SAID SHIGALOV, TURNING HOTLY TO LYAMSHIN. ‚ÄÚYOU CERTAINLY DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT A PROFOUND THING YOU‚ÄÔVE SUCCEEDED IN SAYING, MY MERRY FRIEND. BUT AS IT‚ÄÔS HARDLY POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT YOUR IDEA, WE MUST CONFINE OURSELVES TO AN EARTHLY PARADISE, SINCE THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT THEY CALL IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHIS IS PRETTY THOROUGH ROT,‚ÄÙ BROKE, AS THOUGH INVOLUNTARILY, FROM VERHOVENSKY. WITHOUT EVEN RAISING HIS EYES, HOWEVER, HE WENT ON CUTTING HIS NAILS WITH PERFECT NONCHALANCE.

‚ÄÚWHY IS IT ROT?‚ÄÙ THE LAME MAN TOOK IT UP INSTANTLY, AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN LYING IN WAIT FOR HIS FIRST WORDS TO CATCH AT THEM. ‚ÄÚWHY IS IT ROT? MR. SHIGALOV IS SOMEWHAT FANATICAL IN HIS LOVE FOR HUMANITY, BUT REMEMBER THAT FOURIER, STILL MORE CABET AND EVEN PROUDHON HIMSELF, ADVOCATED A NUMBER OF THE MOST DESPOTIC AND EVEN FANTASTIC MEASURES. MR. SHIGALOV IS PERHAPS FAR MORE SOBER IN HIS SUGGESTIONS THAN THEY ARE. I ASSURE YOU THAT WHEN ONE READS HIS BOOK IT‚ÄÔS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO AGREE WITH SOME THINGS. HE IS PERHAPS LESS FAR FROM REALISM THAN ANYONE AND HIS EARTHLY PARADISE IS ALMOST THE REAL ONE‚ÄÎIF IT EVER EXISTED‚ÄÎFOR THE LOSS OF WHICH MAN IS ALWAYS SIGHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNEW I WAS IN FOR SOMETHING,‚ÄÙ VERHOVENSKY MUTTERED AGAIN.

‚ÄÚALLOW ME,‚ÄÙ SAID THE LAME MAN, GETTING MORE AND MORE EXCITED. ‚ÄÚCONVERSATIONS AND ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE FUTURE ORGANISATION OF SOCIETY ARE ALMOST AN ACTUAL NECESSITY FOR ALL THINKING PEOPLE NOWADAYS. HERZEN WAS OCCUPIED WITH NOTHING ELSE ALL HIS LIFE. BYELINSKY, AS I KNOW ON VERY GOOD AUTHORITY, USED TO SPEND WHOLE EVENINGS WITH HIS FRIENDS DEBATING AND SETTLING BEFOREHAND EVEN THE MINUTEST, SO TO SPEAK, DOMESTIC, DETAILS OF THE SOCIAL ORGANISATION OF THE FUTURE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSOME PEOPLE GO CRAZY OVER IT,‚ÄÙ THE MAJOR OBSERVED SUDDENLY.

‚ÄÚWE ARE MORE LIKELY TO ARRIVE AT SOMETHING BY TALKING, ANYWAY, THAN BY SITTING SILENT AND POSING AS DICTATORS,‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN HISSED, AS THOUGH AT LAST VENTURING TO BEGIN THE ATTACK.

‚ÄÚI DIDN‚ÄÔT MEAN SHIGALOV WHEN I SAID IT WAS ROT,‚ÄÙ VERHOVENSKY MUMBLED. ‚ÄÚYOU SEE, GENTLEMEN,‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHE RAISED HIS EYES A TRIFLE‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚTO MY MIND ALL THESE BOOKS, FOURIER, CABET, ALL THIS TALK ABOUT THE RIGHT TO WORK, AND SHIGALOV‚ÄÔS THEORIES‚ÄÎARE ALL LIKE NOVELS OF WHICH ONE CAN WRITE A HUNDRED THOUSAND‚ÄÎAN √¶STHETIC ENTERTAINMENT. I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IN THIS LITTLE TOWN YOU ARE BORED, SO YOU RUSH TO INK AND PAPER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEXCUSE ME,‚ÄÙ SAID THE LAME MAN, WRIGGLING ON HIS CHAIR, ‚ÄÚTHOUGH WE ARE PROVINCIALS AND OF COURSE OBJECTS OF COMMISERATION ON THAT GROUND, YET WE KNOW THAT SO FAR NOTHING HAS HAPPENED IN THE WORLD NEW ENOUGH TO BE WORTH OUR WEEPING AT HAVING MISSED IT. IT IS SUGGESTED TO US IN VARIOUS PAMPHLETS MADE ABROAD AND SECRETLY DISTRIBUTED THAT WE SHOULD UNITE AND FORM GROUPS WITH THE SOLE OBJECT OF BRINGING ABOUT UNIVERSAL DESTRUCTION. IT‚ÄÔS URGED THAT, HOWEVER MUCH YOU TINKER WITH THE WORLD, YOU CAN‚ÄÔT MAKE A GOOD JOB OF IT, BUT THAT BY CUTTING OFF A HUNDRED MILLION HEADS AND SO LIGHTENING ONE‚ÄÔS BURDEN, ONE CAN JUMP OVER THE DITCH MORE SAFELY. A FINE IDEA, NO DOUBT, BUT QUITE AS IMPRACTICABLE AS SHIGALOV‚ÄÔS THEORIES, WHICH YOU REFERRED TO JUST NOW SO CONTEMPTUOUSLY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, BUT I HAVEN‚ÄÔT COME HERE FOR DISCUSSION.‚ÄÙ VERHOVENSKY LET DROP THIS SIGNIFICANT PHRASE, AND, AS THOUGH QUITE UNAWARE OF HIS BLUNDER, DREW THE CANDLE NEARER TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT SEE BETTER.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS A PITY, A GREAT PITY, THAT YOU HAVEN‚ÄÔT COME FOR DISCUSSION, AND IT‚ÄÔS A GREAT PITY THAT YOU ARE SO TAKEN UP JUST NOW WITH YOUR TOILET.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS MY TOILET TO YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO REMOVE A HUNDRED MILLION HEADS IS AS DIFFICULT AS TO TRANSFORM THE WORLD BY PROPAGANDA. POSSIBLY MORE DIFFICULT, ESPECIALLY IN RUSSIA,‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN VENTURED AGAIN.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS RUSSIA THEY REST THEIR HOPES ON NOW,‚ÄÙ SAID AN OFFICER.

‚ÄÚWE‚ÄÔVE HEARD THEY ARE RESTING THEIR HOPES ON IT,‚ÄÙ INTERPOSED THE LAME MAN. ‚ÄÚWE KNOW THAT A MYSTERIOUS FINGER IS POINTING TO OUR DELIGHTFUL COUNTRY AS THE LAND MOST FITTED TO ACCOMPLISH THE GREAT TASK. BUT THERE‚ÄÔS THIS: BY THE GRADUAL SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM BY PROPAGANDA I SHALL GAIN SOMETHING, ANYWAY‚ÄÎI SHALL HAVE SOME PLEASANT TALK, AT LEAST, AND SHALL EVEN GET SOME RECOGNITION FROM GOVERNMENT FOR MY SERVICES TO THE CAUSE OF SOCIETY. BUT IN THE SECOND WAY, BY THE RAPID METHOD OF CUTTING OFF A HUNDRED MILLION HEADS, WHAT BENEFIT SHALL I GET PERSONALLY? IF YOU BEGAN ADVOCATING THAT, YOUR TONGUE MIGHT BE CUT OUT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOURS CERTAINLY WOULD BE,‚ÄÙ OBSERVED VERHOVENSKY.

‚ÄÚYOU SEE. AND AS UNDER THE MOST FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU WOULD NOT GET THROUGH SUCH A MASSACRE IN LESS THAN FIFTY OR AT THE BEST THIRTY YEARS‚ÄÎFOR THEY ARE NOT SHEEP, YOU KNOW, AND PERHAPS THEY WOULD NOT LET THEMSELVES BE SLAUGHTERED‚ÄÎWOULDN‚ÄÔT IT BE BETTER TO PACK ONE‚ÄÔS BUNDLE AND MIGRATE TO SOME QUIET ISLAND BEYOND CALM SEAS AND THERE CLOSE ONE‚ÄÔS EYES TRANQUILLY? BELIEVE ME‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHE TAPPED THE TABLE SIGNIFICANTLY WITH HIS FINGER‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚYOU WILL ONLY PROMOTE EMIGRATION BY SUCH PROPAGANDA AND NOTHING ELSE!‚ÄÙ

HE FINISHED EVIDENTLY TRIUMPHANT. HE WAS ONE OF THE INTELLECTS OF THE PROVINCE. LIPUTIN SMILED SLYLY, VIRGINSKY LISTENED RATHER DEJECTEDLY, THE OTHERS FOLLOWED THE DISCUSSION WITH GREAT ATTENTION, ESPECIALLY THE LADIES AND OFFICERS. THEY ALL REALISED THAT THE ADVOCATE OF THE HUNDRED MILLION HEADS THEORY HAD BEEN DRIVEN INTO A CORNER, AND WAITED TO SEE WHAT WOULD COME OF IT.

‚ÄÚTHAT WAS A GOOD SAYING OF YOURS, THOUGH,‚ÄÙ VERHOVENSKY MUMBLED MORE CARELESSLY THAN EVER, IN FACT WITH AN AIR OF POSITIVE BOREDOM. ‚ÄÚEMIGRATION IS A GOOD IDEA. BUT ALL THE SAME, IF IN SPITE OF ALL THE OBVIOUS DISADVANTAGES YOU FORESEE, MORE AND MORE COME FORWARD EVERY DAY READY TO FIGHT FOR THE COMMON CAUSE, IT WILL BE ABLE TO DO WITHOUT YOU. IT‚ÄÔS A NEW RELIGION, MY GOOD FRIEND, COMING TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE OLD ONE. THAT‚ÄÔS WHY SO MANY FIGHTERS COME FORWARD, AND IT‚ÄÔS A BIG MOVEMENT. YOU‚ÄÔD BETTER EMIGRATE! AND, YOU KNOW, I SHOULD ADVISE DRESDEN, NOT ‚ÄÒTHE CALM ISLANDS.‚ÄÔ TO BEGIN WITH, IT‚ÄÔS A TOWN THAT HAS NEVER BEEN VISITED BY AN EPIDEMIC, AND AS YOU ARE A MAN OF CULTURE, NO DOUBT YOU ARE AFRAID OF DEATH. ANOTHER THING, IT‚ÄÔS NEAR THE RUSSIAN FRONTIER, SO YOU CAN MORE EASILY RECEIVE YOUR INCOME FROM YOUR BELOVED FATHERLAND. THIRDLY, IT CONTAINS WHAT ARE CALLED TREASURES OF ART, AND YOU ARE A MAN OF √¶STHETIC TASTES, FORMERLY A TEACHER OF LITERATURE, I BELIEVE. AND, FINALLY, IT HAS A MINIATURE SWITZERLAND OF ITS OWN‚ÄÎTO PROVIDE YOU WITH POETIC INSPIRATION, FOR NO DOUBT YOU WRITE VERSE. IN FACT IT‚ÄÔS A TREASURE IN A NUTSHELL!‚ÄÙ THERE WAS A GENERAL MOVEMENT, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE OFFICERS. IN ANOTHER INSTANT THEY WOULD HAVE ALL BEGUN TALKING AT ONCE. BUT THE LAME MAN ROSE IRRITABLY TO THE BAIT.

‚ÄÚNO, PERHAPS I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE UP THE COMMON CAUSE. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT, WOULD YOU JOIN THE QUINTET IF I PROPOSED IT TO YOU?‚ÄÙ VERHOVENSKY BOOMED SUDDENLY, AND HE LAID DOWN THE SCISSORS.

EVERY ONE SEEMED STARTLED. THE MYSTERIOUS MAN HAD REVEALED HIMSELF TOO FREELY. HE HAD EVEN SPOKEN OPENLY OF THE ‚ÄÚQUINTET.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEVERY ONE FEELS HIMSELF TO BE AN HONEST MAN AND WILL NOT SHIRK HIS PART IN THE COMMON CAUSE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHE LAME MAN TRIED TO WRIGGLE OUT OF IT‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚBUT ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, THIS IS NOT A QUESTION WHICH ALLOWS OF A BUT,‚ÄÙ VERHOVENSKY INTERRUPTED HARSHLY AND PEREMPTORILY. ‚ÄÚI TELL YOU, GENTLEMEN, I MUST HAVE A DIRECT ANSWER. I QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT, HAVING COME HERE AND HAVING CALLED YOU TOGETHER MYSELF, I AM BOUND TO GIVE YOU EXPLANATIONS‚ÄÙ (AGAIN AN UNEXPECTED REVELATION), ‚ÄÚBUT I CAN GIVE YOU NONE TILL I KNOW WHAT IS YOUR ATTITUDE TO THE SUBJECT. TO CUT THE MATTER SHORT‚ÄÎFOR WE CAN‚ÄÔT GO ON TALKING FOR ANOTHER THIRTY YEARS AS PEOPLE HAVE DONE FOR THE LAST THIRTY‚ÄÎI ASK YOU WHICH YOU PREFER: THE SLOW WAY, WHICH CONSISTS IN THE COMPOSITION OF SOCIALISTIC ROMANCES AND THE ACADEMIC ORDERING OF THE DESTINIES OF HUMANITY A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE, WHILE DESPOTISM WILL SWALLOW THE SAVOURY MORSELS WHICH WOULD ALMOST FLY INTO YOUR MOUTHS OF THEMSELVES IF YOU‚ÄÔD TAKE A LITTLE TROUBLE; OR DO YOU, WHATEVER IT MAY IMPLY, PREFER A QUICKER WAY WHICH WILL AT LAST UNTIE YOUR HANDS, AND WILL LET HUMANITY MAKE ITS OWN SOCIAL ORGANISATION IN FREEDOM AND IN ACTION, NOT ON PAPER? THEY SHOUT ‚ÄÒA HUNDRED MILLION HEADS‚ÄÔ; THAT MAY BE ONLY A METAPHOR; BUT WHY BE AFRAID OF IT IF, WITH THE SLOW DAY-DREAM ON PAPER, DESPOTISM IN THE COURSE OF SOME HUNDRED YEARS WILL DEVOUR NOT A HUNDRED BUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION HEADS? TAKE NOTE TOO THAT AN INCURABLE INVALID WILL NOT BE CURED WHATEVER PRESCRIPTIONS ARE WRITTEN FOR HIM ON PAPER. ON THE CONTRARY, IF THERE IS DELAY, HE WILL GROW SO CORRUPT THAT HE WILL INFECT US TOO AND CONTAMINATE ALL THE FRESH FORCES WHICH ONE MIGHT STILL RECKON UPON NOW, SO THAT WE SHALL ALL AT LAST COME TO GRIEF TOGETHER. I THOROUGHLY AGREE THAT IT‚ÄÔS EXTREMELY AGREEABLE TO CHATTER LIBERALLY AND ELOQUENTLY, BUT ACTION IS A LITTLE TRYING.‚Ä¶ HOWEVER, I AM NO HAND AT TALKING; I CAME HERE WITH COMMUNICATIONS, AND SO I BEG ALL THE HONOURABLE COMPANY NOT TO VOTE, BUT SIMPLY AND DIRECTLY TO STATE WHICH YOU PREFER: WALKING AT A SNAIL‚ÄÔS PACE IN THE MARSH, OR PUTTING ON FULL STEAM TO GET ACROSS IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM CERTAINLY FOR CROSSING AT FULL STEAM!‚ÄÙ CRIED THE SCHOOLBOY IN AN ECSTASY.

‚ÄÚSO AM I,‚ÄÙ LYAMSHIN CHIMED IN.

‚ÄÚTHERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THE CHOICE,‚ÄÙ MUTTERED AN OFFICER, FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER, THEN BY SOMEONE ELSE. WHAT STRUCK THEM ALL MOST WAS THAT VERHOVENSKY HAD COME ‚ÄÚWITH COMMUNICATIONS‚ÄÙ AND HAD HIMSELF JUST PROMISED TO SPEAK.

‚ÄÚGENTLEMEN, I SEE THAT ALMOST ALL DECIDE FOR THE POLICY OF THE MANIFESTOES,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, LOOKING ROUND AT THE COMPANY.

‚ÄÚALL, ALL!‚ÄÙ CRIED THE MAJORITY OF VOICES.

‚ÄÚI CONFESS I AM RATHER IN FAVOUR OF A MORE HUMANE POLICY,‚ÄÙ SAID THE MAJOR, ‚ÄÚBUT AS ALL ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE, I GO WITH ALL THE REST.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT APPEARS, THEN, THAT EVEN YOU ARE NOT OPPOSED TO IT,‚ÄÙ SAID VERHOVENSKY, ADDRESSING THE LAME MAN.

‚ÄÚI AM NOT EXACTLY ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ SAID THE LATTER, TURNING RATHER RED, ‚ÄÚBUT IF I DO AGREE WITH THE REST NOW, IT‚ÄÔS SIMPLY NOT TO BREAK UP‚ÄÎ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE ALL LIKE THAT! READY TO ARGUE FOR SIX MONTHS TO PRACTISE YOUR LIBERAL ELOQUENCE AND IN THE END YOU VOTE THE SAME AS THE REST! GENTLEMEN, CONSIDER THOUGH, IS IT TRUE THAT YOU ARE ALL READY?‚ÄÙ

(READY FOR WHAT? THE QUESTION WAS VAGUE, BUT VERY ALLURING.)

‚ÄÚALL ARE, OF COURSE!‚ÄÙ VOICES WERE HEARD. BUT ALL WERE LOOKING AT ONE ANOTHER.

‚ÄÚBUT AFTERWARDS PERHAPS YOU WILL RESENT HAVING AGREED SO QUICKLY? THAT‚ÄÔS ALMOST ALWAYS THE WAY WITH YOU.‚ÄÙ

THE COMPANY WAS EXCITED IN VARIOUS WAYS, GREATLY EXCITED. THE LAME MAN FLEW AT HIM.

‚ÄÚALLOW ME TO OBSERVE, HOWEVER, THAT ANSWERS TO SUCH QUESTIONS ARE CONDITIONAL. EVEN IF WE HAVE GIVEN OUR DECISION, YOU MUST NOTE THAT QUESTIONS PUT IN SUCH A STRANGE WAY ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIN WHAT STRANGE WAY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIN A WAY SUCH QUESTIONS ARE NOT ASKED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTEACH ME HOW, PLEASE. BUT DO YOU KNOW, I FELT SURE YOU‚ÄÔD BE THE FIRST TO TAKE OFFENCE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE EXTRACTED FROM US AN ANSWER AS TO OUR READINESS FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION; BUT WHAT RIGHT HAD YOU TO DO SO? BY WHAT AUTHORITY DO YOU ASK SUCH QUESTIONS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF ASKING THAT QUESTION SOONER! WHY DID YOU ANSWER? YOU AGREE AND THEN YOU GO BACK ON IT!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT TO MY MIND THE IRRESPONSIBILITY OF YOUR PRINCIPAL QUESTION SUGGESTS TO ME THAT YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY, NO RIGHT, AND ONLY ASKED FROM PERSONAL CURIOSITY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?‚ÄÙ CRIED VERHOVENSKY, APPARENTLY BEGINNING TO BE MUCH ALARMED.

‚ÄÚWHY, THAT THE INITIATION OF NEW MEMBERS INTO ANYTHING YOU LIKE IS DONE, ANYWAY, T√™TE-√†-T√™TE AND NOT IN THE COMPANY OF TWENTY PEOPLE ONE DOESN‚ÄÔT KNOW!‚ÄÙ BLURTED OUT THE LAME MAN. HE HAD SAID ALL THAT WAS IN HIS MIND BECAUSE HE WAS TOO IRRITATED TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF. VERHOVENSKY TURNED TO THE GENERAL COMPANY WITH A CAPITALLY SIMULATED LOOK OF ALARM.

‚ÄÚGENTLEMEN, I DEEM IT MY DUTY TO DECLARE THAT ALL THIS IS FOLLY, AND THAT OUR CONVERSATION HAS GONE TOO FAR. I HAVE SO FAR INITIATED NO ONE, AND NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO SAY OF ME THAT I INITIATE MEMBERS. WE WERE SIMPLY DISCUSSING OUR OPINIONS. THAT‚ÄÔS SO, ISN‚ÄÔT IT? BUT WHETHER THAT‚ÄÔS SO OR NOT, YOU ALARM ME VERY MUCH.‚ÄÙ HE TURNED TO THE LAME MAN AGAIN. ‚ÄÚI HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WAS UNSAFE HERE TO SPEAK OF SUCH PRACTICALLY INNOCENT MATTERS EXCEPT T√™TE-√†-T√™TE. ARE YOU AFRAID OF INFORMERS? CAN THERE POSSIBLY BE AN INFORMER AMONG US HERE?‚ÄÙ

THE EXCITEMENT BECAME TREMENDOUS; ALL BEGAN TALKING.

‚ÄÚGENTLEMEN, IF THAT IS SO,‚ÄÙ VERHOVENSKY WENT ON, ‚ÄÚI HAVE COMPROMISED MYSELF MORE THAN ANYONE, AND SO I WILL ASK YOU TO ANSWER ONE QUESTION, IF YOU CARE TO, OF COURSE. YOU ARE ALL PERFECTLY FREE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT QUESTION? WHAT QUESTION?‚ÄÙ EVERY ONE CLAMOURED.

‚ÄÚA QUESTION THAT WILL MAKE IT CLEAR WHETHER WE ARE TO REMAIN TOGETHER, OR TAKE UP OUR HATS AND GO OUR SEVERAL WAYS WITHOUT SPEAKING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE QUESTION! THE QUESTION!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF ANY ONE OF US KNEW OF A PROPOSED POLITICAL MURDER, WOULD HE, IN VIEW OF ALL THE CONSEQUENCES, GO TO GIVE INFORMATION, OR WOULD HE STAY AT HOME AND AWAIT EVENTS? OPINIONS MAY DIFFER ON THIS POINT. THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WILL TELL US CLEARLY WHETHER WE ARE TO SEPARATE, OR TO REMAIN TOGETHER AND FOR FAR LONGER THAN THIS ONE EVENING. LET ME APPEAL TO YOU FIRST.‚ÄÙ HE TURNED TO THE LAME MAN.

‚ÄÚWHY TO ME FIRST?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBECAUSE YOU BEGAN IT ALL. BE SO GOOD AS NOT TO PREVARICATE; IT WON‚ÄÔT HELP YOU TO BE CUNNING. BUT PLEASE YOURSELF, IT‚ÄÔS FOR YOU TO DECIDE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEXCUSE ME, BUT SUCH A QUESTION IS POSITIVELY INSULTING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, CAN‚ÄÔT YOU BE MORE EXACT THAN THAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE NEVER BEEN AN AGENT OF THE SECRET POLICE,‚ÄÙ REPLIED THE LATTER, WRIGGLING MORE THAN EVER.

‚ÄÚBE SO GOOD AS TO BE MORE DEFINITE, DON‚ÄÔT KEEP US WAITING.‚ÄÙ

THE LAME MAN WAS SO FURIOUS THAT HE LEFT OFF ANSWERING. WITHOUT A WORD HE GLARED WRATHFULLY FROM UNDER HIS SPECTACLES AT HIS TORMENTOR.

‚ÄÚYES OR NO? WOULD YOU INFORM OR NOT?‚ÄÙ CRIED VERHOVENSKY.

‚ÄÚOF COURSE I WOULDN‚ÄÔT,‚ÄÙ THE LAME MAN SHOUTED TWICE AS LOUDLY.

‚ÄÚAND NO ONE WOULD, OF COURSE NOT!‚ÄÙ CRIED MANY VOICES.

‚ÄÚALLOW ME TO APPEAL TO YOU, MR. MAJOR. WOULD YOU INFORM OR NOT?‚ÄÙ VERHOVENSKY WENT ON. ‚ÄÚAND NOTE THAT I APPEAL TO YOU ON PURPOSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WON‚ÄÔT INFORM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT IF YOU KNEW THAT SOMEONE MEANT TO ROB AND MURDER SOMEONE ELSE, AN ORDINARY MORTAL, THEN YOU WOULD INFORM AND GIVE WARNING?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, OF COURSE; BUT THAT‚ÄÔS A PRIVATE AFFAIR, WHILE THE OTHER WOULD BE A POLITICAL TREACHERY. I‚ÄÔVE NEVER BEEN AN AGENT OF THE SECRET POLICE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND NO ONE HERE HAS,‚ÄÙ VOICES CRIED AGAIN. ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS AN UNNECESSARY QUESTION. EVERY ONE WILL MAKE THE SAME ANSWER. THERE ARE NO INFORMERS HERE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT IS THAT GENTLEMAN GETTING UP FOR?‚ÄÙ CRIED THE GIRL-STUDENT.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS SHATOV. WHAT ARE YOU GETTING UP FOR?‚ÄÙ CRIED THE LADY OF THE HOUSE.

SHATOV DID, IN FACT, STAND UP. HE WAS HOLDING HIS CAP IN HIS HAND AND LOOKING AT VERHOVENSKY. APPARENTLY HE WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING TO HIM, BUT WAS HESITATING. HIS FACE WAS PALE AND WRATHFUL, BUT HE CONTROLLED HIMSELF. HE DID NOT SAY ONE WORD, BUT IN SILENCE WALKED TOWARDS THE DOOR.

‚ÄÚSHATOV, THIS WON‚ÄÔT MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR YOU!‚ÄÙ VERHOVENSKY CALLED AFTER HIM ENIGMATICALLY.

‚ÄÚBUT IT WILL FOR YOU, SINCE YOU ARE A SPY AND A SCOUNDREL!‚ÄÙ SHATOV SHOUTED TO HIM FROM THE DOOR, AND HE WENT OUT.

SHOUTS AND EXCLAMATIONS AGAIN.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS WHAT COMES OF A TEST,‚ÄÙ CRIED A VOICE.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS BEEN OF USE,‚ÄÙ CRIED ANOTHER.

‚ÄÚHASN‚ÄÔT IT BEEN OF USE TOO LATE?‚ÄÙ OBSERVED A THIRD.

‚ÄÚWHO INVITED HIM? WHO LET HIM IN? WHO IS HE? WHO IS SHATOV? WILL HE INFORM, OR WON‚ÄÔT HE?‚ÄÙ THERE WAS A SHOWER OF QUESTIONS.

‚ÄÚIF HE WERE AN INFORMER HE WOULD HAVE KEPT UP APPEARANCES INSTEAD OF CURSING IT ALL AND GOING AWAY,‚ÄÙ OBSERVED SOMEONE.

‚ÄÚSEE, STAVROGIN IS GETTING UP TOO. STAVROGIN HAS NOT ANSWERED THE QUESTION EITHER,‚ÄÙ CRIED THE GIRL-STUDENT.

STAVROGIN DID ACTUALLY STAND UP, AND AT THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE KIRILLOV ROSE AT THE SAME TIME.

‚ÄÚEXCUSE ME, MR. STAVROGIN,‚ÄÙ MADAME VIRGINSKY ADDRESSED HIM SHARPLY, ‚ÄÚWE ALL ANSWERED THE QUESTION, WHILE YOU ARE GOING AWAY WITHOUT A WORD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SEE NO NECESSITY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHICH INTERESTS YOU,‚ÄÙ MUTTERED STAVROGIN.

‚ÄÚBUT WE‚ÄÔVE COMPROMISED OURSELVES AND YOU WON‚ÄÔT,‚ÄÙ SHOUTED SEVERAL VOICES.

‚ÄÚWHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF MINE IF YOU HAVE COMPROMISED YOURSELVES?‚ÄÙ LAUGHED STAVROGIN, BUT HIS EYES FLASHED.

‚ÄÚWHAT BUSINESS? WHAT BUSINESS?‚ÄÙ VOICES EXCLAIMED.

MANY PEOPLE GOT UP FROM THEIR CHAIRS.

‚ÄÚALLOW ME, GENTLEMEN, ALLOW ME,‚ÄÙ CRIED THE LAME MAN. ‚ÄÚMR. VERHOVENSKY HASN‚ÄÔT ANSWERED THE QUESTION EITHER; HE HAS ONLY ASKED IT.‚ÄÙ

THE REMARK PRODUCED A STRIKING EFFECT. ALL LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER. STAVROGIN LAUGHED ALOUD IN THE LAME MAN‚ÄÔS FACE AND WENT OUT; KIRILLOV FOLLOWED HIM; VERHOVENSKY RAN AFTER THEM INTO THE PASSAGE.

‚ÄÚWHAT ARE YOU DOING?‚ÄÙ HE FALTERED, SEIZING STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS HAND AND GRIPPING IT WITH ALL HIS MIGHT IN HIS. STAVROGIN PULLED AWAY HIS HAND WITHOUT A WORD.

‚ÄÚBE AT KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS DIRECTLY, I‚ÄÔLL COME.‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR ME TO SEE YOU!‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT ISN‚ÄÔT NECESSARY FOR ME,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN CUT HIM SHORT.

‚ÄÚSTAVROGIN WILL BE THERE,‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV SAID FINALLY. ‚ÄÚSTAVROGIN, IT IS NECESSARY FOR YOU. I WILL SHOW YOU THAT THERE.‚ÄÙ

THEY WENT OUT.





CHAPTER VIII. IVAN THE TSAREVITCH

THEY HAD GONE. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS ABOUT TO RUSH BACK TO THE MEETING TO BRING ORDER INTO CHAOS, BUT PROBABLY REFLECTING THAT IT WASN‚ÄÔT WORTH BOTHERING ABOUT, LEFT EVERYTHING, AND TWO MINUTES LATER WAS FLYING AFTER THE OTHER TWO. ON THE WAY HE REMEMBERED A SHORT CUT TO FILIPOV‚ÄÔS HOUSE. HE RUSHED ALONG IT, UP TO HIS KNEES IN MUD, AND DID IN FACT ARRIVE AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN STAVROGIN AND KIRILLOV WERE COMING IN AT THE GATE.

‚ÄÚYOU HERE ALREADY?‚ÄÙ OBSERVED KIRILLOV. ‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS GOOD. COME IN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW IS IT YOU TOLD US YOU LIVED ALONE,‚ÄÙ ASKED STAVROGIN, PASSING A BOILING SAMOVAR IN THE PASSAGE.

‚ÄÚYOU WILL SEE DIRECTLY WHO IT IS I LIVE WITH,‚ÄÙ MUTTERED KIRILLOV. ‚ÄÚGO IN.‚ÄÙ

THEY HAD HARDLY ENTERED WHEN VERHOVENSKY AT ONCE TOOK OUT OF HIS POCKET THE ANONYMOUS LETTER HE HAD TAKEN FROM LEMBKE, AND LAID IT BEFORE STAVROGIN. THEY ALL THEN SAT DOWN. STAVROGIN READ THE LETTER IN SILENCE.

‚ÄÚWELL?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED.

‚ÄÚTHAT SCOUNDREL WILL DO AS HE WRITES,‚ÄÙ VERHOVENSKY EXPLAINED. ‚ÄÚSO, AS HE IS UNDER YOUR CONTROL, TELL ME HOW TO ACT. I ASSURE YOU HE MAY GO TO LEMBKE TO-MORROW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, LET HIM GO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLET HIM GO! AND WHEN WE CAN PREVENT HIM, TOO!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE MISTAKEN. HE IS NOT DEPENDENT ON ME. BESIDES, I DON‚ÄÔT CARE; HE DOESN‚ÄÔT THREATEN ME IN ANY WAY; HE ONLY THREATENS YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU TOO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT THINK SO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT SPARE YOU. SURELY YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? LISTEN, STAVROGIN. THIS IS ONLY PLAYING WITH WORDS. SURELY YOU DON‚ÄÔT GRUDGE THE MONEY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, WOULD IT COST MONEY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT CERTAINLY WOULD; TWO THOUSAND OR AT LEAST FIFTEEN HUNDRED. GIVE IT TO ME TO-MORROW OR EVEN TO-DAY, AND TO-MORROW EVENING I‚ÄÔLL SEND HIM TO PETERSBURG FOR YOU. THAT‚ÄÔS JUST WHAT HE WANTS. IF YOU LIKE, HE CAN TAKE MARYA TIMOFYEVNA. NOTE THAT.‚ÄÙ

THERE WAS SOMETHING DISTRACTED ABOUT HIM. HE SPOKE, AS IT WERE, WITHOUT CAUTION, AND HE DID NOT REFLECT ON HIS WORDS. STAVROGIN WATCHED HIM, WONDERING.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE NO REASON TO SEND MARYA TIMOFYEVNA AWAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPERHAPS YOU DON‚ÄÔT EVEN WANT TO,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SMILED IRONICALLY.

‚ÄÚPERHAPS I DON‚ÄÔT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIN SHORT, WILL THERE BE THE MONEY OR NOT?‚ÄÙ HE CRIED WITH ANGRY IMPATIENCE, AND AS IT WERE PEREMPTORILY, TO STAVROGIN. THE LATTER SCRUTINISED HIM GRAVELY. ‚ÄÚTHERE WON‚ÄÔT BE THE MONEY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLOOK HERE, STAVROGIN! YOU KNOW SOMETHING, OR HAVE DONE SOMETHING ALREADY! YOU ARE GOING IT!‚ÄÙ

HIS FACE WORKED, THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH TWITCHED, AND HE SUDDENLY LAUGHED AN UNPROVOKED AND IRRELEVANT LAUGH.

‚ÄÚBUT YOU‚ÄÔVE HAD MONEY FROM YOUR FATHER FOR THE ESTATE,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN OBSERVED CALMLY. ‚ÄÚMAMAN SENT YOU SIX OR EIGHT THOUSAND FOR STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. SO YOU CAN PAY THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED OUT OF YOUR OWN MONEY. I DON‚ÄÔT CARE TO PAY FOR OTHER PEOPLE. I‚ÄÔVE GIVEN A LOT AS IT IS. IT ANNOYS ME.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HE SMILED HIMSELF AT HIS OWN WORDS.

‚ÄÚAH, YOU ARE BEGINNING TO JOKE!‚ÄÙ

STAVROGIN GOT UP FROM HIS CHAIR. VERHOVENSKY INSTANTLY JUMPED UP TOO, AND MECHANICALLY STOOD WITH HIS BACK TO THE DOOR AS THOUGH BARRING THE WAY TO HIM. STAVROGIN HAD ALREADY MADE A MOTION TO PUSH HIM ASIDE AND GO OUT, WHEN HE STOPPED SHORT.

‚ÄÚI WON‚ÄÔT GIVE UP SHATOV TO YOU,‚ÄÙ HE SAID. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH STARTED. THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER.

‚ÄÚI TOLD YOU THIS EVENING WHY YOU NEEDED SHATOV‚ÄÔS BLOOD,‚ÄÙ SAID STAVROGIN, WITH FLASHING EYES. ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS THE CEMENT YOU WANT TO BIND YOUR GROUPS TOGETHER WITH. YOU DROVE SHATOV AWAY CLEVERLY JUST NOW. YOU KNEW VERY WELL THAT HE WOULDN‚ÄÔT PROMISE NOT TO INFORM AND HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT MEAN TO LIE TO YOU. BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME? WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME? EVER SINCE WE MET ABROAD YOU WON‚ÄÔT LET ME ALONE. THE EXPLANATION YOU‚ÄÔVE GIVEN ME SO FAR WAS SIMPLY RAVING. MEANWHILE YOU ARE DRIVING AT MY GIVING LEBYADKIN FIFTEEN HUNDRED ROUBLES, SO AS TO GIVE FEDKA AN OPPORTUNITY TO MURDER HIM. I KNOW THAT YOU THINK I WANT MY WIFE MURDERED TOO. YOU THINK TO TIE MY HANDS BY THIS CRIME, AND HAVE ME IN YOUR POWER. THAT‚ÄÔS IT, ISN‚ÄÔT IT? WHAT GOOD WILL THAT BE TO YOU? WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU WANT WITH ME? LOOK AT ME. ONCE FOR ALL, AM I THE MAN FOR YOU? AND LET ME ALONE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHAS FEDKA BEEN TO YOU HIMSELF?‚ÄÙ VERHOVENSKY ASKED BREATHLESSLY.

‚ÄÚYES, HE CAME. HIS PRICE IS FIFTEEN HUNDRED TOO.‚Ä¶ BUT HERE; HE‚ÄÔLL REPEAT IT HIMSELF. THERE HE STANDS.‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND.

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH TURNED ROUND QUICKLY. A NEW FIGURE, FEDKA, WEARING A SHEEP-SKIN COAT, BUT WITHOUT A CAP, AS THOUGH HE WERE AT HOME, STEPPED OUT OF THE DARKNESS IN THE DOORWAY. HE STOOD THERE LAUGHING AND SHOWING HIS EVEN WHITE TEETH. HIS BLACK EYES, WITH YELLOW WHITES, DARTED CAUTIOUSLY ABOUT THE ROOM WATCHING THE GENTLEMEN. THERE WAS SOMETHING HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND. HE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN JUST BROUGHT IN BY KIRILLOV, AND HIS INQUIRING EYES TURNED TO THE LATTER. HE STOOD IN THE DOORWAY, BUT WAS UNWILLING TO COME INTO THE ROOM.

‚ÄÚI SUPPOSE YOU GOT HIM READY HERE TO LISTEN TO OUR BARGAINING, OR THAT HE MAY ACTUALLY SEE THE MONEY IN OUR HANDS. IS THAT IT?‚ÄÙ ASKED STAVROGIN; AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER HE WALKED OUT OF THE HOUSE. VERHOVENSKY, ALMOST FRANTIC, OVERTOOK HIM AT THE GATE.

‚ÄÚSTOP! NOT ANOTHER STEP!‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, SEIZING HIM BY THE ARM. STAVROGIN TRIED TO PULL AWAY HIS ARM, BUT DID NOT SUCCEED. HE WAS OVERCOME WITH FURY. SEIZING VERHOVENSKY BY THE HAIR WITH HIS LEFT HAND HE FLUNG HIM WITH ALL HIS MIGHT ON THE GROUND AND WENT OUT AT THE GATE. BUT HE HAD NOT GONE THIRTY PACES BEFORE VERHOVENSKY OVERTOOK HIM AGAIN.

‚ÄÚLET US MAKE IT UP; LET US MAKE IT UP!‚ÄÙ HE MURMURED IN A SPASMODIC WHISPER.

STAVROGIN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS, BUT NEITHER ANSWERED NOR TURNED ROUND.

‚ÄÚLISTEN. I WILL BRING YOU LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA TO-MORROW; SHALL I? NO? WHY DON‚ÄÔT YOU ANSWER? TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT. I‚ÄÔLL DO IT. LISTEN. I‚ÄÔLL LET YOU HAVE SHATOV. SHALL I?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEN IT‚ÄÔS TRUE THAT YOU MEANT TO KILL HIM?‚ÄÙ CRIED STAVROGIN.

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU WANT WITH SHATOV? WHAT IS HE TO YOU?‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WENT ON, GASPING, SPEAKING RAPIDLY. HE WAS IN A FRENZY, AND KEPT RUNNING FORWARD AND SEIZING STAVROGIN BY THE ELBOW, PROBABLY UNAWARE OF WHAT HE WAS DOING. ‚ÄÚLISTEN. I‚ÄÔLL LET YOU HAVE HIM. LET‚ÄÔS MAKE IT UP. YOUR PRICE IS A VERY GREAT ONE, BUT ‚Ä¶ LET‚ÄÔS MAKE IT UP!‚ÄÙ

STAVROGIN GLANCED AT HIM AT LAST, AND WAS AMAZED. THE EYES, THE VOICE, WERE NOT THE SAME AS ALWAYS, OR AS THEY HAD BEEN IN THE ROOM JUST NOW. WHAT HE SAW WAS ALMOST ANOTHER FACE. THE INTONATION OF THE VOICE WAS DIFFERENT. VERHOVENSKY BESOUGHT, IMPLORED. HE WAS A MAN FROM WHOM WHAT WAS MOST PRECIOUS WAS BEING TAKEN OR HAD BEEN TAKEN, AND WHO WAS STILL STUNNED BY THE SHOCK.

‚ÄÚBUT WHAT‚ÄÔS THE MATTER WITH YOU?‚ÄÙ CRIED STAVROGIN. THE OTHER DID NOT ANSWER, BUT RAN AFTER HIM AND GAZED AT HIM WITH THE SAME IMPLORING BUT YET INFLEXIBLE EXPRESSION.

‚ÄÚLET‚ÄÔS MAKE IT UP!‚ÄÙ HE WHISPERED ONCE MORE. ‚ÄÚLISTEN. LIKE FEDKA, I HAVE A KNIFE IN MY BOOT, BUT I‚ÄÔLL MAKE IT UP WITH YOU!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME, DAMN YOU?‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN CRIED, WITH INTENSE ANGER AND AMAZEMENT. ‚ÄÚIS THERE SOME MYSTERY ABOUT IT? AM I A SORT OF TALISMAN FOR YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLISTEN. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A REVOLUTION,‚ÄÙ THE OTHER MUTTERED RAPIDLY, AND ALMOST IN DELIRIUM. ‚ÄÚYOU DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE WE SHALL MAKE A REVOLUTION? WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SUCH AN UPHEAVAL THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE UPROOTED FROM ITS FOUNDATION. KARMAZINOV IS RIGHT THAT THERE IS NOTHING TO LAY HOLD OF. KARMAZINOV IS VERY INTELLIGENT. ANOTHER TEN SUCH GROUPS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF RUSSIA‚ÄÎAND I AM SAFE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGROUPS OF FOOLS LIKE THAT?‚ÄÙ BROKE RELUCTANTLY FROM STAVROGIN.

‚ÄÚOH, DON‚ÄÔT BE SO CLEVER, STAVROGIN; DON‚ÄÔT BE SO CLEVER YOURSELF. AND YOU KNOW YOU ARE BY NO MEANS SO INTELLIGENT THAT YOU NEED WISH OTHERS TO BE. YOU ARE AFRAID, YOU HAVE NO FAITH. YOU ARE FRIGHTENED AT OUR DOING THINGS ON SUCH A SCALE. AND WHY ARE THEY FOOLS? THEY ARE NOT SUCH FOOLS. NO ONE HAS A MIND OF HIS OWN NOWADAYS. THERE ARE TERRIBLY FEW ORIGINAL MINDS NOWADAYS. VIRGINSKY IS A PURE-HEARTED MAN, TEN TIMES AS PURE AS YOU OR I; BUT NEVER MIND ABOUT HIM. LIPUTIN IS A ROGUE, BUT I KNOW ONE POINT ABOUT HIM. EVERY ROGUE HAS SOME POINT IN HIM.‚Ä¶ LYAMSHIN IS THE ONLY ONE WHO HASN‚ÄÔT, BUT HE IS IN MY HANDS. A FEW MORE GROUPS, AND I SHOULD HAVE MONEY AND PASSPORTS EVERYWHERE; SO MUCH AT LEAST. SUPPOSE IT WERE ONLY THAT? AND SAFE PLACES, SO THAT THEY CAN SEARCH AS THEY LIKE. THEY MIGHT UPROOT ONE GROUP BUT THEY‚ÄÔD STICK AT THE NEXT. WE‚ÄÔLL SET THINGS IN A FERMENT.‚Ä¶ SURELY YOU DON‚ÄÔT THINK THAT WE TWO ARE NOT ENOUGH?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTAKE SHIGALOV, AND LET ME ALONE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSHIGALOV IS A MAN OF GENIUS! DO YOU KNOW HE IS A GENIUS LIKE FOURIER, BUT BOLDER THAN FOURIER; STRONGER. I‚ÄÔLL LOOK AFTER HIM. HE‚ÄÔS DISCOVERED ‚ÄÒEQUALITY‚ÄÔ!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE IS IN A FEVER; HE IS RAVING; SOMETHING VERY QUEER HAS HAPPENED TO HIM,‚ÄÙ THOUGHT STAVROGIN, LOOKING AT HIM ONCE MORE. BOTH WALKED ON WITHOUT STOPPING.

‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS WRITTEN A GOOD THING IN THAT MANUSCRIPT,‚ÄÙ VERHOVENSKY WENT ON. ‚ÄÚHE SUGGESTS A SYSTEM OF SPYING. EVERY MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY SPIES ON THE OTHERS, AND IT‚ÄÔS HIS DUTY TO INFORM AGAINST THEM. EVERY ONE BELONGS TO ALL AND ALL TO EVERY ONE. ALL ARE SLAVES AND EQUAL IN THEIR SLAVERY. IN EXTREME CASES HE ADVOCATES SLANDER AND MURDER, BUT THE GREAT THING ABOUT IT IS EQUALITY. TO BEGIN WITH, THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION, SCIENCE, AND TALENTS IS LOWERED. A HIGH LEVEL OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE IS ONLY POSSIBLE FOR GREAT INTELLECTS, AND THEY ARE NOT WANTED. THE GREAT INTELLECTS HAVE ALWAYS SEIZED THE POWER AND BEEN DESPOTS. GREAT INTELLECTS CANNOT HELP BEING DESPOTS AND THEY‚ÄÔVE ALWAYS DONE MORE HARM THAN GOOD. THEY WILL BE BANISHED OR PUT TO DEATH. CICERO WILL HAVE HIS TONGUE CUT OUT, COPERNICUS WILL HAVE HIS EYES PUT OUT, SHAKESPEARE WILL BE STONED‚ÄÎTHAT‚ÄÔS SHIGALOVISM. SLAVES ARE BOUND TO BE EQUAL. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN EITHER FREEDOM OR EQUALITY WITHOUT DESPOTISM, BUT IN THE HERD THERE IS BOUND TO BE EQUALITY, AND THAT‚ÄÔS SHIGALOVISM! HA HA HA! DO YOU THINK IT STRANGE? I AM FOR SHIGALOVISM.‚ÄÙ

STAVROGIN TRIED TO QUICKEN HIS PACE, AND TO REACH HOME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ‚ÄÚIF THIS FELLOW IS DRUNK, WHERE DID HE MANAGE TO GET DRUNK?‚ÄÙ CROSSED HIS MIND. ‚ÄÚCAN IT BE THE BRANDY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLISTEN, STAVROGIN. TO LEVEL THE MOUNTAINS IS A FINE IDEA, NOT AN ABSURD ONE. I AM FOR SHIGALOV. DOWN WITH CULTURE. WE‚ÄÔVE HAD ENOUGH SCIENCE! WITHOUT SCIENCE WE HAVE MATERIAL ENOUGH TO GO ON FOR A THOUSAND YEARS, BUT ONE MUST HAVE DISCIPLINE. THE ONE THING WANTING IN THE WORLD IS DISCIPLINE. THE THIRST FOR CULTURE IS AN ARISTOCRATIC THIRST. THE MOMENT YOU HAVE FAMILY TIES OR LOVE YOU GET THE DESIRE FOR PROPERTY. WE WILL DESTROY THAT DESIRE; WE‚ÄÔLL MAKE USE OF DRUNKENNESS, SLANDER, SPYING; WE‚ÄÔLL MAKE USE OF INCREDIBLE CORRUPTION; WE‚ÄÔLL STIFLE EVERY GENIUS IN ITS INFANCY. WE‚ÄÔLL REDUCE ALL TO A COMMON DENOMINATOR! COMPLETE EQUALITY! ‚ÄÒWE‚ÄÔVE LEARNED A TRADE, AND WE ARE HONEST MEN; WE NEED NOTHING MORE,‚ÄÔ THAT WAS AN ANSWER GIVEN BY ENGLISH WORKING-MEN RECENTLY. ONLY THE NECESSARY IS NECESSARY, THAT‚ÄÔS THE MOTTO OF THE WHOLE WORLD HENCEFORWARD. BUT IT NEEDS A SHOCK. THAT‚ÄÔS FOR US, THE DIRECTORS, TO LOOK AFTER. SLAVES MUST HAVE DIRECTORS. ABSOLUTE SUBMISSION, ABSOLUTE LOSS OF INDIVIDUALITY, BUT ONCE IN THIRTY YEARS SHIGALOV WOULD LET THEM HAVE A SHOCK AND THEY WOULD ALL SUDDENLY BEGIN EATING ONE ANOTHER UP, TO A CERTAIN POINT, SIMPLY AS A PRECAUTION AGAINST BOREDOM. BOREDOM IS AN ARISTOCRATIC SENSATION. THE SHIGALOVIANS WILL HAVE NO DESIRES. DESIRE AND SUFFERING ARE OUR LOT, BUT SHIGALOVISM IS FOR THE SLAVES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU EXCLUDE YOURSELF?‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN BROKE IN AGAIN.

‚ÄÚYOU, TOO. DO YOU KNOW, I HAVE THOUGHT OF GIVING UP THE WORLD TO THE POPE. LET HIM COME FORTH, ON FOOT, AND BAREFOOT, AND SHOW HIMSELF TO THE RABBLE, SAYING, ‚ÄÒSEE WHAT THEY HAVE BROUGHT ME TO!‚ÄÔ AND THEY WILL ALL RUSH AFTER HIM, EVEN THE TROOPS. THE POPE AT THE HEAD, WITH US ROUND HIM, AND BELOW US‚ÄÎSHIGALOVISM. ALL THAT‚ÄÔS NEEDED IS THAT THE INTERNATIONALE SHOULD COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE POPE; SO IT WILL. AND THE OLD CHAP WILL AGREE AT ONCE. THERE‚ÄÔS NOTHING ELSE HE CAN DO. REMEMBER MY WORDS! HA HA! IS IT STUPID? TELL ME, IS IT STUPID OR NOT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH!‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN MUTTERED WITH VEXATION.

‚ÄÚENOUGH! LISTEN. I‚ÄÔVE GIVEN UP THE POPE! DAMN SHIGALOVISM! DAMN THE POPE! WE MUST HAVE SOMETHING MORE EVERYDAY. NOT SHIGALOVISM, FOR SHIGALOVISM IS A RARE SPECIMEN OF THE JEWELLER‚ÄÔS ART. IT‚ÄÔS AN IDEAL; IT‚ÄÔS IN THE FUTURE. SHIGALOV IS AN ARTIST AND A FOOL LIKE EVERY PHILANTHROPIST. WE NEED COARSE WORK, AND SHIGALOV DESPISES COARSE WORK. LISTEN. THE POPE SHALL BE FOR THE WEST, AND YOU SHALL BE FOR US, YOU SHALL BE FOR US!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLET ME ALONE, YOU DRUNKEN FELLOW!‚ÄÙ MUTTERED STAVROGIN, AND HE QUICKENED HIS PACE.

‚ÄÚSTAVROGIN, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL,‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, ALMOST ECSTATICALLY. ‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL! WHAT‚ÄÔS THE MOST PRECIOUS THING ABOUT YOU IS THAT YOU SOMETIMES DON‚ÄÔT KNOW IT. OH, I‚ÄÔVE STUDIED YOU! I OFTEN WATCH YOU ON THE SLY! THERE‚ÄÔS A LOT OF SIMPLEHEARTEDNESS AND NA√ØVET√© ABOUT YOU STILL. DO YOU KNOW THAT? THERE STILL IS, THERE IS! YOU MUST BE SUFFERING AND SUFFERING GENUINELY FROM THAT SIMPLE-HEARTEDNESS. I LOVE BEAUTY. I AM A NIHILIST, BUT I LOVE BEAUTY. ARE NIHILISTS INCAPABLE OF LOVING BEAUTY? IT‚ÄÔS ONLY IDOLS THEY DISLIKE, BUT I LOVE AN IDOL. YOU ARE MY IDOL! YOU INJURE NO ONE, AND EVERY ONE HATES YOU. YOU TREAT EVERY ONE AS AN EQUAL, AND YET EVERY ONE IS AFRAID OF YOU‚ÄÎTHAT‚ÄÔS GOOD. NOBODY WOULD SLAP YOU ON THE SHOULDER. YOU ARE AN AWFUL ARISTOCRAT. AN ARISTOCRAT IS IRRESISTIBLE WHEN HE GOES IN FOR DEMOCRACY! TO SACRIFICE LIFE, YOUR OWN OR ANOTHER‚ÄÔS IS NOTHING TO YOU. YOU ARE JUST THE MAN THAT‚ÄÔS NEEDED. IT‚ÄÔS JUST SUCH A MAN AS YOU THAT I NEED. I KNOW NO ONE BUT YOU. YOU ARE THE LEADER, YOU ARE THE SUN AND I AM YOUR WORM.‚ÄÙ

HE SUDDENLY KISSED HIS HAND. A SHIVER RAN DOWN STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS SPINE, AND HE PULLED AWAY HIS HAND IN DISMAY. THEY STOOD STILL.

‚ÄÚMADMAN!‚ÄÙ WHISPERED STAVROGIN.

‚ÄÚPERHAPS I AM RAVING; PERHAPS I AM RAVING,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH ASSENTED, SPEAKING RAPIDLY. ‚ÄÚBUT I‚ÄÔVE THOUGHT OF THE FIRST STEP! SHIGALOV WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF IT. THERE ARE LOTS OF SHIGALOVS, BUT ONLY ONE MAN, ONE MAN IN RUSSIA HAS HIT ON THE FIRST STEP AND KNOWS HOW TO TAKE IT. AND I AM THAT MAN! WHY DO YOU LOOK AT ME? I NEED YOU, YOU; WITHOUT YOU I AM NOTHING. WITHOUT YOU I AM A FLY, A BOTTLED IDEA; COLUMBUS WITHOUT AMERICA.‚ÄÙ

STAVROGIN STOOD STILL AND LOOKED INTENTLY INTO HIS WILD EYES.

‚ÄÚLISTEN. FIRST OF ALL WE‚ÄÔLL MAKE AN UPHEAVAL,‚ÄÙ VERHOVENSKY WENT ON IN DESPERATE HASTE, CONTINUALLY CLUTCHING AT STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS LEFT SLEEVE. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE ALREADY TOLD YOU. WE SHALL PENETRATE TO THE PEASANTRY. DO YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE TREMENDOUSLY POWERFUL ALREADY? OUR PARTY DOES NOT CONSIST ONLY OF THOSE WHO COMMIT MURDER AND ARSON, FIRE OFF PISTOLS IN THE TRADITIONAL FASHION, OR BITE COLONELS. THEY ARE ONLY A HINDRANCE. I DON‚ÄÔT ACCEPT ANYTHING WITHOUT DISCIPLINE. I AM A SCOUNDREL, OF COURSE, AND NOT A SOCIALIST. HA HA! LISTEN. I‚ÄÔVE RECKONED THEM ALL UP: A TEACHER WHO LAUGHS WITH CHILDREN AT THEIR GOD AND AT THEIR CRADLE IS ON OUR SIDE. THE LAWYER WHO DEFENDS AN EDUCATED MURDERER BECAUSE HE IS MORE CULTURED THAN HIS VICTIMS AND COULD NOT HELP MURDERING THEM TO GET MONEY IS ONE OF US. THE SCHOOLBOYS WHO MURDER A PEASANT FOR THE SAKE OF SENSATION ARE OURS. THE JURIES WHO ACQUIT EVERY CRIMINAL ARE OURS. THE PROSECUTOR WHO TREMBLES AT A TRIAL FOR FEAR HE SHOULD NOT SEEM ADVANCED ENOUGH IS OURS, OURS. AMONG OFFICIALS AND LITERARY MEN WE HAVE LOTS, LOTS, AND THEY DON‚ÄÔT KNOW IT THEMSELVES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE DOCILITY OF SCHOOLBOYS AND FOOLS HAS REACHED AN EXTREME PITCH; THE SCHOOLMASTERS ARE BITTER AND BILIOUS. ON ALL SIDES WE SEE VANITY PUFFED UP OUT OF ALL PROPORTION; BRUTAL, MONSTROUS APPETITES.‚Ä¶ DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY WE SHALL CATCH BY LITTLE, READY-MADE IDEAS? WHEN I LEFT RUSSIA, LITTRE‚ÄÔS DICTUM THAT CRIME IS INSANITY WAS ALL THE RAGE; I COME BACK AND I FIND THAT CRIME IS NO LONGER INSANITY, BUT SIMPLY COMMON SENSE, ALMOST A DUTY; ANYWAY, A GALLANT PROTEST. ‚ÄÒHOW CAN WE EXPECT A CULTURED MAN NOT TO COMMIT A MURDER, IF HE IS IN NEED OF MONEY.‚ÄÔ BUT THESE ARE ONLY THE FIRST FRUITS. THE RUSSIAN GOD HAS ALREADY BEEN VANQUISHED BY CHEAP VODKA. THE PEASANTS ARE DRUNK, THE MOTHERS ARE DRUNK, THE CHILDREN ARE DRUNK, THE CHURCHES ARE EMPTY, AND IN THE PEASANT COURTS ONE HEARS, ‚ÄÒTWO HUNDRED LASHES OR STAND US A BUCKET OF VODKA.‚ÄÔ OH, THIS GENERATION HAS ONLY TO GROW UP. IT‚ÄÔS ONLY A PITY WE CAN‚ÄÔT AFFORD TO WAIT, OR WE MIGHT HAVE LET THEM GET A BIT MORE TIPSY! AH, WHAT A PITY THERE‚ÄÔS NO PROLETARIAT! BUT THERE WILL BE, THERE WILL BE; WE ARE GOING THAT WAY.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS A PITY, TOO, THAT WE‚ÄÔVE GROWN GREATER FOOLS,‚ÄÙ MUTTERED STAVROGIN, MOVING FORWARD AS BEFORE.

‚ÄÚLISTEN. I‚ÄÔVE SEEN A CHILD OF SIX YEARS OLD LEADING HOME HIS DRUNKEN MOTHER, WHILST SHE SWORE AT HIM WITH FOUL WORDS. DO YOU SUPPOSE I AM GLAD OF THAT? WHEN IT‚ÄÔS IN OUR HANDS, MAYBE WE‚ÄÔLL MEND THINGS ‚Ä¶ IF NEED BE, WE‚ÄÔLL DRIVE THEM FOR FORTY YEARS INTO THE WILDERNESS.‚Ä¶ BUT ONE OR TWO GENERATIONS OF VICE ARE ESSENTIAL NOW; MONSTROUS, ABJECT VICE BY WHICH A MAN IS TRANSFORMED INTO A LOATHSOME, CRUEL, EGOISTIC REPTILE. THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT WE NEED! AND WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, A LITTLE ‚ÄÒFRESH BLOOD‚ÄÔ THAT WE MAY GET ACCUSTOMED TO IT. WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING? I AM NOT CONTRADICTING MYSELF. I AM ONLY CONTRADICTING THE PHILANTHROPISTS AND SHIGALOVISM, NOT MYSELF! I AM A SCOUNDREL, NOT A SOCIALIST. HA HA HA! I‚ÄÔM ONLY SORRY THERE‚ÄÔS NO TIME. I PROMISED KARMAZINOV TO BEGIN IN MAY, AND TO MAKE AN END BY OCTOBER. IS THAT TOO SOON? HA HA! DO YOU KNOW WHAT, STAVROGIN? THOUGH THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE USE FOUL LANGUAGE, THERE‚ÄÔS NOTHING CYNICAL ABOUT THEM SO FAR. DO YOU KNOW THE SERFS HAD MORE SELF-RESPECT THAN KARMAZINOV? THOUGH THEY WERE BEATEN THEY ALWAYS PRESERVED THEIR GODS, WHICH IS MORE THAN KARMAZINOV‚ÄÔS DONE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, VERHOVENSKY, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I‚ÄÔVE HEARD YOU TALK, AND I LISTEN WITH AMAZEMENT,‚ÄÙ OBSERVED STAVROGIN. ‚ÄÚSO YOU ARE REALLY NOT A SOCIALIST, THEN, BUT SOME SORT OF ‚Ä¶ AMBITIOUS POLITICIAN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚA SCOUNDREL, A SCOUNDREL! YOU ARE WONDERING WHAT I AM. I‚ÄÔLL TELL YOU WHAT I AM DIRECTLY, THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT I AM LEADING UP TO. IT WAS NOT FOR NOTHING THAT I KISSED YOUR HAND. BUT THE PEOPLE MUST BELIEVE THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE AFTER, WHILE THE OTHER SIDE DO NOTHING BUT ‚ÄÒBRANDISH THEIR CUDGELS AND BEAT THEIR OWN FOLLOWERS.‚ÄÔ AH, IF WE ONLY HAD MORE TIME! THAT‚ÄÔS THE ONLY TROUBLE, WE HAVE NO TIME. WE WILL PROCLAIM DESTRUCTION.‚Ä¶ WHY IS IT, WHY IS IT THAT IDEA HAS SUCH A FASCINATION. BUT WE MUST HAVE A LITTLE EXERCISE; WE MUST. WE‚ÄÔLL SET FIRES GOING.‚Ä¶ WE‚ÄÔLL SET LEGENDS GOING. EVERY SCURVY ‚ÄÒGROUP‚ÄÔ WILL BE OF USE. OUT OF THOSE VERY GROUPS I‚ÄÔLL PICK YOU OUT FELLOWS SO KEEN THEY‚ÄÔLL NOT SHRINK FROM SHOOTING, AND BE GRATEFUL FOR THE HONOUR OF A JOB, TOO. WELL, AND THERE WILL BE AN UPHEAVAL! THERE‚ÄÔS GOING TO BE SUCH AN UPSET AS THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE.‚Ä¶ RUSSIA WILL BE OVERWHELMED WITH DARKNESS, THE EARTH WILL WEEP FOR ITS OLD GODS.‚Ä¶ WELL, THEN WE SHALL BRING FORWARD ‚Ä¶ WHOM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHOM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIVAN THE TSAREVITCH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHO-M?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIVAN THE TSAREVITCH. YOU! YOU!‚ÄÙ

STAVROGIN THOUGHT A MINUTE.

‚ÄÚA PRETENDER?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED SUDDENLY, LOOKING WITH INTENSE SURPRISE AT HIS FRANTIC COMPANION. ‚ÄÚAH! SO THAT‚ÄÔS YOUR PLAN AT LAST!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWE SHALL SAY THAT HE IS ‚ÄÒIN HIDING,‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ VERHOVENSKY SAID SOFTLY, IN A SORT OF TENDER WHISPER, AS THOUGH HE REALLY WERE DRUNK INDEED. ‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW THE MAGIC OF THAT PHRASE, ‚ÄÒHE IS IN HIDING‚ÄÔ? BUT HE WILL APPEAR, HE WILL APPEAR. WE‚ÄÔLL SET A LEGEND GOING BETTER THAN THE SKOPTSIS‚ÄÔ. HE EXISTS, BUT NO ONE HAS SEEN HIM. OH, WHAT A LEGEND ONE CAN SET GOING! AND THE GREAT THING IS IT WILL BE A NEW FORCE AT WORK! AND WE NEED THAT; THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT THEY ARE CRYING FOR. WHAT CAN SOCIALISM DO: IT‚ÄÔS DESTROYED THE OLD FORCES BUT HASN‚ÄÔT BROUGHT IN ANY NEW. BUT IN THIS WE HAVE A FORCE, AND WHAT A FORCE! INCREDIBLE. WE ONLY NEED ONE LEVER TO LIFT UP THE EARTH. EVERYTHING WILL RISE UP!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEN HAVE YOU BEEN SERIOUSLY RECKONING ON ME?‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN SAID WITH A MALICIOUS SMILE.

‚ÄÚWHY DO YOU LAUGH, AND SO SPITEFULLY? DON‚ÄÔT FRIGHTEN ME. I AM LIKE A LITTLE CHILD NOW. I CAN BE FRIGHTENED TO DEATH BY ONE SMILE LIKE THAT. LISTEN. I‚ÄÔLL LET NO ONE SEE YOU, NO ONE. SO IT MUST BE. HE EXISTS, BUT NO ONE HAS SEEN HIM; HE IS IN HIDING. AND DO YOU KNOW, ONE MIGHT SHOW YOU, TO ONE OUT OF A HUNDRED-THOUSAND, FOR INSTANCE. AND THE RUMOUR WILL SPREAD OVER ALL THE LAND, ‚ÄÒWE‚ÄÔVE SEEN HIM, WE‚ÄÔVE SEEN HIM.‚ÄÔ

‚ÄÚIVAN FILIPOVITCH THE GOD OF SABAOTH,* HAS BEEN SEEN, TOO, WHEN HE ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN IN HIS CHARIOT IN THE SIGHT OF MEN. THEY SAW HIM WITH THEIR OWN EYES. AND YOU ARE NOT AN IVAN FILIPOVITCH. YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL AND PROUD AS A GOD; YOU ARE SEEKING NOTHING FOR YOURSELF, WITH THE HALO OF A VICTIM ROUND YOU, ‚ÄÒIN HIDING.‚ÄÔ THE GREAT THING IS THE LEGEND. YOU‚ÄÔLL CONQUER THEM, YOU‚ÄÔLL HAVE ONLY TO LOOK, AND YOU WILL CONQUER THEM. HE IS ‚ÄÒIN HIDING,‚ÄÔ AND WILL COME FORTH BRINGING A NEW TRUTH. AND, MEANWHILE, WE‚ÄÔLL PASS TWO OR THREE JUDGMENTS AS WISE AS SOLOMON‚ÄÔS. THE GROUPS, YOU KNOW, THE QUINTETS‚ÄÎWE‚ÄÔVE NO NEED OF NEWSPAPERS. IF OUT OF TEN THOUSAND PETITIONS ONLY ONE IS GRANTED, ALL WOULD COME WITH PETITIONS. IN EVERY PARISH, EVERY PEASANT WILL KNOW THAT THERE IS SOMEWHERE A HOLLOW TREE WHERE PETITIONS ARE TO BE PUT. AND THE WHOLE LAND WILL RESOUND WITH THE CRY, ‚ÄÒA NEW JUST LAW IS TO COME,‚ÄÔ AND THE SEA WILL BE TROUBLED AND THE WHOLE GIMCRACK SHOW WILL FALL TO THE GROUND, AND THEN WE SHALL CONSIDER HOW TO BUILD UP AN EDIFICE OF STONE. FOR THE FIRST TIME! WE ARE GOING TO BUILD IT, WE, AND ONLY WE!‚ÄÙ

     * THE REFERENCE IS TO THE LEGEND CURRENT IN THE SECT OF
     FLAGELLANTS.‚ÄÎTRANSLATOR‚ÄÔS NOTE.
‚ÄÚMADNESS,‚ÄÙ SAID STAVROGIN.

‚ÄÚWHY, WHY DON‚ÄÔT YOU WANT IT? ARE YOU AFRAID? THAT‚ÄÔS WHY I CAUGHT AT YOU, BECAUSE YOU ARE AFRAID OF NOTHING. IS IT UNREASONABLE? BUT YOU SEE, SO FAR I AM COLUMBUS WITHOUT AMERICA. WOULD COLUMBUS WITHOUT AMERICA SEEM REASONABLE?‚ÄÙ

STAVROGIN DID NOT SPEAK. MEANWHILE THEY HAD REACHED THE HOUSE AND STOPPED AT THE ENTRANCE.

‚ÄÚLISTEN,‚ÄÙ VERHOVENSKY BENT DOWN TO HIS EAR. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL DO IT FOR YOU WITHOUT THE MONEY. I‚ÄÔLL SETTLE MARYA TIMOFYEVNA TO-MORROW!‚Ä¶ WITHOUT THE MONEY, AND TO-MORROW I‚ÄÔLL BRING YOU LIZA. WILL YOU HAVE LIZA TO-MORROW?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIS HE REALLY MAD?‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN WONDERED SMILING. THE FRONT DOOR WAS OPENED.

‚ÄÚSTAVROGIN‚ÄÎIS AMERICA OURS?‚ÄÙ SAID VERHOVENSKY, SEIZING HIS HAND FOR THE LAST TIME.

‚ÄÚWHAT FOR?‚ÄÙ SAID NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, GRAVELY AND STERNLY.

‚ÄÚYOU DON‚ÄÔT CARE, I KNEW THAT!‚ÄÙ CRIED VERHOVENSKY IN AN ACCESS OF FURIOUS ANGER. ‚ÄÚYOU ARE LYING, YOU MISERABLE, PROFLIGATE, PERVERTED, LITTLE ARISTOCRAT! I DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE YOU, YOU‚ÄÔVE THE APPETITE OF A WOLF!‚Ä¶ UNDERSTAND THAT YOU‚ÄÔVE COST ME SUCH A PRICE, I CAN‚ÄÔT GIVE YOU UP NOW! THERE‚ÄÔS NO ONE ON EARTH BUT YOU! I INVENTED YOU ABROAD; I INVENTED IT ALL, LOOKING AT YOU. IF I HADN‚ÄÔT WATCHED YOU FROM MY CORNER, NOTHING OF ALL THIS WOULD HAVE ENTERED MY HEAD!‚ÄÙ

STAVROGIN WENT UP THE STEPS WITHOUT ANSWERING.

‚ÄÚSTAVROGIN!‚ÄÙ VERHOVENSKY CALLED AFTER HIM, ‚ÄÚI GIVE YOU A DAY ‚Ä¶ TWO, THEN ‚Ä¶ THREE, THEN; MORE THAN THREE I CAN‚ÄÔT‚ÄÎAND THEN YOU‚ÄÔRE TO ANSWER!‚ÄÙ





CHAPTER IX. A RAID AT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS

MEANWHILE AN INCIDENT HAD OCCURRED WHICH ASTOUNDED ME AND SHATTERED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. AT EIGHT O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE MORNING NASTASYA RAN ROUND TO ME FROM HIM WITH THE NEWS THAT HER MASTER WAS ‚ÄÚRAIDED.‚ÄÙ AT FIRST I COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHAT SHE MEANT; I COULD ONLY GATHER THAT THE ‚ÄÚRAID‚ÄÙ WAS CARRIED OUT BY OFFICIALS, THAT THEY HAD COME AND TAKEN HIS PAPERS, AND THAT A SOLDIER HAD TIED THEM UP IN A BUNDLE AND ‚ÄÚWHEELED THEM AWAY IN A BARROW.‚ÄÙ IT WAS A FANTASTIC STORY. I HURRIED AT ONCE TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.

I FOUND HIM IN A SURPRISING CONDITION: UPSET AND IN GREAT AGITATION, BUT AT THE SAME TIME UNMISTAKABLY TRIUMPHANT. ON THE TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM THE SAMOVAR WAS BOILING, AND THERE WAS A GLASS OF TEA POURED OUT BUT UNTOUCHED AND FORGOTTEN. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS WANDERING ROUND THE TABLE AND PEEPING INTO EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM, UNCONSCIOUS OF WHAT HE WAS DOING. HE WAS WEARING HIS USUAL RED KNITTED JACKET, BUT SEEING ME, HE HURRIEDLY PUT ON HIS COAT AND WAISTCOAT‚ÄÎA THING HE HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE WHEN ANY OF HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS FOUND HIM IN HIS JACKET. HE TOOK ME WARMLY BY THE HAND AT ONCE.

‚ÄÚENFIN UN AMI!‚ÄÙ (HE HEAVED A DEEP SIGH.) ‚ÄÚCHER, I‚ÄÔVE SENT TO YOU ONLY, AND NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING. WE MUST GIVE NASTASYA ORDERS TO LOCK THE DOORS AND NOT ADMIT ANYONE, EXCEPT, OF COURSE THEM.‚Ä¶ VOUS COMPRENEZ?‚ÄÙ

HE LOOKED AT ME UNEASILY, AS THOUGH EXPECTING A REPLY. I MADE HASTE, OF COURSE, TO QUESTION HIM, AND FROM HIS DISCONNECTED AND BROKEN SENTENCES, FULL OF UNNECESSARY PARENTHESES, I SUCCEEDED IN LEARNING THAT AT SEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK THAT MORNING AN OFFICIAL OF THE PROVINCE HAD ‚ÄÒALL OF A SUDDEN‚ÄÔ CALLED ON HIM.

‚ÄÚPARDON, J‚ÄÔAI OUBLI√© SON NOM. IL N‚ÄÔEST PAS DU PAYS, BUT I THINK HE CAME TO THE TOWN WITH LEMBKE, QUELQUE CHOSE DE B√™TE ET D‚ÄÔALLEMAND DANS LA PHYSIONOMIE. IL S‚ÄÔAPPELLE ROSENTHAL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWASN‚ÄÔT IT BLUM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, THAT WAS HIS NAME. VOUS LE CONNAISSEZ? QUELQUE CHOSE D‚ÄÔH√©B√©T√© ET DE TR√®S CONTENT DANS LA FIGURE, POURTANT TR√®S SEV√®RE, ROIDE ET S√©RIEUX. A TYPE OF THE POLICE, OF THE SUBMISSIVE SUBORDINATES, JE M‚ÄÔY CONNAIS. I WAS STILL ASLEEP, AND, WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT, HE ASKED TO HAVE A LOOK AT MY BOOKS AND MANUSCRIPTS! OUI, JE M‚ÄÔEN SOUVIENS, IL A EMPLOY√© CE MOT. HE DID NOT ARREST ME, BUT ONLY THE BOOKS. IL SE TENAIT √† DISTANCE, AND WHEN HE BEGAN TO EXPLAIN HIS VISIT HE LOOKED AS THOUGH I ‚Ä¶ ENFIN IL AVAIT L‚ÄÔAIR DE CROIRE QUE JE TOMBERAI SUR LUI IMM√©DIATEMENT ET QUE JE COMMENCERAI A LE BATTRE COMME PL√¢TRE. TOUS CES GENS DU BAS √©TAGE SONT COMME √ßA WHEN THEY HAVE TO DO WITH A GENTLEMAN. I NEED HARDLY SAY I UNDERSTOOD IT ALL AT ONCE. VOIL√† VINGT ANS QUE JE M‚ÄÔY PR√©PARE. I OPENED ALL THE DRAWERS AND HANDED HIM ALL THE KEYS; I GAVE THEM MYSELF, I GAVE HIM ALL. J‚ÄÔ√©TAIS DIGNE ET CALME. FROM THE BOOKS HE TOOK THE FOREIGN EDITION OF HERZEN, THE BOUND VOLUME OF THE BELL, FOUR COPIES OF MY POEM, ET ENFIN TOUT √ßA. THEN HE TOOK MY LETTERS AND MY PAPERS ET QUELQUES-UNES DE MES √©BAUCHES HISTORIQUES, CRITIQUES ET POLITIQUES. ALL THAT THEY CARRIED OFF. NASTASYA SAYS THAT A SOLDIER WHEELED THEM AWAY IN A BARROW AND COVERED THEM WITH AN APRON; OUI, C‚ÄÔEST CELA, WITH AN APRON.‚ÄÙ IT SOUNDED LIKE DELIRIUM. WHO COULD MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF IT? I PELTED HIM WITH QUESTIONS AGAIN. HAD BLUM COME ALONE, OR WITH OTHERS? ON WHOSE AUTHORITY? BY WHAT RIGHT? HOW HAD HE DARED? HOW DID HE EXPLAIN IT?

‚ÄÚIL ETAIT SEUL, BIEN SEUL, BUT THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE DANS L‚ÄÔANTICHAMBRE, OUI, JE M‚ÄÔEN SOUVIENS, ET PUIS ‚Ä¶ THOUGH I BELIEVE THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE BESIDES, AND THERE WAS A GUARD STANDING IN THE ENTRY. YOU MUST ASK NASTASYA; SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT BETTER THAN I DO. J‚ÄÔ√©TAIS SUREXCIT√©, VOYEZ-VOUS. IL PARLAIT, IL PARLAIT ‚Ä¶ UN TAS DE CHASES; HE SAID VERY LITTLE THOUGH, IT WAS I SAID ALL THAT.‚Ä¶ I TOLD HIM THE STORY OF MY LIFE, SIMPLY FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW, OF COURSE. J‚ÄÔ√©TAIS SUREXCIT√©, MAIS DIGNE, JE VOUS ASSURE.‚Ä¶ I AM AFRAID, THOUGH, I MAY HAVE SHED TEARS. THEY GOT THE BARROW FROM THE SHOP NEXT DOOR.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, HEAVENS! HOW COULD ALL THIS HAVE HAPPENED? BUT FOR MERCY‚ÄÔS SAKE, SPEAK MORE EXACTLY, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. WHAT YOU TELL ME SOUNDS LIKE A DREAM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCHER, I FEEL AS THOUGH I WERE IN A DREAM MYSELF.‚Ä¶ SAVEZ-VOUS! IL A PRONONC√© LE NOM DE TELYATNIKOF, AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT MAN WAS CONCEALED IN THE ENTRY. YES, I REMEMBER, HE SUGGESTED CALLING THE PROSECUTOR AND DMITRI DMITRITCH, I BELIEVE ‚Ä¶ QUI ME DOIT ENCORE QUINZE ROUBLES I WON AT CARDS, SOIT DIT EN PASSANT. ENFIN, JE N‚ÄÔAI PAS TROP COMPRIS. BUT I GOT THE BETTER OF THEM, AND WHAT DO I CARE FOR DMITRI DMITRITCH? I BELIEVE I BEGGED HIM VERY EARNESTLY TO KEEP IT QUIET; I BEGGED HIM PARTICULARLY, MOST PARTICULARLY. I AM AFRAID I DEMEANED MYSELF, IN FACT, COMMENT CROYEZ-VOUS? ENFIN IL A CONSENTI. YES, I REMEMBER, HE SUGGESTED THAT HIMSELF‚ÄÎTHAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO KEEP IT QUIET, FOR HE HAD ONLY COME ‚ÄÒTO HAVE A LOOK ROUND‚ÄÔ ET RIEN DE PLUS, AND NOTHING MORE, NOTHING MORE ‚Ä¶ AND THAT IF THEY FIND NOTHING, NOTHING WILL HAPPEN. SO THAT WE ENDED IT ALL EN AMIS, JE SUIS TOUT √† FAIT CONTENT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, THEN HE SUGGESTED THE USUAL COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS IN SUCH CASES AND REGULAR GUARANTEES, AND YOU REJECTED THEM YOURSELF,‚ÄÙ I CRIED WITH FRIENDLY INDIGNATION.

‚ÄÚYES, IT‚ÄÔS BETTER WITHOUT THE GUARANTEES. AND WHY MAKE A SCANDAL? LET‚ÄÔS KEEP IT EN AMIS SO LONG AS WE CAN. YOU KNOW, IN OUR TOWN, IF THEY GET TO KNOW IT ‚Ä¶ MES ENNEMIS, ET PUIS, √† QUOI BON, LE PROCUREUR, CE COCHON DE NOTRE PROCUREUR, QUI DEUX FOIS M‚ÄÔA MANQU√© DE POLITESSE ET QU‚ÄÔON A ROSS√© √† PLAISIR L‚ÄÔAUTRE ANN√©E CHEZ CETTE CHARMANTE ET BELLE NATALYA PAVLOVNA QUAND IL SE CACHA DANS SON BOUDOIR. ET PUIS, MON AMI, DON‚ÄÔT MAKE OBJECTIONS AND DON‚ÄÔT DEPRESS ME, I BEG YOU, FOR NOTHING IS MORE UNBEARABLE WHEN A MAN IS IN TROUBLE THAN FOR A HUNDRED FRIENDS TO POINT OUT TO HIM WHAT A FOOL HE HAS MADE OF HIMSELF. SIT DOWN THOUGH AND HAVE SOME TEA. I MUST ADMIT I AM AWFULLY TIRED.‚Ä¶ HADN‚ÄÔT I BETTER LIE DOWN AND PUT VINEGAR ON MY HEAD? WHAT DO YOU THINK?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCERTAINLY,‚ÄÙ I CRIED, ‚ÄÚICE EVEN. YOU ARE VERY MUCH UPSET. YOU ARE PALE AND YOUR HANDS ARE TREMBLING. LIE DOWN, REST, AND PUT OFF TELLING ME. I‚ÄÔLL SIT BY YOU AND WAIT.‚ÄÙ

HE HESITATED, BUT I INSISTED ON HIS LYING DOWN. NASTASYA BROUGHT A CUP OF VINEGAR. I WETTED A TOWEL AND LAID IT ON HIS HEAD. THEN NASTASYA STOOD ON A CHAIR AND BEGAN LIGHTING A LAMP BEFORE THE IKON IN THE CORNER. I NOTICED THIS WITH SURPRISE; THERE HAD NEVER BEEN A LAMP THERE BEFORE AND NOW SUDDENLY IT HAD MADE ITS APPEARANCE.

‚ÄÚI ARRANGED FOR THAT AS SOON AS THEY HAD GONE AWAY,‚ÄÙ MUTTERED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, LOOKING AT ME SLYLY. ‚ÄÚQUAND ON A DE CES CHOSES-L√† DANS SA CHAMBRE ET QU‚ÄÔON VIENT VOUS ARR√™TER IT MAKES AN IMPRESSION AND THEY ARE SURE TO REPORT THAT THEY HAVE SEEN IT.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

WHEN SHE HAD DONE THE LAMP, NASTASYA STOOD IN THE DOORWAY, LEANED HER CHEEK IN HER RIGHT HAND, AND BEGAN GAZING AT HIM WITH A LACHRYMOSE AIR.

‚ÄÚELOIGNEZ-LA ON SOME EXCUSE,‚ÄÙ HE NODDED TO ME FROM THE SOFA. ‚ÄÚI CAN‚ÄÔT ENDURE THIS RUSSIAN SYMPATHY, ET PUIS √ßA M‚ÄÔEMB√™TE.‚ÄÙ

BUT SHE WENT AWAY OF HERSELF. I NOTICED THAT HE KEPT LOOKING TOWARDS THE DOOR AND LISTENING FOR SOUNDS IN THE PASSAGE.

‚ÄÚIL FAUT √™TRE PR√™T, VOYEZ-VOUS,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, LOOKING AT ME SIGNIFICANTLY, ‚ÄÚCHAQUE MOMENT ‚Ä¶ THEY MAY COME AND TAKE ONE AND, PHEW!‚ÄÎA MAN DISAPPEARS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHEAVENS! WHO‚ÄÔLL COME? WHO WILL TAKE YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚVOYEZ-VOUS, MON CHER, I ASKED STRAIGHT OUT WHEN HE WAS GOING AWAY, WHAT WOULD THEY DO TO ME NOW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔD BETTER HAVE ASKED THEM WHERE YOU‚ÄÔD BE EXILED!‚ÄÙ I CRIED OUT IN THE SAME INDIGNATION.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS JUST WHAT I MEANT WHEN I ASKED, BUT HE WENT AWAY WITHOUT ANSWERING. VOYEZ-VOUS: AS FOR LINEN, CLOTHES, WARM THINGS ESPECIALLY, THAT MUST BE AS THEY DECIDE; IF THEY TELL ME TO TAKE THEM‚ÄÎALL RIGHT, OR THEY MIGHT SEND ME IN A SOLDIER‚ÄÔS OVERCOAT. BUT I THRUST THIRTY-FIVE ROUBLES‚ÄÙ (HE SUDDENLY DROPPED HIS VOICE, LOOKING TOWARDS THE DOOR BY WHICH NASTASYA HAD GONE OUT) ‚ÄÚIN A SLIT IN MY WAISTCOAT POCKET, HERE, FEEL.‚Ä¶ I BELIEVE THEY WON‚ÄÔT TAKE THE WAISTCOAT OFF, AND LEFT SEVEN ROUBLES IN MY PURSE TO KEEP UP APPEARANCES, AS THOUGH THAT WERE ALL I HAVE. YOU SEE, IT‚ÄÔS IN SMALL CHANGE AND THE COPPERS ARE ON THE TABLE, SO THEY WON‚ÄÔT GUESS THAT I‚ÄÔVE HIDDEN THE MONEY, BUT WILL SUPPOSE THAT THAT‚ÄÔS ALL. FOR GOD KNOWS WHERE I MAY HAVE TO SLEEP TO-NIGHT!‚ÄÙ

I BOWED MY HEAD BEFORE SUCH MADNESS. IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT A MAN COULD NOT BE ARRESTED AND SEARCHED IN THE WAY HE WAS DESCRIBING, AND HE MUST HAVE MIXED THINGS UP. IT‚ÄÔS TRUE IT ALL HAPPENED IN THE DAYS BEFORE OUR PRESENT, MORE RECENT REGULATIONS. IT IS TRUE, TOO, THAT ACCORDING TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT THEY HAD OFFERED TO FOLLOW THE MORE REGULAR PROCEDURE, BUT HE ‚ÄÚGOT THE BETTER OF THEM‚ÄÙ AND REFUSED.‚Ä¶ OF COURSE NOT LONG AGO A GOVERNOR MIGHT, IN EXTREME CASES.‚Ä¶ BUT HOW COULD THIS BE AN EXTREME CASE? THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT BAFFLED ME.

‚ÄÚNO DOUBT THEY HAD A TELEGRAM FROM PETERSBURG,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SAID SUDDENLY.

‚ÄÚA TELEGRAM? ABOUT YOU? BECAUSE OF THE WORKS OF HERZEN AND YOUR POEM? HAVE YOU TAKEN LEAVE OF YOUR SENSES? WHAT IS THERE IN THAT TO ARREST YOU FOR?‚ÄÙ

I WAS POSITIVELY ANGRY. HE MADE A GRIMACE AND WAS EVIDENTLY MORTIFIED‚ÄÎNOT AT MY EXCLAMATION, BUT AT THE IDEA THAT THERE WAS NO GROUND FOR ARREST.

‚ÄÚWHO CAN TELL IN OUR DAY WHAT HE MAY NOT BE ARRESTED FOR?‚ÄÙ HE MUTTERED ENIGMATICALLY.

A WILD AND NONSENSICAL IDEA CROSSED MY MIND.

‚ÄÚSTEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, TELL ME AS A FRIEND,‚ÄÙ I CRIED, ‚ÄÚAS A REAL FRIEND, I WILL NOT BETRAY YOU: DO YOU BELONG TO SOME SECRET SOCIETY OR NOT?‚ÄÙ

AND ON THIS, TO MY AMAZEMENT, HE WAS NOT QUITE CERTAIN WHETHER HE WAS OR WAS NOT A MEMBER OF SOME SECRET SOCIETY.

‚ÄÚTHAT DEPENDS, VOYEZ-VOUS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW DO YOU MEAN ‚ÄÒIT DEPENDS‚ÄÔ?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHEN WITH ONE‚ÄÔS WHOLE HEART ONE IS AN ADHERENT OF PROGRESS AND ‚Ä¶ WHO CAN ANSWER IT? YOU MAY SUPPOSE YOU DON‚ÄÔT BELONG, AND SUDDENLY IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU DO BELONG TO SOMETHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? IT‚ÄÔS A CASE OF YES OR NO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCELA DATE DE P√©TERSBURG WHEN SHE AND I WERE MEANING TO FOUND A MAGAZINE THERE. THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT‚ÄÔS AT THE ROOT OF IT. SHE GAVE THEM THE SLIP THEN, AND THEY FORGOT US, BUT NOW THEY‚ÄÔVE REMEMBERED. CHER, CHER, DON‚ÄÔT YOU KNOW ME?‚ÄÙ HE CRIED HYSTERICALLY. ‚ÄÚAND THEY‚ÄÔLL TAKE US, PUT US IN A CART, AND MARCH US OFF TO SIBERIA FOREVER, OR FORGET US IN PRISON.‚ÄÙ

AND HE SUDDENLY BROKE INTO BITTER WEEPING. HIS TEARS POSITIVELY STREAMED. HE COVERED HIS FACE WITH HIS RED SILK HANDKERCHIEF AND SOBBED, SOBBED CONVULSIVELY FOR FIVE MINUTES. IT WRUNG MY HEART. THIS WAS THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN A PROPHET AMONG US FOR TWENTY YEARS, A LEADER, A PATRIARCH, THE KUKOLNIK WHO HAD BORNE HIMSELF SO LOFTILY AND MAJESTICALLY BEFORE ALL OF US, BEFORE WHOM WE BOWED DOWN WITH GENUINE REVERENCE, FEELING PROUD OF DOING SO‚ÄÎAND ALL OF A SUDDEN HERE HE WAS SOBBING, SOBBING LIKE A NAUGHTY CHILD WAITING FOR THE ROD WHICH THE TEACHER IS FETCHING FOR HIM. I FELT FEARFULLY SORRY FOR HIM. HE BELIEVED IN THE REALITY OF THAT ‚ÄÚCART‚ÄÙ AS HE BELIEVED THAT I WAS SITTING BY HIS SIDE, AND HE EXPECTED IT THAT MORNING, AT ONCE, THAT VERY MINUTE, AND ALL THIS ON ACCOUNT OF HIS HERZEN AND SOME POEM! SUCH COMPLETE, ABSOLUTE IGNORANCE OF EVERYDAY REALITY WAS TOUCHING AND SOMEHOW REPULSIVE.

AT LAST HE LEFT OFF CRYING, GOT UP FROM THE SOFA AND BEGAN WALKING ABOUT THE ROOM AGAIN, CONTINUING TO TALK TO ME, THOUGH HE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW EVERY MINUTE AND LISTENED TO EVERY SOUND IN THE PASSAGE. OUR CONVERSATION WAS STILL DISCONNECTED. ALL MY ASSURANCES AND ATTEMPTS TO CONSOLE HIM REBOUNDED FROM HIM LIKE PEAS FROM A WALL. HE SCARCELY LISTENED, BUT YET WHAT HE NEEDED WAS THAT I SHOULD CONSOLE HIM AND KEEP ON TALKING WITH THAT OBJECT. I SAW THAT HE COULD NOT DO WITHOUT ME NOW, AND WOULD NOT LET ME GO FOR ANYTHING. I REMAINED, AND WE SPENT MORE THAN TWO HOURS TOGETHER. IN CONVERSATION HE RECALLED THAT BLUM HAD TAKEN WITH HIM TWO MANIFESTOES HE HAD FOUND.

‚ÄÚMANIFESTOES!‚ÄÙ I SAID, FOOLISHLY FRIGHTENED. ‚ÄÚDO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, TEN WERE LEFT HERE,‚ÄÙ HE ANSWERED WITH VEXATION (HE TALKED TO ME AT ONE MOMENT IN A VEXED AND HAUGHTY TONE AND AT THE NEXT WITH DREADFUL PLAINTIVENESS AND HUMILIATION), ‚ÄÚBUT I HAD DISPOSED OF EIGHT ALREADY, AND BLUM ONLY FOUND TWO.‚ÄÙ AND HE SUDDENLY FLUSHED WITH INDIGNATION. ‚ÄÚVOUS ME METTEZ AVEC CES GENS-L√†! DO YOU SUPPOSE I COULD BE WORKING WITH THOSE SCOUNDRELS, THOSE ANONYMOUS LIBELLERS, WITH MY SON PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, AVEC CES ESPRITS FORTS DE L√¢CHET√©? OH, HEAVENS!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBAH! HAVEN‚ÄÔT THEY MIXED YOU UP PERHAPS?‚Ä¶ BUT IT‚ÄÔS NONSENSE, IT CAN‚ÄÔT BE SO,‚ÄÙ I OBSERVED.

‚ÄÚSAVEZ-VOUS,‚ÄÙ BROKE FROM HIM SUDDENLY, ‚ÄÚI FEEL AT MOMENTS QUE JE FERAI L√†-BAS QUELQUE ESCLANDRE. OH, DON‚ÄÔT GO AWAY, DON‚ÄÔT LEAVE ME ALONE! MA CARRI√®RE EST FINIE AUJOURD‚ÄÔHUI, JE LE SENS. DO YOU KNOW, I MIGHT FALL ON SOMEBODY THERE AND BITE HIM, LIKE THAT LIEUTENANT.‚ÄÙ

HE LOOKED AT ME WITH A STRANGE EXPRESSION‚ÄÎALARMED, AND AT THE SAME TIME ANXIOUS TO ALARM ME. HE CERTAINLY WAS GETTING MORE AND MORE EXASPERATED WITH SOMEBODY AND ABOUT SOMETHING AS TIME WENT ON AND THE POLICE-CART DID NOT APPEAR; HE WAS POSITIVELY WRATHFUL. SUDDENLY NASTASYA, WHO HAD COME FROM THE KITCHEN INTO THE PASSAGE FOR SOME REASON, UPSET A CLOTHES-HORSE THERE. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH TREMBLED AND TURNED NUMB WITH TERROR AS HE SAT; BUT WHEN THE NOISE WAS EXPLAINED, HE ALMOST SHRIEKED AT NASTASYA AND, STAMPING, DROVE HER BACK TO THE KITCHEN. A MINUTE LATER HE SAID, LOOKING AT ME IN DESPAIR: ‚ÄÚI AM RUINED! CHER‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHE SAT DOWN SUDDENLY BESIDE ME AND LOOKED PITEOUSLY INTO MY FACE‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚCHER, IT‚ÄÔS NOT SIBERIA I AM AFRAID OF, I SWEAR. OH, JE VOUS JURE!‚ÄÙ (TEARS POSITIVELY STOOD IN HIS EYES.) ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS SOMETHING ELSE I FEAR.‚ÄÙ

I SAW FROM HIS EXPRESSION THAT HE WANTED AT LAST TO TELL ME SOMETHING OF GREAT IMPORTANCE WHICH HE HAD TILL NOW REFRAINED FROM TELLING.

‚ÄÚI AM AFRAID OF DISGRACE,‚ÄÙ HE WHISPERED MYSTERIOUSLY.

‚ÄÚWHAT DISGRACE? ON THE CONTRARY! BELIEVE ME, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, THAT ALL THIS WILL BE EXPLAINED TO-DAY AND WILL END TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚARE YOU SO SURE THAT THEY WILL PARDON ME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPARDON YOU? WHAT! WHAT A WORD! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? I ASSURE YOU YOU‚ÄÔVE DONE NOTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚQU‚ÄÔEN SAVEZ-VOUS; ALL MY LIFE HAS BEEN ‚Ä¶ CHER ‚Ä¶ THEY‚ÄÔLL REMEMBER EVERYTHING ‚Ä¶ AND IF THEY FIND NOTHING, IT WILL BE WORSE STILL,‚ÄÙ HE ADDED ALL OF A SUDDEN, UNEXPECTEDLY.

‚ÄÚHOW DO YOU MEAN IT WILL BE WORSE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT WILL BE WORSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMY FRIEND, LET IT BE SIBERIA, ARCHANGEL, LOSS OF RIGHTS‚ÄÎIF I MUST PERISH, LET ME PERISH! BUT ‚Ä¶ I AM AFRAID OF SOMETHING ELSE.‚ÄÙ (AGAIN WHISPERING, A SCARED FACE, MYSTERY.)

‚ÄÚBUT OF WHAT? OF WHAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEY‚ÄÔLL FLOG ME,‚ÄÙ HE PRONOUNCED, LOOKING AT ME WITH A FACE OF DESPAIR.

‚ÄÚWHO‚ÄÔLL FLOG YOU? WHAT FOR? WHERE?‚ÄÙ I CRIED, FEELING ALARMED THAT HE WAS GOING OUT OF HIS MIND.

‚ÄÚWHERE? WHY THERE ‚Ä¶ WHERE ‚ÄÒTHAT‚ÄÔS‚ÄÔ DONE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT WHERE IS IT DONE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEH, CHER,‚ÄÙ HE WHISPERED ALMOST IN MY EAR. ‚ÄÚTHE FLOOR SUDDENLY GIVES WAY UNDER YOU, YOU DROP HALF THROUGH.‚Ä¶ EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLEGENDS!‚ÄÙ I CRIED, GUESSING WHAT HE MEANT. ‚ÄÚOLD TALES. CAN YOU HAVE BELIEVED THEM TILL NOW?‚ÄÙ I LAUGHED.

‚ÄÚTALES! BUT THERE MUST BE FOUNDATION FOR THEM; FLOGGED MEN TELL NO TALES. I‚ÄÔVE IMAGINED IT TEN THOUSAND TIMES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT YOU, WHY YOU? YOU‚ÄÔVE DONE NOTHING, YOU KNOW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT MAKES IT WORSE. THEY‚ÄÔLL FIND OUT I‚ÄÔVE DONE NOTHING AND FLOG ME FOR IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND YOU ARE SURE THAT YOU‚ÄÔLL BE TAKEN TO PETERSBURG FOR THAT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMY FRIEND, I‚ÄÔVE TOLD YOU ALREADY THAT I REGRET NOTHING, MA CARRI√®RE EST FINIE. FROM THAT HOUR WHEN SHE SAID GOOD-BYE TO ME AT SKVORESHNIKI MY LIFE HAS HAD NO VALUE FOR ME ‚Ä¶ BUT DISGRACE, DISGRACE, QUE DIRA-T-ELLE IF SHE FINDS OUT?‚ÄÙ

HE LOOKED AT ME IN DESPAIR. AND THE POOR FELLOW FLUSHED ALL OVER. I DROPPED MY EYES TOO.

‚ÄÚSHE‚ÄÔLL FIND OUT NOTHING, FOR NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO YOU. I FEEL AS IF I WERE SPEAKING TO YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, YOU‚ÄÔVE ASTONISHED ME SO THIS MORNING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT, MY FRIEND, THIS ISN‚ÄÔT FEAR. FOR EVEN IF I AM PARDONED, EVEN IF I AM BROUGHT HERE AND NOTHING IS DONE TO ME‚ÄÎTHEN I AM UNDONE. ELLE ME SOUP√ßONNERA TOUTE SA VIE‚ÄÎME, ME, THE POET, THE THINKER, THE MAN WHOM SHE HAS WORSHIPPED FOR TWENTY-TWO YEARS!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT WILL NEVER ENTER HER HEAD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT WILL,‚ÄÙ HE WHISPERED WITH PROFOUND CONVICTION. ‚ÄÚWE‚ÄÔVE TALKED OF IT SEVERAL TIMES IN PETERSBURG, IN LENT, BEFORE WE CAME AWAY, WHEN WE WERE BOTH AFRAID.‚Ä¶ ELLE ME SOUP√ßONNERA TOUTE SA VIE ‚Ä¶ AND HOW CAN I DISABUSE HER? IT WON‚ÄÔT SOUND LIKELY. AND IN THIS WRETCHED TOWN WHO‚ÄÔD BELIEVE IT, C‚ÄÔEST INVRAISEMBLABLE.‚Ä¶ ET PUIS LES FEMMES, SHE WILL BE PLEASED. SHE WILL BE GENUINELY GRIEVED LIKE A TRUE FRIEND, BUT SECRETLY SHE WILL BE PLEASED.‚Ä¶ I SHALL GIVE HER A WEAPON AGAINST ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. OH, IT‚ÄÔS ALL OVER WITH ME! TWENTY YEARS OF SUCH PERFECT HAPPINESS WITH HER ‚Ä¶ AND NOW!‚ÄÙ HE HID HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS.

‚ÄÚSTEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, OUGHTN‚ÄÔT YOU TO LET VARVARA PETROVNA KNOW AT ONCE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED?‚ÄÙ I SUGGESTED.

‚ÄÚGOD PRESERVE ME!‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, SHUDDERING AND LEAPING UP FROM HIS PLACE. ‚ÄÚON NO ACCOUNT, NEVER, AFTER WHAT WAS SAID AT PARTING AT SKVORESHNIKI‚ÄÎNEVER!‚ÄÙ

HIS EYES FLASHED.

WE WENT ON SITTING TOGETHER ANOTHER HOUR OR MORE, I BELIEVE, EXPECTING SOMETHING ALL THE TIME‚ÄÎTHE IDEA HAD TAKEN SUCH HOLD OF US. HE LAY DOWN AGAIN, EVEN CLOSED HIS EYES, AND LAY FOR TWENTY MINUTES WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD, SO THAT I THOUGHT HE WAS ASLEEP OR UNCONSCIOUS. SUDDENLY HE GOT UP IMPULSIVELY, PULLED THE TOWEL OFF HIS HEAD, JUMPED UP FROM THE SOFA, RUSHED TO THE LOOKING-GLASS, WITH TREMBLING HANDS TIED HIS CRAVAT, AND IN A VOICE OF THUNDER CALLED TO NASTASYA, TELLING HER TO GIVE HIM HIS OVERCOAT, HIS NEW HAT AND HIS STICK.

‚ÄÚI CAN BEAR NO MORE,‚ÄÙ HE SAID IN A BREAKING VOICE. ‚ÄÚI CAN‚ÄÔT, I CAN‚ÄÔT! I AM GOING MYSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHERE?‚ÄÙ I CRIED, JUMPING UP TOO.

‚ÄÚTO LEMBKE. CHER, I OUGHT, I AM OBLIGED. IT‚ÄÔS MY DUTY. I AM A CITIZEN AND A MAN, NOT A WORTHLESS CHIP. I HAVE RIGHTS; I WANT MY RIGHTS.‚Ä¶ FOR TWENTY YEARS I‚ÄÔVE NOT INSISTED ON MY RIGHTS. ALL MY LIFE I‚ÄÔVE NEGLECTED THEM CRIMINALLY ‚Ä¶ BUT NOW I‚ÄÔLL DEMAND THEM. HE MUST TELL ME EVERYTHING‚ÄÎEVERYTHING. HE RECEIVED A TELEGRAM. HE DARE NOT TORTURE ME; IF SO, LET HIM ARREST ME, LET HIM ARREST ME!‚ÄÙ

HE STAMPED AND VOCIFERATED ALMOST WITH SHRIEKS. ‚ÄÚI APPROVE OF WHAT YOU SAY,‚ÄÙ I SAID, SPEAKING AS CALMLY AS POSSIBLE, ON PURPOSE, THOUGH I WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID FOR HIM.

‚ÄÚCERTAINLY IT IS BETTER THAN SITTING HERE IN SUCH MISERY, BUT I CAN‚ÄÔT APPROVE OF YOUR STATE OF MIND. JUST SEE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE AND IN WHAT A STATE YOU ARE GOING THERE! IL FAUT √™TRE DIGNE ET CALME AVEC LEMBKE. YOU REALLY MIGHT RUSH AT SOMEONE THERE AND BITE HIM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM GIVING MYSELF UP. I AM WALKING STRAIGHT INTO THE JAWS OF THE LION.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL GO WITH YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI EXPECTED NO LESS OF YOU, I ACCEPT YOUR SACRIFICE, THE SACRIFICE OF A TRUE FRIEND; BUT ONLY AS FAR AS THE HOUSE, ONLY AS FAR AS THE HOUSE. YOU OUGHT NOT, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO COMPROMISE YOURSELF FURTHER BY BEING MY CONFEDERATE. OH, CROYEZ-MOI, JE SERAI CALME. I FEEL THAT I AM AT THIS MOMENT √† LA HAUTEUR DE TOUT CE QUE IL Y A DE PLUS SACR√©.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI MAY PERHAPS GO INTO THE HOUSE WITH YOU,‚ÄÙ I INTERRUPTED HIM. ‚ÄÚI HAD A MESSAGE FROM THEIR STUPID COMMITTEE YESTERDAY THROUGH VYSOTSKY THAT THEY RECKON ON ME AND INVITE ME TO THE F√™TE TO-MORROW AS ONE OF THE STEWARDS OR WHATEVER IT IS ‚Ä¶ ONE OF THE SIX YOUNG MEN WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO LOOK AFTER THE TRAYS, WAIT ON THE LADIES, TAKE THE GUESTS TO THEIR PLACES, AND WEAR A ROSETTE OF CRIMSON AND WHITE RIBBON ON THE LEFT SHOULDER. I MEANT TO REFUSE, BUT NOW WHY SHOULDN‚ÄÔT I GO INTO THE HOUSE ON THE EXCUSE OF SEEING YULIA MIHAILOVNA HERSELF ABOUT IT?‚Ä¶ SO WE WILL GO IN TOGETHER.‚ÄÙ

HE LISTENED, NODDING, BUT I THINK HE UNDERSTOOD NOTHING. WE STOOD ON THE THRESHOLD.

‚ÄÚCHER‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHE STRETCHED OUT HIS ARM TO THE LAMP BEFORE THE IKON‚ÄÎ‚ÄÙCHER, I HAVE NEVER BELIEVED IN THIS, BUT ‚Ä¶ SO BE IT, SO BE IT!‚ÄÙ HE CROSSED HIMSELF. ‚ÄÚALLONS!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, THAT‚ÄÔS BETTER SO,‚ÄÙ I THOUGHT AS I WENT OUT ON TO THE STEPS WITH HIM. ‚ÄÚTHE FRESH AIR WILL DO HIM GOOD ON THE WAY, AND WE SHALL CALM DOWN, TURN BACK, AND GO HOME TO BED.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

BUT I RECKONED WITHOUT MY HOST. ON THE WAY AN ADVENTURE OCCURRED WHICH AGITATED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH EVEN MORE, AND FINALLY DETERMINED HIM TO GO ON ‚Ä¶ SO THAT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE EXPECTED OF OUR FRIEND SO MUCH SPIRIT AS HE SUDDENLY DISPLAYED THAT MORNING. POOR FRIEND, KIND-HEARTED FRIEND!





CHAPTER X. FILIBUSTERS. A FATAL MORNING

I

THE ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL US ON THE WAY WAS ALSO A SURPRISING ONE. BUT I MUST TELL THE STORY IN DUE ORDER. AN HOUR BEFORE STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH AND I CAME OUT INTO THE STREET, A CROWD OF PEOPLE, THE HANDS FROM SHPIGULINS‚ÄÔ FACTORY, SEVENTY OR MORE IN NUMBER, HAD BEEN MARCHING THROUGH THE TOWN, AND HAD BEEN AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY TO MANY SPECTATORS. THEY WALKED INTENTIONALLY IN GOOD ORDER AND ALMOST IN SILENCE. AFTERWARDS IT WAS ASSERTED THAT THESE SEVENTY HAD BEEN ELECTED OUT OF THE WHOLE NUMBER OF FACTORY HANDS, AMOUNTING TO ABOUT NINE HUNDRED, TO GO TO THE GOVERNOR AND TO TRY AND GET FROM HIM, IN THE ABSENCE OF THEIR EMPLOYER, A JUST SETTLEMENT OF THEIR GRIEVANCES AGAINST THE MANAGER, WHO, IN CLOSING THE FACTORY AND DISMISSING THE WORKMEN, HAD CHEATED THEM ALL IN AN IMPUDENT WAY‚ÄÎA FACT WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN PROVED CONCLUSIVELY. SOME PEOPLE STILL DENY THAT THERE WAS ANY ELECTION OF DELEGATES, MAINTAINING THAT SEVENTY WAS TOO LARGE A NUMBER TO ELECT, AND THAT THE CROWD SIMPLY CONSISTED OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN MOST UNFAIRLY TREATED, AND THAT THEY ONLY CAME TO ASK FOR HELP IN THEIR OWN CASE, SO THAT THE GENERAL ‚ÄÚMUTINY‚ÄÙ OF THE FACTORY WORKERS, ABOUT WHICH THERE WAS SUCH AN UPROAR LATER ON, HAD NEVER EXISTED AT ALL. OTHERS FIERCELY MAINTAINED THAT THESE SEVENTY MEN WERE NOT SIMPLE STRIKERS BUT REVOLUTIONISTS, THAT IS, NOT MERELY THAT THEY WERE THE MOST TURBULENT, BUT THAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN WORKED UPON BY SEDITIOUS MANIFESTOES. THE FACT IS, IT IS STILL UNCERTAIN WHETHER THERE HAD BEEN ANY OUTSIDE INFLUENCE OR INCITEMENT AT WORK OR NOT. MY PRIVATE OPINION IS THAT THE WORKMEN HAD NOT READ THE SEDITIOUS MANIFESTOES AT ALL, AND IF THEY HAD READ THEM, WOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD ONE WORD, FOR ONE REASON BECAUSE THE AUTHORS OF SUCH LITERATURE WRITE VERY OBSCURELY IN SPITE OF THE BOLDNESS OF THEIR STYLE. BUT AS THE WORKMEN REALLY WERE IN A DIFFICULT PLIGHT AND THE POLICE TO WHOM THEY APPEALED WOULD NOT ENTER INTO THEIR GRIEVANCES, WHAT COULD BE MORE NATURAL THAN THEIR IDEA OF GOING IN A BODY TO ‚ÄÚTHE GENERAL HIMSELF‚ÄÙ IF POSSIBLE, WITH THE PETITION AT THEIR HEAD, FORMING UP IN AN ORDERLY WAY BEFORE HIS DOOR, AND AS SOON AS HE SHOWED HIMSELF, ALL FALLING ON THEIR KNEES AND CRYING OUT TO HIM AS TO PROVIDENCE ITSELF? TO MY MIND THERE IS NO NEED TO SEE IN THIS A MUTINY OR EVEN A DEPUTATION, FOR IT‚ÄÔS A TRADITIONAL, HISTORICAL MODE OF ACTION; THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS LOVED TO PARLEY WITH ‚ÄÚTHE GENERAL HIMSELF‚ÄÙ FOR THE MERE SATISFACTION OF DOING SO, REGARDLESS OF HOW THE CONVERSATION MAY END.

AND SO I AM QUITE CONVINCED THAT, EVEN THOUGH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, LIPUTIN, AND PERHAPS SOME OTHERS‚ÄÎPERHAPS EVEN FEDKA TOO‚ÄÎHAD BEEN FLITTING ABOUT AMONG THE WORKPEOPLE TALKING TO THEM (AND THERE IS FAIRLY GOOD EVIDENCE OF THIS), THEY HAD ONLY APPROACHED TWO, THREE, FIVE AT THE MOST, TRYING TO SOUND THEM, AND NOTHING HAD COME OF THEIR CONVERSATION. AS FOR THE MUTINY THEY ADVOCATED, IF THE FACTORY-WORKERS DID UNDERSTAND ANYTHING OF THEIR PROPAGANDA, THEY WOULD HAVE LEFT OFF LISTENING TO IT AT ONCE AS TO SOMETHING STUPID THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM. FEDKA WAS A DIFFERENT MATTER: HE HAD MORE SUCCESS, I BELIEVE, THAN PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. TWO WORKMEN ARE NOW KNOWN FOR A FACT TO HAVE ASSISTED FEDKA IN CAUSING THE FIRE IN THE TOWN WHICH OCCURRED THREE DAYS AFTERWARDS, AND A MONTH LATER THREE MEN WHO HAD WORKED IN THE FACTORY WERE ARRESTED FOR ROBBERY AND ARSON IN THE PROVINCE. BUT IF IN THESE CASES FEDKA DID LURE THEM TO DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE ACTION, HE COULD ONLY HAVE SUCCEEDED WITH THESE FIVE, FOR WE HEARD OF NOTHING OF THE SORT BEING DONE BY OTHERS.

BE THAT AS IT MAY, THE WHOLE CROWD OF WORKPEOPLE HAD AT LAST REACHED THE OPEN SPACE IN FRONT OF THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS HOUSE AND WERE DRAWN UP THERE IN SILENCE AND GOOD ORDER. THEN, GAPING OPEN-MOUTHED AT THE FRONT DOOR, THEY WAITED. I AM TOLD THAT AS SOON AS THEY HALTED THEY TOOK OFF THEIR CAPS, THAT IS, A GOOD HALF-HOUR BEFORE THE APPEARANCE OF THE GOVERNOR, WHO, AS ILL-LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, WAS NOT AT HOME AT THE MOMENT. THE POLICE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE AT ONCE, AT FIRST INDIVIDUAL POLICEMEN AND THEN AS LARGE A CONTINGENT OF THEM AS COULD BE GATHERED TOGETHER; THEY BEGAN, OF COURSE, BY BEING MENACING, ORDERING THEM TO BREAK UP. BUT THE WORKMEN REMAINED OBSTINATELY, LIKE A FLOCK OF SHEEP AT A FENCE, AND REPLIED LACONICALLY THAT THEY HAD COME TO SEE ‚ÄÚTHE GENERAL HIMSELF‚ÄÙ; IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY WERE FIRMLY DETERMINED. THE UNNATURAL SHOUTING OF THE POLICE CEASED, AND WAS QUICKLY SUCCEEDED BY DELIBERATIONS, MYSTERIOUS WHISPERED INSTRUCTIONS, AND STERN, FUSSY PERPLEXITY, WHICH WRINKLED THE BROWS OF THE POLICE OFFICERS. THE HEAD OF THE POLICE PREFERRED TO AWAIT THE ARRIVAL OF THE ‚ÄÚGOVERNOR HIMSELF.‚ÄÙ IT WAS NOT TRUE THAT HE GALLOPED TO THE SPOT WITH THREE HORSES AT FULL SPEED, AND BEGAN HITTING OUT RIGHT AND LEFT BEFORE HE ALIGHTED FROM HIS CARRIAGE. IT‚ÄÔS TRUE THAT HE USED TO DASH ABOUT AND WAS FOND OF DASHING ABOUT AT FULL SPEED IN A CARRIAGE WITH A YELLOW BACK, AND WHILE HIS TRACE-HORSES, WHO WERE SO TRAINED TO CARRY THEIR HEADS THAT THEY LOOKED ‚ÄÚPOSITIVELY PERVERTED,‚ÄÙ GALLOPED MORE AND MORE FRANTICALLY, ROUSING THE ENTHUSIASM OF ALL THE SHOPKEEPERS IN THE BAZAAR, HE WOULD RISE UP IN THE CARRIAGE, STAND ERECT, HOLDING ON BY A STRAP WHICH HAD BEEN FIXED ON PURPOSE AT THE SIDE, AND WITH HIS RIGHT ARM EXTENDED INTO SPACE LIKE A FIGURE ON A MONUMENT, SURVEY THE TOWN MAJESTICALLY. BUT IN THE PRESENT CASE HE DID NOT USE HIS FISTS, AND THOUGH AS HE GOT OUT OF THE CARRIAGE HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM A FORCIBLE EXPRESSION, THIS WAS SIMPLY DONE TO KEEP UP HIS POPULARITY. THERE IS A STILL MORE ABSURD STORY THAT SOLDIERS WERE BROUGHT UP WITH BAYONETS, AND THAT A TELEGRAM WAS SENT FOR ARTILLERY AND COSSACKS; THOSE ARE LEGENDS WHICH ARE NOT BELIEVED NOW EVEN BY THOSE WHO INVENTED THEM. IT‚ÄÔS AN ABSURD STORY, TOO, THAT BARRELS OF WATER WERE BROUGHT FROM THE FIRE BRIGADE, AND THAT PEOPLE WERE DRENCHED WITH WATER FROM THEM. THE SIMPLE FACT IS THAT ILYA ILYITCH SHOUTED IN HIS HEAT THAT HE WOULDN‚ÄÔT LET ONE OF THEM COME DRY OUT OF THE WATER; PROBABLY THIS WAS THE FOUNDATION OF THE BARREL LEGEND WHICH GOT INTO THE COLUMNS OF THE PETERSBURG AND MOSCOW NEWSPAPERS. PROBABLY THE MOST ACCURATE VERSION WAS THAT AT FIRST ALL THE AVAILABLE POLICE FORMED A CORDON ROUND THE CROWD, AND A MESSENGER WAS SENT FOR LEMBKE, A POLICE SUPERINTENDENT, WHO DASHED OFF IN THE CARRIAGE BELONGING TO THE HEAD OF THE POLICE ON THE WAY TO SKVORESHNIKI, KNOWING THAT LEMBKE HAD GONE THERE IN HIS CARRIAGE HALF AN HOUR BEFORE.

BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I AM STILL UNABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION HOW THEY COULD AT FIRST SIGHT, FROM THE FIRST MOMENT, HAVE TRANSFORMED AN INSIGNIFICANT, THAT IS TO SAY AN ORDINARY, CROWD OF PETITIONERS, EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE SEVERAL OF THEM, INTO A REBELLION WHICH THREATENED TO SHAKE THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE STATE. WHY DID LEMBKE HIMSELF RUSH AT THAT IDEA WHEN HE ARRIVED TWENTY MINUTES AFTER THE MESSENGER? I IMAGINE (BUT AGAIN IT‚ÄÔS ONLY MY PRIVATE OPINION) THAT IT WAS TO THE INTEREST OF ILYA ILYITCH, WHO WAS A CRONY OF THE FACTORY MANAGER‚ÄÔS, TO REPRESENT THE CROWD IN THIS LIGHT TO LEMBKE, IN ORDER TO PREVENT HIM FROM GOING INTO THE CASE; AND LEMBKE HIMSELF HAD PUT THE IDEA INTO HIS HEAD. IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST TWO DAYS, HE HAD HAD TWO UNUSUAL AND MYSTERIOUS CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM. IT IS TRUE THEY WERE EXCEEDINGLY OBSCURE, BUT ILYA ILYITCH WAS ABLE TO GATHER FROM THEM THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD THOROUGHLY MADE UP HIS MIND THAT THERE WERE POLITICAL MANIFESTOES, AND THAT SHPIGULINS‚ÄÔ FACTORY HANDS WERE BEING INCITED TO A SOCIALIST RISING, AND THAT HE WAS SO PERSUADED OF IT THAT HE WOULD PERHAPS HAVE REGRETTED IT IF THE STORY HAD TURNED OUT TO BE NONSENSE. ‚ÄÚHE WANTS TO GET DISTINCTION IN PETERSBURG,‚ÄÙ OUR WILY ILYA ILYITCH THOUGHT TO HIMSELF AS HE LEFT VON LEMBKE; ‚ÄÚWELL, THAT JUST SUITS ME.‚ÄÙ

BUT I AM CONVINCED THAT POOR ANDREY ANTONOVITCH WOULD NOT HAVE DESIRED A REBELLION EVEN FOR THE SAKE OF DISTINGUISHING HIMSELF. HE WAS A MOST CONSCIENTIOUS OFFICIAL, WHO HAD LIVED IN A STATE OF INNOCENCE UP TO THE TIME OF HIS MARRIAGE. AND WAS IT HIS FAULT THAT, INSTEAD OF AN INNOCENT ALLOWANCE OF WOOD FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND AN EQUALLY INNOCENT MINNCHEN, A PRINCESS OF FORTY SUMMERS HAD RAISED HIM TO HER LEVEL? I KNOW ALMOST FOR CERTAIN THAT THE UNMISTAKABLE SYMPTOMS OF THE MENTAL CONDITION WHICH BROUGHT POOR ANDREY ANTONOVITCH TO A WELL-KNOWN ESTABLISHMENT IN SWITZERLAND, WHERE, I AM TOLD, HE IS NOW REGAINING HIS ENERGIES, WERE FIRST APPARENT ON THAT FATAL MORNING. BUT ONCE WE ADMIT THAT UNMISTAKABLE SIGNS OF SOMETHING WERE VISIBLE THAT MORNING, IT MAY WELL BE ALLOWED THAT SIMILAR SYMPTOMS MAY HAVE BEEN EVIDENT THE DAY BEFORE, THOUGH NOT SO CLEARLY. I HAPPEN TO KNOW FROM THE MOST PRIVATE SOURCES (WELL, YOU MAY ASSUME THAT YULIA MIHAILOVNA LATER ON, NOT IN TRIUMPH BUT ALMOST IN REMORSE‚ÄÎFOR A WOMAN IS INCAPABLE OF COMPLETE REMORSE‚ÄÎREVEALED PART OF IT TO ME HERSELF) THAT ANDREY ANTONOVITCH HAD GONE INTO HIS WIFE‚ÄÔS ROOM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT, PAST TWO O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE MORNING, HAD WAKED HER UP, AND HAD INSISTED ON HER LISTENING TO HIS ‚ÄÚULTIMATUM.‚ÄÙ HE DEMANDED IT SO INSISTENTLY THAT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO GET UP FROM HER BED IN INDIGNATION AND CURL-PAPERS, AND, SITTING DOWN ON A COUCH, SHE HAD TO LISTEN, THOUGH WITH SARCASTIC DISDAIN. ONLY THEN SHE GRASPED FOR THE FIRST TIME HOW FAR GONE HER ANDREY ANTONOVITCH WAS, AND WAS SECRETLY HORRIFIED. SHE OUGHT TO HAVE THOUGHT WHAT SHE WAS ABOUT AND HAVE BEEN SOFTENED, BUT SHE CONCEALED HER HORROR AND WAS MORE OBSTINATE THAN EVER. LIKE EVERY WIFE SHE HAD HER OWN METHOD OF TREATING ANDREY ANTONOVITCH, WHICH SHE HAD TRIED MORE THAN ONCE ALREADY AND WITH IT DRIVEN HIM TO FRENZY. YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS METHOD WAS THAT OF CONTEMPTUOUS SILENCE, FOR ONE HOUR, TWO, A WHOLE DAY AND ALMOST FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS‚ÄÎSILENCE WHATEVER HAPPENED, WHATEVER HE SAID, WHATEVER HE DID, EVEN IF HE HAD CLAMBERED UP TO THROW HIMSELF OUT OF A THREE-STORY WINDOW‚ÄÎA METHOD UNENDURABLE FOR A SENSITIVE MAN! WHETHER YULIA MIHAILOVNA MEANT TO PUNISH HER HUSBAND FOR HIS BLUNDERS OF THE LAST FEW DAYS AND THE JEALOUS ENVY HE, AS THE CHIEF AUTHORITY IN THE TOWN, FELT FOR HER ADMINISTRATIVE ABILITIES; WHETHER SHE WAS INDIGNANT AT HIS CRITICISM OF HER BEHAVIOUR WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND LOCAL SOCIETY GENERALLY, AND LACK OF COMPREHENSION OF HER SUBTLE AND FAR-SIGHTED POLITICAL AIMS; OR WAS ANGRY WITH HIS STUPID AND SENSELESS JEALOUSY OF PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÎHOWEVER THAT MAY HAVE BEEN, SHE MADE UP HER MIND NOT TO BE SOFTENED EVEN NOW, IN SPITE OF ITS BEING THREE O‚ÄÔCLOCK AT NIGHT, AND THOUGH ANDREY ANTONOVITCH WAS IN A STATE OF EMOTION SUCH AS SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM IN BEFORE.

PACING UP AND DOWN IN ALL DIRECTIONS OVER THE RUGS OF HER BOUDOIR, BESIDE HIMSELF, HE POURED OUT EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING, QUITE DISCONNECTEDLY, IT‚ÄÔS TRUE, BUT EVERYTHING THAT HAD BEEN RANKLING IN HIS HEART, FOR‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚIT WAS OUTRAGEOUS.‚ÄÙ HE BEGAN BY SAYING THAT HE WAS A LAUGHING-STOCK TO EVERY ONE AND ‚ÄÚWAS BEING LED BY THE NOSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCURSE THE EXPRESSION,‚ÄÙ HE SQUEALED, AT ONCE CATCHING HER SMILE, ‚ÄÚLET IT STAND, IT‚ÄÔS TRUE.‚Ä¶ NO, MADAM, THE TIME HAS COME; LET ME TELL YOU IT‚ÄÔS NOT A TIME FOR LAUGHTER AND FEMININE ARTS NOW. WE ARE NOT IN THE BOUDOIR OF A MINCING LADY, BUT LIKE TWO ABSTRACT CREATURES IN A BALLOON WHO HAVE MET TO SPEAK THE TRUTH.‚ÄÙ (HE WAS NO DOUBT CONFUSED AND COULD NOT FIND THE RIGHT WORDS FOR HIS IDEAS, HOWEVER JUST THEY WERE.) ‚ÄÚIT IS YOU, MADAM, YOU WHO HAVE DESTROYED MY HAPPY PAST. I TOOK UP THIS POST SIMPLY FOR YOUR SAKE, FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR AMBITION.‚Ä¶ YOU SMILE SARCASTICALLY? DON‚ÄÔT TRIUMPH, DON‚ÄÔT BE IN A HURRY. LET ME TELL YOU, MADAM, LET ME TELL YOU THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN EQUAL TO THIS POSITION, AND NOT ONLY THIS POSITION BUT A DOZEN POSITIONS LIKE IT, FOR I HAVE ABILITIES; BUT WITH YOU, MADAM, WITH YOU‚ÄÎIT‚ÄÔS IMPOSSIBLE, FOR WITH YOU HERE I HAVE NO ABILITIES. THERE CANNOT BE TWO CENTRES, AND YOU HAVE CREATED TWO‚ÄÎONE OF MINE AND ONE IN YOUR BOUDOIR‚ÄÎTWO CENTRES OF POWER, MADAM, BUT I WON‚ÄÔT ALLOW IT, I WON‚ÄÔT ALLOW IT! IN THE SERVICE, AS IN MARRIAGE, THERE MUST BE ONE CENTRE, TWO ARE IMPOSSIBLE.‚Ä¶ HOW HAVE YOU REPAID ME?‚ÄÙ HE WENT ON. ‚ÄÚOUR MARRIAGE HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT YOUR PROVING TO ME ALL THE TIME, EVERY HOUR, THAT I AM A NONENTITY, A FOOL, AND EVEN A RASCAL, AND I HAVE BEEN ALL THE TIME, EVERY HOUR, FORCED IN A DEGRADING WAY TO PROVE TO YOU THAT I AM NOT A NONENTITY, NOT A FOOL AT ALL, AND THAT I IMPRESS EVERY ONE WITH MY HONOURABLE CHARACTER. ISN‚ÄÔT THAT DEGRADING FOR BOTH SIDES?‚ÄÙ

AT THIS POINT HE BEGAN RAPIDLY STAMPING WITH BOTH FEET ON THE CARPET, SO THAT YULIA MIHAILOVNA WAS OBLIGED TO GET UP WITH STERN DIGNITY. HE SUBSIDED QUICKLY, BUT PASSED TO BEING PATHETIC AND BEGAN SOBBING (YES, SOBBING!), BEATING HIMSELF ON THE BREAST ALMOST FOR FIVE MINUTES, GETTING MORE AND MORE FRANTIC AT YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS PROFOUND SILENCE. AT LAST HE MADE A FATAL BLUNDER, AND LET SLIP THAT HE WAS JEALOUS OF PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. REALISING THAT HE HAD MADE AN UTTER FOOL OF HIMSELF, HE BECAME SAVAGELY FURIOUS, AND SHOUTED THAT HE ‚ÄÚWOULD NOT ALLOW THEM TO DENY GOD‚ÄÙ AND THAT HE WOULD ‚ÄÚSEND HER SALON OF IRRESPONSIBLE INFIDELS PACKING,‚ÄÙ THAT THE GOVERNOR OF A PROVINCE WAS BOUND TO BELIEVE IN GOD ‚ÄÚAND SO HIS WIFE WAS TOO,‚ÄÙ THAT HE WOULDN‚ÄÔT PUT UP WITH THESE YOUNG MEN; THAT ‚ÄÚYOU, MADAM, FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR OWN DIGNITY, OUGHT TO HAVE THOUGHT OF YOUR HUSBAND AND TO HAVE STOOD UP FOR HIS INTELLIGENCE EVEN IF HE WERE A MAN OF POOR ABILITIES (AND I‚ÄÔM BY NO MEANS A MAN OF POOR ABILITIES!), AND YET IT‚ÄÔS YOUR DOING THAT EVERY ONE HERE DESPISES ME, IT WAS YOU PUT THEM ALL UP TO IT!‚ÄÙ HE SHOUTED THAT HE WOULD ANNIHILATE THE WOMAN QUESTION, THAT HE WOULD ERADICATE EVERY TRACE OF IT, THAT TO-MORROW HE WOULD FORBID AND BREAK UP THEIR SILLY F√™TE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE GOVERNESSES (DAMN THEM!), THAT THE FIRST GOVERNESS HE CAME ACROSS TO-MORROW MORNING HE WOULD DRIVE OUT OF THE PROVINCE ‚ÄÚWITH A COSSACK! I‚ÄÔLL MAKE A POINT OF IT!‚ÄÙ HE SHRIEKED. ‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW,‚ÄÙ HE SCREAMED, ‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW THAT YOUR RASCALS ARE INCITING MEN AT THE FACTORY, AND THAT I KNOW IT? LET ME TELL YOU, I KNOW THE NAMES OF FOUR OF THESE RASCALS AND THAT I AM GOING OUT OF MY MIND, HOPELESSLY, HOPELESSLY!‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

BUT AT THIS POINT YULIA MIHAILOVNA SUDDENLY BROKE HER SILENCE AND STERNLY ANNOUNCED THAT SHE HAD LONG BEEN AWARE OF THESE CRIMINAL DESIGNS, AND THAT IT WAS ALL FOOLISHNESS, AND THAT HE HAD TAKEN IT TOO SERIOUSLY, AND THAT AS FOR THESE MISCHIEVOUS FELLOWS, SHE KNEW NOT ONLY THOSE FOUR BUT ALL OF THEM (IT WAS A LIE); BUT THAT SHE HAD NOT THE FAINTEST INTENTION OF GOING OUT OF HER MIND ON ACCOUNT OF IT, BUT, ON THE CONTRARY, HAD ALL THE MORE CONFIDENCE IN HER INTELLIGENCE AND HOPED TO BRING IT ALL TO A HARMONIOUS CONCLUSION: TO ENCOURAGE THE YOUNG PEOPLE, TO BRING THEM TO REASON, TO SHOW THEM SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY THAT THEIR DESIGNS WERE KNOWN, AND THEN TO POINT OUT TO THEM NEW AIMS FOR RATIONAL AND MORE NOBLE ACTIVITY.

OH, HOW CAN I DESCRIBE THE EFFECT OF THIS ON ANDREY ANTONOVITCH! HEARING THAT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD DUPED HIM AGAIN AND HAD MADE A FOOL OF HIM SO COARSELY, THAT HE HAD TOLD HER MUCH MORE THAN HE HAD TOLD HIM, AND SOONER THAN HIM, AND THAT PERHAPS PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS THE CHIEF INSTIGATOR OF ALL THESE CRIMINAL DESIGNS‚ÄÎHE FLEW INTO A FRENZY. ‚ÄÚSENSELESS BUT MALIGNANT WOMAN,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, SNAPPING HIS BONDS AT ONE BLOW, ‚ÄÚLET ME TELL YOU, I SHALL ARREST YOUR WORTHLESS LOVER AT ONCE, I SHALL PUT HIM IN FETTERS AND SEND HIM TO THE FORTRESS, OR‚ÄÎI SHALL JUMP OUT OF A WINDOW BEFORE YOUR EYES THIS MINUTE!‚ÄÙ

YULIA MIHAILOVNA, TURNING GREEN WITH ANGER, GREETED THIS TIRADE AT ONCE WITH A BURST OF PROLONGED, RINGING LAUGHTER, GOING OFF INTO PEALS SUCH AS ONE HEARS AT THE FRENCH THEATRE WHEN A PARISIAN ACTRESS, IMPORTED FOR A FEE OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND TO PLAY A COQUETTE, LAUGHS IN HER HUSBAND‚ÄÔS FACE FOR DARING TO BE JEALOUS OF HER.

VON LEMBKE RUSHED TO THE WINDOW, BUT SUDDENLY STOPPED AS THOUGH ROOTED TO THE SPOT, FOLDED HIS ARMS ACROSS HIS CHEST, AND, WHITE AS A CORPSE, LOOKED WITH A SINISTER GAZE AT THE LAUGHING LADY. ‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW, YULIA, DO YOU KNOW,‚ÄÙ HE SAID IN A GASPING AND SUPPLIANT VOICE, ‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW THAT EVEN I CAN DO SOMETHING?‚ÄÙ BUT AT THE RENEWED AND EVEN LOUDER LAUGHTER THAT FOLLOWED HIS LAST WORDS HE CLENCHED HIS TEETH, GROANED, AND SUDDENLY RUSHED, NOT TOWARDS THE WINDOW, BUT AT HIS SPOUSE, WITH HIS FIST RAISED! HE DID NOT BRING IT DOWN‚ÄÎNO, I REPEAT AGAIN AND AGAIN, NO; BUT IT WAS THE LAST STRAW. HE RAN TO HIS OWN ROOM, NOT KNOWING WHAT HE WAS DOING, FLUNG HIMSELF, DRESSED AS HE WAS, FACE DOWNWARDS ON HIS BED, WRAPPED HIMSELF CONVULSIVELY, HEAD AND ALL, IN THE SHEET, AND LAY SO FOR TWO HOURS‚ÄÎINCAPABLE OF SLEEP, INCAPABLE OF THOUGHT, WITH A LOAD ON HIS HEART AND BLANK, IMMOVABLE DESPAIR IN HIS SOUL. NOW AND THEN HE SHIVERED ALL OVER WITH AN AGONISING, FEVERISH TREMOR. DISCONNECTED AND IRRELEVANT THINGS KEPT COMING INTO HIS MIND: AT ONE MINUTE HE THOUGHT OF THE OLD CLOCK WHICH USED TO HANG ON HIS WALL FIFTEEN YEARS AGO IN PETERSBURG AND HAD LOST THE MINUTE-HAND; AT ANOTHER OF THE CHEERFUL CLERK, MILLEBOIS, AND HOW THEY HAD ONCE CAUGHT A SPARROW TOGETHER IN ALEXANDROVSKY PARK AND HAD LAUGHED SO THAT THEY COULD BE HEARD ALL OVER THE PARK, REMEMBERING THAT ONE OF THEM WAS ALREADY A COLLEGE ASSESSOR. I IMAGINE THAT ABOUT SEVEN IN THE MORNING HE MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP WITHOUT BEING AWARE OF IT HIMSELF, AND MUST HAVE SLEPT WITH ENJOYMENT, WITH AGREEABLE DREAMS.

WAKING ABOUT TEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK, HE JUMPED WILDLY OUT OF BED REMEMBERED EVERYTHING AT ONCE, AND SLAPPED HIMSELF ON THE HEAD; HE REFUSED HIS BREAKFAST, AND WOULD SEE NEITHER BLUM NOR THE CHIEF OF THE POLICE NOR THE CLERK WHO CAME TO REMIND HIM THAT HE WAS EXPECTED TO PRESIDE OVER A MEETING THAT MORNING; HE WOULD LISTEN TO NOTHING, AND DID NOT WANT TO UNDERSTAND. HE RAN LIKE ONE POSSESSED TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS PART OF THE HOUSE. THERE SOFYA ANTROPOVNA, AN OLD LADY OF GOOD FAMILY WHO HAD LIVED FOR YEARS WITH YULIA MIHAILOVNA, EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT HIS WIFE HAD SET OFF AT TEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK THAT MORNING WITH A LARGE COMPANY IN THREE CARRIAGES TO VARVARA PETROVNA STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS, TO SKVORESHNIKI, TO LOOK OVER THE PLACE WITH A VIEW TO THE SECOND F√™TE WHICH WAS PLANNED FOR A FORTNIGHT LATER, AND THAT THE VISIT TO-DAY HAD BEEN ARRANGED WITH VARVARA PETROVNA THREE DAYS BEFORE. OVERWHELMED WITH THIS NEWS, ANDREY ANTONOVITCH RETURNED TO HIS STUDY AND IMPULSIVELY ORDERED THE HORSES. HE COULD HARDLY WAIT FOR THEM TO BE GOT READY. HIS SOUL WAS HUNGERING FOR YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÎTO LOOK AT HER, TO BE NEAR HER FOR FIVE MINUTES; PERHAPS SHE WOULD GLANCE AT HIM, NOTICE HIM, WOULD SMILE AS BEFORE, FORGIVE HIM ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄÚO-OH! AREN‚ÄÔT THE HORSES READY?‚ÄÙ MECHANICALLY HE OPENED A THICK BOOK LYING ON THE TABLE. (HE SOMETIMES USED TO TRY HIS FORTUNE IN THIS WAY WITH A BOOK, OPENING IT AT RANDOM AND READING THE THREE LINES AT THE TOP OF THE RIGHT-HAND PAGE.) WHAT TURNED UP WAS: ‚ÄÚTOUT EST POUR LE MIEUX DANS LE MEILLEUR DES MONDES POSSIBLES.‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎVOLTAIRE, CANDIDE. HE UTTERED AN EJACULATION OF CONTEMPT AND RAN TO GET INTO THE CARRIAGE. ‚ÄÚSKVORESHNIKI!‚ÄÙ

THE COACHMAN SAID AFTERWARDS THAT HIS MASTER URGED HIM ON ALL THE WAY, BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE GETTING NEAR THE MANSION HE SUDDENLY TOLD HIM TO TURN AND DRIVE BACK TO THE TOWN, BIDDING HIM ‚ÄÚDRIVE FAST; PLEASE DRIVE FAST!‚ÄÙ BEFORE THEY REACHED THE TOWN WALL ‚ÄÚMASTER TOLD ME TO STOP AGAIN, GOT OUT OF THE CARRIAGE, AND WENT ACROSS THE ROAD INTO THE FIELD; I THOUGHT HE FELT ILL BUT HE STOPPED AND BEGAN LOOKING AT THE FLOWERS, AND SO HE STOOD FOR A TIME. IT WAS STRANGE, REALLY; I BEGAN TO FEEL QUITE UNEASY.‚ÄÙ THIS WAS THE COACHMAN‚ÄÔS TESTIMONY. I REMEMBER THE WEATHER THAT MORNING: IT WAS A COLD, CLEAR, BUT WINDY SEPTEMBER DAY; BEFORE ANDREY ANTONOVITCH STRETCHED A FORBIDDING LANDSCAPE OF BARE FIELDS FROM WHICH THE CROP HAD LONG BEEN HARVESTED; THERE WERE A FEW DYING YELLOW FLOWERS, PITIFUL RELICS BLOWN ABOUT BY THE HOWLING WIND. DID HE WANT TO COMPARE HIMSELF AND HIS FATE WITH THOSE WRETCHED FLOWERS BATTERED BY THE AUTUMN AND THE FROST? I DON‚ÄÔT THINK SO; IN FACT I FEEL SURE IT WAS NOT SO, AND THAT HE REALISED NOTHING ABOUT THE FLOWERS IN SPITE OF THE EVIDENCE OF THE COACHMAN AND OF THE POLICE SUPERINTENDENT, WHO DROVE UP AT THAT MOMENT AND ASSERTED AFTERWARDS THAT HE FOUND THE GOVERNOR WITH A BUNCH OF YELLOW FLOWERS IN HIS HAND. THIS POLICE SUPERINTENDENT, FLIBUSTEROV BY NAME, WAS AN ARDENT CHAMPION OF AUTHORITY WHO HAD ONLY RECENTLY COME TO OUR TOWN BUT HAD ALREADY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AND BECOME FAMOUS BY HIS INORDINATE ZEAL, BY A CERTAIN VEHEMENCE IN THE EXECUTION OF HIS DUTIES, AND HIS INVETERATE INEBRIETY. JUMPING OUT OF THE CARRIAGE, AND NOT THE LEAST DISCONCERTED AT THE SIGHT OF WHAT THE GOVERNOR WAS DOING, HE BLURTED OUT ALL IN ONE BREATH, WITH A FRANTIC EXPRESSION, YET WITH AN AIR OF CONVICTION, THAT ‚ÄÚTHERE‚ÄÔS AN UPSET IN THE TOWN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEH? WHAT?‚ÄÙ SAID ANDREY ANTONOVITCH, TURNING TO HIM WITH A STERN FACE, BUT WITHOUT A TRACE OF SURPRISE OR ANY RECOLLECTION OF HIS CARRIAGE AND HIS COACHMAN, AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN IN HIS OWN STUDY.

‚ÄÚPOLICE-SUPERINTENDENT FLIBUSTEROV, YOUR EXCELLENCY. THERE‚ÄÔS A RIOT IN THE TOWN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFILIBUSTERS?‚ÄÙ ANDREY ANTONOVITCH SAID THOUGHTFULLY.

‚ÄÚJUST SO, YOUR EXCELLENCY. THE SHPIGULIN MEN ARE MAKING A RIOT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE SHPIGULIN MEN!‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

THE NAME ‚ÄÚSHPIGULIN‚ÄÙ SEEMED TO REMIND HIM OF SOMETHING. HE STARTED AND PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS FOREHEAD: ‚ÄÚTHE SHPIGULIN MEN!‚ÄÙ IN SILENCE, AND STILL PLUNGED IN THOUGHT, HE WALKED WITHOUT HASTE TO THE CARRIAGE, TOOK HIS SEAT, AND TOLD THE COACHMAN TO DRIVE TO THE TOWN. THE POLICE-SUPERINTENDENT FOLLOWED IN THE DROSHKY.

I IMAGINE THAT HE HAD VAGUE IMPRESSIONS OF MANY INTERESTING THINGS OF ALL SORTS ON THE WAY, BUT I DOUBT WHETHER HE HAD ANY DEFINITE IDEA OR ANY SETTLED INTENTION AS HE DROVE INTO THE OPEN SPACE IN FRONT OF HIS HOUSE. BUT NO SOONER DID HE SEE THE RESOLUTE AND ORDERLY RANKS OF ‚ÄÚTHE RIOTERS,‚ÄÙ THE CORDON OF POLICE, THE HELPLESS (AND PERHAPS PURPOSELY HELPLESS) CHIEF OF POLICE, AND THE GENERAL EXPECTATION OF WHICH HE WAS THE OBJECT, THAN ALL THE BLOOD RUSHED TO HIS HEART. WITH A PALE FACE HE STEPPED OUT OF HIS CARRIAGE.

‚ÄÚCAPS OFF!‚ÄÙ HE SAID BREATHLESSLY AND HARDLY AUDIBLY. ‚ÄÚON YOUR KNEES!‚ÄÙ HE SQUEALED, TO THE SURPRISE OF EVERY ONE, TO HIS OWN SURPRISE TOO, AND PERHAPS THE VERY UNEXPECTEDNESS OF THE POSITION WAS THE EXPLANATION OF WHAT FOLLOWED. CAN A SLEDGE ON A SWITCHBACK AT CARNIVAL STOP SHORT AS IT FLIES DOWN THE HILL? WHAT MADE IT WORSE, ANDREY ANTONOVITCH HAD BEEN ALL HIS LIFE SERENE IN CHARACTER, AND NEVER SHOUTED OR STAMPED AT ANYONE; AND SUCH PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS THE MOST DANGEROUS IF IT ONCE HAPPENS THAT SOMETHING SETS THEIR SLEDGE SLIDING DOWNHILL. EVERYTHING WAS WHIRLING BEFORE HIS EYES.

‚ÄÚFILIBUSTERS!‚ÄÙ HE YELLED STILL MORE SHRILLY AND ABSURDLY, AND HIS VOICE BROKE. HE STOOD, NOT KNOWING WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO, BUT KNOWING AND FEELING IN HIS WHOLE BEING THAT HE CERTAINLY WOULD DO SOMETHING DIRECTLY.

‚ÄÚLORD!‚ÄÙ WAS HEARD FROM THE CROWD. A LAD BEGAN CROSSING HIMSELF; THREE OR FOUR MEN ACTUALLY DID TRY TO KNEEL DOWN, BUT THE WHOLE MASS MOVED THREE STEPS FORWARD, AND SUDDENLY ALL BEGAN TALKING AT ONCE: ‚ÄÚYOUR EXCELLENCY ‚Ä¶ WE WERE HIRED FOR A TERM ‚Ä¶ THE MANAGER ‚Ä¶ YOU MUSTN‚ÄÔT SAY,‚ÄÙ AND SO ON AND SO ON. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH ANYTHING.

ALAS! ANDREY ANTONOVITCH COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING: THE FLOWERS WERE STILL IN HIS HANDS. THE RIOT WAS AS REAL TO HIM AS THE PRISON CARTS WERE TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. AND FLITTING TO AND FRO IN THE CROWD OF ‚ÄÚRIOTERS‚ÄÙ WHO GAZED OPEN-EYED AT HIM, HE SEEMED TO SEE PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WHO HAD EGGED THEM ON‚ÄÎPYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WHOM HE HATED AND WHOSE IMAGE HAD NEVER LEFT HIM SINCE YESTERDAY.

‚ÄÚRODS!‚ÄÙ HE CRIED EVEN MORE UNEXPECTEDLY. A DEAD SILENCE FOLLOWED.

FROM THE FACTS I HAVE LEARNT AND THOSE I HAVE CONJECTURED, THIS MUST HAVE BEEN WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BEGINNING; BUT I HAVE NO SUCH EXACT INFORMATION FOR WHAT FOLLOWED, NOR CAN I CONJECTURE IT SO EASILY. THERE ARE SOME FACTS, HOWEVER.

IN THE FIRST PLACE, RODS WERE BROUGHT ON THE SCENE WITH STRANGE RAPIDITY; THEY HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN GOT READY BEFOREHAND IN EXPECTATION BY THE INTELLIGENT CHIEF OF THE POLICE. NOT MORE THAN TWO, OR AT MOST THREE, WERE ACTUALLY FLOGGED, HOWEVER; THAT FACT I WISH TO LAY STRESS ON. IT‚ÄÔS AN ABSOLUTE FABRICATION TO SAY THAT THE WHOLE CROWD OF RIOTERS, OR AT LEAST HALF OF THEM, WERE PUNISHED. IT IS A NONSENSICAL STORY, TOO, THAT A POOR BUT RESPECTABLE LADY WAS CAUGHT AS SHE PASSED BY AND PROMPTLY THRASHED; YET I READ MYSELF AN ACCOUNT OF THIS INCIDENT AFTERWARDS AMONG THE PROVINCIAL ITEMS OF A PETERSBURG NEWSPAPER. MANY PEOPLE IN THE TOWN TALKED OF AN OLD WOMAN CALLED AVDOTYA PETROVNA TARAPYGIN WHO LIVED IN THE ALMSHOUSE BY THE CEMETERY. SHE WAS SAID, ON HER WAY HOME FROM VISITING A FRIEND, TO HAVE FORCED HER WAY INTO THE CROWD OF SPECTATORS THROUGH NATURAL CURIOSITY. SEEING WHAT WAS GOING ON, SHE CRIED OUT, ‚ÄÚWHAT A SHAME!‚ÄÙ AND SPAT ON THE GROUND. FOR THIS IT WAS SAID SHE HAD BEEN SEIZED AND FLOGGED TOO. THIS STORY NOT ONLY APPEARED IN PRINT, BUT IN OUR EXCITEMENT WE POSITIVELY GOT UP A SUBSCRIPTION FOR HER BENEFIT. I SUBSCRIBED TWENTY KOPECKS MYSELF. AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT? IT APPEARS NOW THAT THERE WAS NO OLD WOMAN CALLED TARAPYGIN LIVING IN THE ALMSHOUSE AT ALL! I WENT TO INQUIRE AT THE ALMSHOUSE BY THE CEMETERY MYSELF; THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE CALLED TARAPYGIN THERE, AND, WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, THEY WERE QUITE OFFENDED WHEN I TOLD THEM THE STORY THAT WAS GOING ROUND. I MENTION THIS FABULOUS AVDOTYA PETROVNA BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED TO HER (IF SHE REALLY HAD EXISTED) VERY NEARLY HAPPENED TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. POSSIBLY, INDEED, HIS ADVENTURE MAY HAVE BEEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RIDICULOUS TALE ABOUT THE OLD WOMAN, THAT IS, AS THE GOSSIP WENT ON GROWING HE WAS TRANSFORMED INTO THIS OLD DAME.

WHAT I FIND MOST DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND IS HOW HE CAME TO SLIP AWAY FROM ME AS SOON AS HE GOT INTO THE SQUARE. AS I HAD A MISGIVING OF SOMETHING VERY UNPLEASANT, I WANTED TO TAKE HIM ROUND THE SQUARE STRAIGHT TO THE ENTRANCE TO THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS, BUT MY OWN CURIOSITY WAS ROUSED, AND I STOPPED ONLY FOR ONE MINUTE TO QUESTION THE FIRST PERSON I CAME ACROSS, AND SUDDENLY I LOOKED ROUND AND FOUND STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH NO LONGER AT MY SIDE. INSTINCTIVELY I DARTED OFF TO LOOK FOR HIM IN THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACE; SOMETHING MADE ME FEEL THAT HIS SLEDGE, TOO, WAS FLYING DOWNHILL. AND I DID, AS A FACT, FIND HIM IN THE VERY CENTRE OF THINGS. I REMEMBER I SEIZED HIM BY THE ARM; BUT HE LOOKED QUIETLY AND PROUDLY AT ME WITH AN AIR OF IMMENSE AUTHORITY.

‚ÄÚCHER,‚ÄÙ HE PRONOUNCED IN A VOICE WHICH QUIVERED ON A BREAKING NOTE, ‚ÄÚIF THEY ARE DEALING WITH PEOPLE SO UNCEREMONIOUSLY BEFORE US, IN AN OPEN SQUARE, WHAT IS TO BE EXPECTED FROM THAT MAN, FOR INSTANCE ‚Ä¶ IF HE HAPPENS TO ACT ON HIS OWN AUTHORITY?‚ÄÙ

AND SHAKING WITH INDIGNATION AND WITH AN INTENSE DESIRE TO DEFY THEM, HE POINTED A MENACING, ACCUSING FINGER AT FLIBUSTEROV, WHO WAS GAZING AT US OPEN-EYED TWO PACES AWAY.

‚ÄÚTHAT MAN!‚ÄÙ CRIED THE LATTER, BLIND WITH RAGE. ‚ÄÚWHAT MAN? AND WHO ARE YOU?‚ÄÙ HE STEPPED UP TO HIM, CLENCHING HIS FIST. ‚ÄÚWHO ARE YOU?‚ÄÙ HE ROARED FEROCIOUSLY, HYSTERICALLY, AND DESPERATELY. (I MUST MENTION THAT HE KNEW STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH PERFECTLY WELL BY SIGHT.) ANOTHER MOMENT AND HE WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY SEIZED HIM BY THE COLLAR; BUT LUCKILY, HEARING HIM SHOUT, LEMBKE TURNED HIS HEAD. HE GAZED INTENSELY BUT WITH PERPLEXITY AT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, SEEMING TO CONSIDER SOMETHING, AND SUDDENLY HE SHOOK HIS HAND IMPATIENTLY. FLIBUSTEROV WAS CHECKED. I DREW STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH OUT OF THE CROWD, THOUGH PERHAPS HE MAY HAVE WISHED TO RETREAT HIMSELF.

‚ÄÚHOME, HOME,‚ÄÙ I INSISTED; ‚ÄÚIT WAS CERTAINLY THANKS TO LEMBKE THAT WE WERE NOT BEATEN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGO, MY FRIEND; I AM TO BLAME FOR EXPOSING YOU TO THIS. YOU HAVE A FUTURE AND A CAREER OF A SORT BEFORE YOU, WHILE I‚ÄÎMON HEURE EST SONN√©E.‚ÄÙ

HE RESOLUTELY MOUNTED THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS STEPS. THE HALL-PORTER KNEW ME; I SAID THAT WE BOTH WANTED TO SEE YULIA MIHAILOVNA.

WE SAT DOWN IN THE WAITING-ROOM AND WAITED. I WAS UNWILLING TO LEAVE MY FRIEND, BUT I THOUGHT IT UNNECESSARY TO SAY ANYTHING MORE TO HIM. HE HAD THE AIR OF A MAN WHO HAD CONSECRATED HIMSELF TO CERTAIN DEATH FOR THE SAKE OF HIS COUNTRY. WE SAT DOWN, NOT SIDE BY SIDE, BUT IN DIFFERENT CORNERS‚ÄÎI NEARER TO THE ENTRANCE, HE AT SOME DISTANCE FACING ME, WITH HIS HEAD BENT IN THOUGHT, LEANING LIGHTLY ON HIS STICK. HE HELD HIS WIDE-BRIMMED HAT IN HIS LEFT HAND. WE SAT LIKE THAT FOR TEN MINUTES.

II

LEMBKE SUDDENLY CAME IN WITH RAPID STEPS, ACCOMPANIED BY THE CHIEF OF POLICE, LOOKED ABSENT-MINDEDLY AT US AND, TAKING NO NOTICE OF US, WAS ABOUT TO PASS INTO HIS STUDY ON THE RIGHT, BUT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH STOOD BEFORE HIM BLOCKING HIS WAY. THE TALL FIGURE OF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, SO UNLIKE OTHER PEOPLE, MADE AN IMPRESSION. LEMBKE STOPPED.

‚ÄÚWHO IS THIS?‚ÄÙ HE MUTTERED, PUZZLED, AS IF HE WERE QUESTIONING THE CHIEF OF POLICE, THOUGH HE DID NOT TURN HIS HEAD TOWARDS HIM, AND WAS ALL THE TIME GAZING AT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.

‚ÄÚRETIRED COLLEGE ASSESSOR, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH VERHOVENSKY, YOUR EXCELLENCY,‚ÄÙ ANSWERED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, BOWING MAJESTICALLY. HIS EXCELLENCY WENT ON STARING AT HIM WITH A VERY BLANK EXPRESSION, HOWEVER.

‚ÄÚWHAT IS IT?‚ÄÙ AND WITH THE CURTNESS OF A GREAT OFFICIAL HE TURNED HIS EAR TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WITH DISDAINFUL IMPATIENCE, TAKING HIM FOR AN ORDINARY PERSON WITH A WRITTEN PETITION OF SOME SORT.

‚ÄÚI WAS VISITED AND MY HOUSE WAS SEARCHED TO-DAY BY AN OFFICIAL ACTING IN YOUR EXCELLENCY‚ÄÔS NAME; THEREFORE I AM DESIROUS ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNAME? NAME?‚ÄÙ LEMBKE ASKED IMPATIENTLY, SEEMING SUDDENLY TO HAVE AN INKLING OF SOMETHING. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH REPEATED HIS NAME STILL MORE MAJESTICALLY.

‚ÄÚA-A-AH! IT‚ÄÔS ‚Ä¶ THAT HOTBED ‚Ä¶ YOU HAVE SHOWN YOURSELF, SIR, IN SUCH A LIGHT.‚Ä¶ ARE YOU A PROFESSOR? A PROFESSOR?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI ONCE HAD THE HONOUR OF GIVING SOME LECTURES TO THE YOUNG MEN OF THE X UNIVERSITY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE YOUNG MEN!‚ÄÙ LEMBKE SEEMED TO START, THOUGH I AM READY TO BET THAT HE GRASPED VERY LITTLE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON OR EVEN, PERHAPS, DID NOT KNOW WITH WHOM HE WAS TALKING.

‚ÄÚTHAT, SIR, I WON‚ÄÔT ALLOW,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, SUDDENLY GETTING TERRIBLY ANGRY. ‚ÄÚI WON‚ÄÔT ALLOW YOUNG MEN! IT‚ÄÔS ALL THESE MANIFESTOES? IT‚ÄÔS AN ASSAULT ON SOCIETY, SIR, A PIRATICAL ATTACK, FILIBUSTERING.‚Ä¶ WHAT IS YOUR REQUEST?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚON THE CONTRARY, YOUR WIFE REQUESTED ME TO READ SOMETHING TO-MORROW AT HER F√™TE. I‚ÄÔVE NOT COME TO MAKE A REQUEST BUT TO ASK FOR MY RIGHTS‚Ä¶.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAT THE F√™TE? THERE‚ÄÔLL BE NO F√™TE. I WON‚ÄÔT ALLOW YOUR F√™TE. A LECTURE? A LECTURE?‚ÄÙ HE SCREAMED FURIOUSLY.

‚ÄÚI SHOULD BE VERY GLAD IF YOU WOULD SPEAK TO ME RATHER MORE POLITELY, YOUR EXCELLENCY, WITHOUT STAMPING OR SHOUTING AT ME AS THOUGH I WERE A BOY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPERHAPS YOU UNDERSTAND WHOM YOU ARE SPEAKING TO?‚ÄÙ SAID LEMBKE, TURNING CRIMSON.

‚ÄÚPERFECTLY, YOUR EXCELLENCY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM PROTECTING SOCIETY WHILE YOU ARE DESTROYING IT!‚Ä¶ YOU ‚Ä¶ I REMEMBER ABOUT YOU, THOUGH: YOU USED TO BE A TUTOR IN THE HOUSE OF MADAME STAVROGIN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, I WAS IN THE POSITION ‚Ä¶ OF TUTOR ‚Ä¶ IN THE HOUSE OF MADAME STAVROGIN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND HAVE BEEN FOR TWENTY YEARS THE HOTBED OF ALL THAT HAS NOW ACCUMULATED ‚Ä¶ ALL THE FRUITS.‚Ä¶ I BELIEVE I SAW YOU JUST NOW IN THE SQUARE. YOU‚ÄÔD BETTER LOOK OUT, SIR, YOU‚ÄÔD BETTER LOOK OUT; YOUR WAY OF THINKING IS WELL KNOWN. YOU MAY BE SURE THAT I KEEP MY EYE ON YOU. I CANNOT ALLOW YOUR LECTURES, SIR, I CANNOT. DON‚ÄÔT COME WITH SUCH REQUESTS TO ME.‚ÄÙ

HE WOULD HAVE PASSED ON AGAIN.

‚ÄÚI REPEAT THAT YOUR EXCELLENCY IS MISTAKEN; IT WAS YOUR WIFE WHO ASKED ME TO GIVE, NOT A LECTURE, BUT A LITERARY READING AT THE F√™TE TO-MORROW. BUT I DECLINE TO DO SO IN ANY CASE NOW. I HUMBLY REQUEST THAT YOU WILL EXPLAIN TO ME IF POSSIBLE HOW, WHY, AND FOR WHAT REASON I WAS SUBJECTED TO AN OFFICIAL SEARCH TO-DAY? SOME OF MY BOOKS AND PAPERS, PRIVATE LETTERS TO ME, WERE TAKEN FROM ME AND WHEELED THROUGH THE TOWN IN A BARROW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHO SEARCHED YOU?‚ÄÙ SAID LEMBKE, STARTING AND RETURNING TO FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE POSITION. HE SUDDENLY FLUSHED ALL OVER. HE TURNED QUICKLY TO THE CHIEF OF POLICE. AT THAT MOMENT THE LONG, STOOPING, AND AWKWARD FIGURE OF BLUM APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY.

‚ÄÚWHY, THIS OFFICIAL HERE,‚ÄÙ SAID STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, INDICATING HIM. BLUM CAME FORWARD WITH A FACE THAT ADMITTED HIS RESPONSIBILITY BUT SHOWED NO CONTRITION.

‚ÄÚVOUS NE FAITES QUE DES B√™TISES,‚ÄÙ LEMBKE THREW AT HIM IN A TONE OF VEXATION AND ANGER, AND SUDDENLY HE WAS TRANSFORMED AND COMPLETELY HIMSELF AGAIN.

‚ÄÚEXCUSE ME,‚ÄÙ HE MUTTERED, UTTERLY DISCONCERTED AND TURNING ABSOLUTELY CRIMSON, ‚ÄÚALL THIS ‚Ä¶ ALL THIS WAS PROBABLY A MERE BLUNDER, A MISUNDERSTANDING ‚Ä¶ NOTHING BUT A MISUNDERSTANDING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOUR EXCELLENCY,‚ÄÙ OBSERVED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, ‚ÄÚONCE WHEN I WAS YOUNG I SAW A CHARACTERISTIC INCIDENT. IN THE CORRIDOR OF A THEATRE A MAN RAN UP TO ANOTHER AND GAVE HIM A SOUNDING SMACK IN THE FACE BEFORE THE WHOLE PUBLIC. PERCEIVING AT ONCE THAT HIS VICTIM WAS NOT THE PERSON WHOM HE HAD INTENDED TO CHASTISE BUT SOMEONE QUITE DIFFERENT WHO ONLY SLIGHTLY RESEMBLED HIM, HE PRONOUNCED ANGRILY, WITH THE HASTE OF ONE WHOSE MOMENTS ARE PRECIOUS‚ÄÎAS YOUR EXCELLENCY DID JUST NOW‚ÄÎ‚ÄÒI‚ÄÔVE MADE A MISTAKE ‚Ä¶ EXCUSE ME, IT WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING, NOTHING BUT A MISUNDERSTANDING.‚ÄÔ AND WHEN THE OFFENDED MAN REMAINED RESENTFUL AND CRIED OUT, HE OBSERVED TO HIM, WITH EXTREME ANNOYANCE: ‚ÄÒWHY, I TELL YOU IT WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING. WHAT ARE YOU CRYING OUT ABOUT?‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS ‚Ä¶ THAT‚ÄÔS VERY AMUSING, OF COURSE‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎLEMBKE GAVE A WRY SMILE‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚBUT ‚Ä¶ BUT CAN‚ÄÔT YOU SEE HOW UNHAPPY I AM MYSELF?‚ÄÙ

HE ALMOST SCREAMED, AND SEEMED ABOUT TO HIDE HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS.

THIS UNEXPECTED AND PITEOUS EXCLAMATION, ALMOST A SOB, WAS ALMOST MORE THAN ONE COULD BEAR. IT WAS PROBABLY THE FIRST MOMENT SINCE THE PREVIOUS DAY THAT HE HAD FULL, VIVID CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED‚ÄÎAND IT WAS FOLLOWED BY COMPLETE, HUMILIATING DESPAIR THAT COULD NOT BE DISGUISED‚ÄÎWHO KNOWS, IN ANOTHER MINUTE HE MIGHT HAVE SOBBED ALOUD. FOR THE FIRST MOMENT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH LOOKED WILDLY AT HIM; THEN HE SUDDENLY BOWED HIS HEAD AND IN A VOICE PREGNANT WITH FEELING PRONOUNCED:

‚ÄÚYOUR EXCELLENCY, DON‚ÄÔT TROUBLE YOURSELF WITH MY PETULANT COMPLAINT, AND ONLY GIVE ORDERS FOR MY BOOKS AND LETTERS TO BE RESTORED TO ME.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

HE WAS INTERRUPTED. AT THAT VERY INSTANT YULIA MIHAILOVNA RETURNED AND ENTERED NOISILY WITH ALL THE PARTY WHICH HAD ACCOMPANIED HER. BUT AT THIS POINT I SHOULD LIKE TO TELL MY STORY IN AS MUCH DETAIL AS POSSIBLE.

III

IN THE FIRST PLACE, THE WHOLE COMPANY WHO HAD FILLED THREE CARRIAGES CROWDED INTO THE WAITING-ROOM. THERE WAS A SPECIAL ENTRANCE TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS APARTMENTS ON THE LEFT AS ONE ENTERED THE HOUSE; BUT ON THIS OCCASION THEY ALL WENT THROUGH THE WAITING-ROOM‚ÄÎAND I IMAGINE JUST BECAUSE STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS THERE, AND BECAUSE ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AS WELL AS THE SHPIGULIN AFFAIR HAD REACHED YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS EARS AS SHE DROVE INTO THE TOWN. LYAMSHIN, WHO FOR SOME MISDEMEANOUR HAD NOT BEEN INVITED TO JOIN THE PARTY AND SO KNEW ALL THAT HAD BEEN HAPPENING IN THE TOWN BEFORE ANYONE ELSE, BROUGHT HER THE NEWS. WITH SPITEFUL GLEE HE HIRED A WRETCHED COSSACK NAG AND HASTENED ON THE WAY TO SKVORESHNIKI TO MEET THE RETURNING CAVALCADE WITH THE DIVERTING INTELLIGENCE. I FANCY THAT, IN SPITE OF HER LOFTY DETERMINATION, YULIA MIHAILOVNA WAS A LITTLE DISCONCERTED ON HEARING SUCH SURPRISING NEWS, BUT PROBABLY ONLY FOR AN INSTANT. THE POLITICAL ASPECT OF THE AFFAIR, FOR INSTANCE, COULD NOT CAUSE HER UNEASINESS; PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD IMPRESSED UPON HER THREE OR FOUR TIMES THAT THE SHPIGULIN RUFFIANS OUGHT TO BE FLOGGED, AND PYOTR STEPANOVITCH CERTAINLY HAD FOR SOME TIME PAST BEEN A GREAT AUTHORITY IN HER EYES. ‚ÄÚBUT ‚Ä¶ ANYWAY, I SHALL MAKE HIM PAY FOR IT,‚ÄÙ SHE DOUBTLESS REFLECTED, THE ‚ÄÚHE,‚ÄÙ OF COURSE, REFERRING TO HER SPOUSE. I MUST OBSERVE IN PASSING THAT ON THIS OCCASION, AS THOUGH PURPOSELY, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD TAKEN NO PART IN THE EXPEDITION, AND NO ONE HAD SEEN HIM ALL DAY. I MUST MENTION TOO, BY THE WAY, THAT VARVARA PETROVNA HAD COME BACK TO THE TOWN WITH HER GUESTS (IN THE SAME CARRIAGE WITH YULIA MIHAILOVNA) IN ORDER TO BE PRESENT AT THE LAST MEETING OF THE COMMITTEE WHICH WAS ARRANGING THE F√™TE FOR THE NEXT DAY. SHE TOO MUST HAVE BEEN INTERESTED, AND PERHAPS EVEN AGITATED, BY THE NEWS ABOUT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH COMMUNICATED BY LYAMSHIN.

THE HOUR OF RECKONING FOR ANDREY ANTONOVITCH FOLLOWED AT ONCE. ALAS! HE FELT THAT FROM THE FIRST GLANCE AT HIS ADMIRABLE WIFE. WITH AN OPEN AIR AND AN ENCHANTING SMILE SHE WENT QUICKLY UP TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, HELD OUT HER EXQUISITELY GLOVED HAND, AND GREETED HIM WITH A PERFECT SHOWER OF FLATTERING PHRASES‚ÄÎAS THOUGH THE ONLY THING SHE CARED ABOUT THAT MORNING WAS TO MAKE HASTE TO BE CHARMING TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH BECAUSE AT LAST SHE SAW HIM IN HER HOUSE. THERE WAS NOT ONE HINT OF THE SEARCH THAT MORNING; IT WAS AS THOUGH SHE KNEW NOTHING OF IT. THERE WAS NOT ONE WORD TO HER HUSBAND, NOT ONE GLANCE IN HIS DIRECTION‚ÄÎAS THOUGH HE HAD NOT BEEN IN THE ROOM. WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, SHE PROMPTLY CONFISCATED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH AND CARRIED HIM OFF TO THE DRAWING-ROOM‚ÄÎAS THOUGH HE HAD HAD NO INTERVIEW WITH LEMBKE, OR AS THOUGH IT WAS NOT WORTH PROLONGING IF HE HAD. I REPEAT AGAIN, I THINK THAT IN THIS, YULIA MIHAILOVNA, IN SPITE OF HER ARISTOCRATIC TONE, MADE ANOTHER GREAT MISTAKE. AND KARMAZINOV PARTICULARLY DID MUCH TO AGGRAVATE THIS. (HE HAD TAKEN PART IN THE EXPEDITION AT YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS SPECIAL REQUEST, AND IN THAT WAY HAD, INCIDENTALLY, PAID HIS VISIT TO VARVARA PETROVNA, AND SHE WAS SO POOR-SPIRITED AS TO BE PERFECTLY DELIGHTED AT IT.) ON SEEING STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, HE CALLED OUT FROM THE DOORWAY (HE CAME IN BEHIND THE REST) AND PRESSED FORWARD TO EMBRACE HIM, EVEN INTERRUPTING YULIA MIHAILOVNA.

‚ÄÚWHAT YEARS, WHAT AGES! AT LAST ‚Ä¶ EXCELLENT AMI.‚ÄÙ

HE MADE AS THOUGH TO KISS HIM, OFFERING HIS CHEEK, OF COURSE, AND STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS SO FLUTTERED THAT HE COULD NOT AVOID SALUTING IT.

‚ÄÚCHER,‚ÄÙ HE SAID TO ME THAT EVENING, RECALLING ALL THE EVENTS OF THAT DAY, ‚ÄÚI WONDERED AT THAT MOMENT WHICH OF US WAS THE MOST CONTEMPTIBLE: HE, EMBRACING ME ONLY TO HUMILIATE ME, OR I, DESPISING HIM AND HIS FACE AND KISSING IT ON THE SPOT, THOUGH I MIGHT HAVE TURNED AWAY.‚Ä¶ FOO!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCOME, TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF, TELL ME EVERYTHING,‚ÄÙ KARMAZINOV DRAWLED AND LISPED, AS THOUGH IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR HIM ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF HIS LIFE. BUT THIS FOOLISH TRIFLING WAS THE HEIGHT OF ‚ÄÚCHIC.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚREMEMBER THAT THE LAST TIME WE MET WAS AT THE GRANOVSKY DINNER IN MOSCOW, AND THAT TWENTY-FOUR YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH BEGAN VERY REASONABLY (AND CONSEQUENTLY NOT AT ALL IN THE SAME ‚ÄÚCHIC‚ÄÙ STYLE).

‚ÄÚCE CHER HOMME,‚ÄÙ KARMAZINOV INTERRUPTED WITH SHRILL FAMILIARITY, SQUEEZING HIS SHOULDER WITH EXAGGERATED FRIENDLINESS. ‚ÄÚMAKE HASTE AND TAKE US TO YOUR ROOM, YULIA MIHAILOVNA; THERE HE‚ÄÔLL SIT DOWN AND TELL US EVERYTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND YET I WAS NEVER AT ALL INTIMATE WITH THAT PEEVISH OLD WOMAN,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WENT ON COMPLAINING TO ME THAT SAME EVENING, SHAKING WITH ANGER; ‚ÄÚWE WERE ALMOST BOYS, AND I‚ÄÔD BEGUN TO DETEST HIM EVEN THEN ‚Ä¶ JUST AS HE HAD ME, OF COURSE.‚ÄÙ

YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS DRAWING-ROOM FILLED UP QUICKLY. VARVARA PETROVNA WAS PARTICULARLY EXCITED, THOUGH SHE TRIED TO APPEAR INDIFFERENT, BUT I CAUGHT HER ONCE OR TWICE GLANCING WITH HATRED AT KARMAZINOV AND WITH WRATH AT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÎTHE WRATH OF ANTICIPATION, THE WRATH OF JEALOUSY AND LOVE: IF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HAD BLUNDERED THIS TIME AND HAD LET KARMAZINOV MAKE HIM LOOK SMALL BEFORE EVERY ONE, I BELIEVE SHE WOULD HAVE LEAPT UP AND BEATEN HIM. I HAVE FORGOTTEN TO SAY THAT LIZA TOO WAS THERE, AND I HAD NEVER SEEN HER MORE RADIANT, CARELESSLY LIGHT-HEARTED, AND HAPPY. MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH WAS THERE TOO, OF COURSE. IN THE CROWD OF YOUNG LADIES AND RATHER VULGAR YOUNG MEN WHO MADE UP YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS USUAL RETINUE, AND AMONG WHOM THIS VULGARITY WAS TAKEN FOR SPRIGHTLINESS, AND CHEAP CYNICISM FOR WIT, I NOTICED TWO OR THREE NEW FACES: A VERY OBSEQUIOUS POLE WHO WAS ON A VISIT IN THE TOWN; A GERMAN DOCTOR, A STURDY OLD FELLOW WHO KEPT LOUDLY LAUGHING WITH GREAT ZEST AT HIS OWN WIT; AND LASTLY, A VERY YOUNG PRINCELING FROM PETERSBURG LIKE AN AUTOMATON FIGURE, WITH THE DEPORTMENT OF A STATE DIGNITARY AND A FEARFULLY HIGH COLLAR. BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT YULIA MIHAILOVNA HAD A VERY HIGH OPINION OF THIS VISITOR, AND WAS EVEN A LITTLE ANXIOUS OF THE IMPRESSION HER SALON WAS MAKING ON HIM.

‚ÄÚCHER M. KARMAZINOV,‚ÄÙ SAID STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, SITTING IN A PICTURESQUE POSE ON THE SOFA AND SUDDENLY BEGINNING TO LISP AS DAINTILY AS KARMAZINOV HIMSELF, ‚ÄÚCHER M. KARMAZINOV, THE LIFE OF A MAN OF OUR TIME AND OF CERTAIN CONVICTIONS, EVEN AFTER AN INTERVAL OF TWENTY-FIVE YEARS, IS BOUND TO SEEM MONOTONOUS ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

THE GERMAN WENT OFF INTO A LOUD ABRUPT GUFFAW LIKE A NEIGH, EVIDENTLY IMAGINING THAT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HAD SAID SOMETHING EXCEEDINGLY FUNNY. THE LATTER GAZED AT HIM WITH STUDIED AMAZEMENT BUT PRODUCED NO EFFECT ON HIM WHATEVER. THE PRINCE, TOO, LOOKED AT THE GERMAN, TURNING HEAD, COLLAR AND ALL, TOWARDS HIM AND PUTTING UP HIS PINCE-NEZ, THOUGH WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST CURIOSITY.

‚ÄÚ‚Ä¶ IS BOUND TO SEEM MONOTONOUS,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH INTENTIONALLY REPEATED, DRAWLING EACH WORD AS DELIBERATELY AND NONCHALANTLY AS POSSIBLE. ‚ÄÚAND SO MY LIFE HAS BEEN THROUGHOUT THIS QUARTER OF A CENTURY, ET COMME ON TROUVE PARTOUT PLUS DE MOINES QUE DE RAISON, AND AS I AM ENTIRELY OF THIS OPINION, IT HAS COME TO PASS THAT THROUGHOUT THIS QUARTER OF A CENTURY I ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚC‚ÄÔEST CHARMANT, LES MOINES,‚ÄÙ WHISPERED YULIA MIHAILOVNA, TURNING TO VARVARA PETROVNA, WHO WAS SITTING BESIDE HER.

VARVARA PETROVNA RESPONDED WITH A LOOK OF PRIDE. BUT KARMAZINOV COULD NOT STOMACH THE SUCCESS OF THE FRENCH PHRASE, AND QUICKLY AND SHRILLY INTERRUPTED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.

‚ÄÚAS FOR ME, I AM QUITE AT REST ON THAT SCORE, AND FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS I‚ÄÔVE BEEN SETTLED AT KARLSRUHE. AND LAST YEAR, WHEN IT WAS PROPOSED BY THE TOWN COUNCIL TO LAY DOWN A NEW WATER-PIPE, I FELT IN MY HEART THAT THIS QUESTION OF WATER-PIPES IN KARLSRUHE WAS DEARER AND CLOSER TO MY HEART THAN ALL THE QUESTIONS OF MY PRECIOUS FATHERLAND ‚Ä¶ IN THIS PERIOD OF SO-CALLED REFORM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI CAN‚ÄÔT HELP SYMPATHISING, THOUGH IT GOES AGAINST THE GRAIN,‚ÄÙ SIGHED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, BOWING HIS HEAD SIGNIFICANTLY.

YULIA MIHAILOVNA WAS TRIUMPHANT: THE CONVERSATION WAS BECOMING PROFOUND AND TAKING A POLITICAL TURN.

‚ÄÚA DRAIN-PIPE?‚ÄÙ THE DOCTOR INQUIRED IN A LOUD VOICE.

‚ÄÚA WATER-PIPE, DOCTOR, A WATER-PIPE, AND I POSITIVELY ASSISTED THEM IN DRAWING UP THE PLAN.‚ÄÙ

THE DOCTOR WENT OFF INTO A DEAFENING GUFFAW. MANY PEOPLE FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE, LAUGHING IN THE FACE OF THE DOCTOR, WHO REMAINED UNCONSCIOUS OF IT AND WAS HIGHLY DELIGHTED THAT EVERY ONE WAS LAUGHING.

‚ÄÚYOU MUST ALLOW ME TO DIFFER FROM YOU, KARMAZINOV,‚ÄÙ YULIA MIHAILOVNA HASTENED TO INTERPOSE. ‚ÄÚKARLSRUHE IS ALL VERY WELL, BUT YOU ARE FOND OF MYSTIFYING PEOPLE, AND THIS TIME WE DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE YOU. WHAT RUSSIAN WRITER HAS PRESENTED SO MANY MODERN TYPES, HAS BROUGHT FORWARD SO MANY CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS, HAS PUT HIS FINGER ON THE MOST VITAL MODERN POINTS WHICH MAKE UP THE TYPE OF THE MODERN MAN OF ACTION? YOU, ONLY YOU, AND NO ONE ELSE. IT‚ÄÔS NO USE YOUR ASSURING US OF YOUR COLDNESS TOWARDS YOUR OWN COUNTRY AND YOUR ARDENT INTEREST IN THE WATER-PIPES OF KARLSRUHE. HA HA!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, NO DOUBT,‚ÄÙ LISPED KARMAZINOV. ‚ÄÚI HAVE PORTRAYED IN THE CHARACTER OF POGOZHEV ALL THE FAILINGS OF THE SLAVOPHILS AND IN THE CHARACTER OF NIKODIMOV ALL THE FAILINGS OF THE WESTERNERS.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SAY, HARDLY ALL!‚ÄÙ LYAMSHIN WHISPERED SLYLY.

‚ÄÚBUT I DO THIS BY THE WAY, SIMPLY TO WHILE AWAY THE TEDIOUS HOURS AND TO SATISFY THE PERSISTENT DEMANDS OF MY FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH,‚ÄÙ YULIA MIHAILOVNA WENT ON ENTHUSIASTICALLY, ‚ÄÚTHAT TO-MORROW WE SHALL HAVE THE DELIGHT OF HEARING THE CHARMING LINES ‚Ä¶ ONE OF THE LAST OF SEMYON YAKOVLEVITCH‚ÄÔS EXQUISITE LITERARY INSPIRATIONS‚ÄÎIT‚ÄÔS CALLED MERCI. HE ANNOUNCES IN THIS PIECE THAT HE WILL WRITE NO MORE, THAT NOTHING IN THE WORLD WILL INDUCE HIM TO, IF ANGELS FROM HEAVEN OR, WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, ALL THE BEST SOCIETY WERE TO IMPLORE HIM TO CHANGE HIS MIND. IN FACT HE IS LAYING DOWN THE PEN FOR GOOD, AND THIS GRACEFUL MERCI IS ADDRESSED TO THE PUBLIC IN GRATEFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE CONSTANT ENTHUSIASM WITH WHICH IT HAS FOR SO MANY YEARS GREETED HIS UNSWERVING LOYALTY TO TRUE RUSSIAN THOUGHT.‚ÄÙ

YULIA MIHAILOVNA WAS AT THE ACME OF BLISS.

‚ÄÚYES, I SHALL MAKE MY FAREWELL; I SHALL SAY MY MERCI AND DEPART AND THERE ‚Ä¶ IN KARLSRUHE ‚Ä¶ I SHALL CLOSE MY EYES.‚ÄÙ KARMAZINOV WAS GRADUALLY BECOMING MAUDLIN.

LIKE MANY OF OUR GREAT WRITERS (AND THERE ARE NUMBERS OF THEM AMONGST US), HE COULD NOT RESIST PRAISE, AND BEGAN TO BE LIMP AT ONCE, IN SPITE OF HIS PENETRATING WIT. BUT I CONSIDER THIS IS PARDONABLE. THEY SAY THAT ONE OF OUR SHAKESPEARES POSITIVELY BLURTED OUT IN PRIVATE CONVERSATION THAT ‚ÄÚWE GREAT MEN CAN‚ÄÔT DO OTHERWISE,‚ÄÙ AND SO ON, AND, WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, WAS UNAWARE OF IT.

‚ÄÚTHERE IN KARLSRUHE I SHALL CLOSE MY EYES. WHEN WE HAVE DONE OUR DUTY, ALL THAT‚ÄÔS LEFT FOR US GREAT MEN IS TO MAKE HASTE TO CLOSE OUR EYES WITHOUT SEEKING A REWARD. I SHALL DO SO TOO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGIVE ME THE ADDRESS AND I SHALL COME TO KARLSRUHE TO VISIT YOUR TOMB,‚ÄÙ SAID THE GERMAN, LAUGHING IMMODERATELY.

‚ÄÚTHEY SEND CORPSES BY RAIL NOWADAYS,‚ÄÙ ONE OF THE LESS IMPORTANT YOUNG MEN SAID UNEXPECTEDLY.

LYAMSHIN POSITIVELY SHRIEKED WITH DELIGHT. YULIA MIHAILOVNA FROWNED. NIKOLAY STAVROGIN WALKED IN.

‚ÄÚWHY, I WAS TOLD THAT YOU WERE LOCKED UP?‚ÄÙ HE SAID ALOUD, ADDRESSING STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH BEFORE EVERY ONE ELSE.

‚ÄÚNO, IT WAS A CASE OF UNLOCKING,‚ÄÙ JESTED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.

‚ÄÚBUT I HOPE THAT WHAT‚ÄÔS HAPPENED WILL HAVE NO INFLUENCE ON WHAT I ASKED YOU TO DO,‚ÄÙ YULIA MIHAILOVNA PUT IN AGAIN. ‚ÄÚI TRUST THAT YOU WILL NOT LET THIS UNFORTUNATE ANNOYANCE, OF WHICH I HAD NO IDEA, LEAD YOU TO DISAPPOINT OUR EAGER EXPECTATIONS AND DEPRIVE US OF THE ENJOYMENT OF HEARING YOUR READING AT OUR LITERARY MATIN√©E.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT KNOW, I ‚Ä¶ NOW ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚREALLY, I AM SO UNLUCKY, VARVARA PETROVNA ‚Ä¶ AND ONLY FANCY, JUST WHEN I WAS SO LONGING TO MAKE THE PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE OF ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE AND INDEPENDENT INTELLECTS OF RUSSIA‚ÄÎAND HERE STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SUDDENLY TALKS OF DESERTING US.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOUR COMPLIMENT IS UTTERED SO AUDIBLY THAT I OUGHT TO PRETEND NOT TO HEAR IT,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SAID NEATLY, ‚ÄÚBUT I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT MY INSIGNIFICANT PRESENCE IS SO INDISPENSABLE AT YOUR F√™TE TO-MORROW. HOWEVER, I ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, YOU‚ÄÔLL SPOIL HIM!‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, BURSTING INTO THE ROOM. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE ONLY JUST GOT HIM IN HAND‚ÄÎAND IN ONE MORNING HE HAS BEEN SEARCHED, ARRESTED, TAKEN BY THE COLLAR BY A POLICEMAN, AND HERE LADIES ARE COOING TO HIM IN THE GOVERNOR‚ÄÔS DRAWING-ROOM. EVERY BONE IN HIS BODY IS ACHING WITH RAPTURE; IN HIS WILDEST DREAMS HE HAD NEVER HOPED FOR SUCH GOOD FORTUNE. NOW HE‚ÄÔLL BEGIN INFORMING AGAINST THE SOCIALISTS AFTER THIS!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIMPOSSIBLE, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH! SOCIALISM IS TOO GRAND AN IDEA TO BE UNRECOGNISED BY STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.‚ÄÙ YULIA MIHAILOVNA TOOK UP THE GAUNTLET WITH ENERGY.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS A GREAT IDEA BUT ITS EXPONENTS ARE NOT ALWAYS GREAT MEN, ET BRISONS-L√†, MON CHER,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH ENDED, ADDRESSING HIS SON AND RISING GRACEFULLY FROM HIS SEAT.

BUT AT THIS POINT AN UTTERLY UNEXPECTED CIRCUMSTANCE OCCURRED. VON LEMBKE HAD BEEN IN THE ROOM FOR SOME TIME BUT SEEMED UNNOTICED BY ANYONE, THOUGH EVERY ONE HAD SEEN HIM COME IN. IN ACCORDANCE WITH HER FORMER PLAN, YULIA MIHAILOVNA WENT ON IGNORING HIM. HE TOOK UP HIS POSITION NEAR THE DOOR AND WITH A STERN FACE LISTENED GLOOMILY TO THE CONVERSATION. HEARING AN ALLUSION TO THE EVENTS OF THE MORNING, HE BEGAN FIDGETING UNEASILY, STARED AT THE PRINCE, OBVIOUSLY STRUCK BY HIS STIFFLY STARCHED, PROMINENT COLLAR; THEN SUDDENLY HE SEEMED TO START ON HEARING THE VOICE OF PYOTR STEPANOVITCH AND SEEING HIM BURST IN; AND NO SOONER HAD STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH UTTERED HIS PHRASE ABOUT SOCIALISTS THAN LEMBKE WENT UP TO HIM, PUSHING AGAINST LYAMSHIN, WHO AT ONCE SKIPPED OUT OF THE WAY WITH AN AFFECTED GESTURE OF SURPRISE, RUBBING HIS SHOULDER AND PRETENDING THAT HE HAD BEEN TERRIBLY BRUISED.

‚ÄÚENOUGH!‚ÄÙ SAID VON LEMBKE TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, VIGOROUSLY GRIPPING THE HAND OF THE DISMAYED GENTLEMAN AND SQUEEZING IT WITH ALL HIS MIGHT IN BOTH OF HIS. ‚ÄÚENOUGH! THE FILIBUSTERS OF OUR DAY ARE UNMASKED. NOT ANOTHER WORD. MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

HE SPOKE LOUDLY ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY ALL THE ROOM, AND CONCLUDED WITH ENERGY. THE IMPRESSION HE PRODUCED WAS POIGNANT. EVERYBODY FELT THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG. I SAW YULIA MIHAILOVNA TURN PALE. THE EFFECT WAS HEIGHTENED BY A TRIVIAL ACCIDENT. AFTER ANNOUNCING THAT MEASURES HAD BEEN TAKEN, LEMBKE TURNED SHARPLY AND WALKED QUICKLY TOWARDS THE DOOR, BUT HE HAD HARDLY TAKEN TWO STEPS WHEN HE STUMBLED OVER A RUG, SWERVED FORWARD, AND ALMOST FELL. FOR A MOMENT HE STOOD STILL, LOOKED AT THE RUG AT WHICH HE HAD STUMBLED, AND, UTTERING ALOUD ‚ÄÚCHANGE IT!‚ÄÙ WENT OUT OF THE ROOM. YULIA MIHAILOVNA RAN AFTER HIM. HER EXIT WAS FOLLOWED BY AN UPROAR, IN WHICH IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH ANYTHING. SOME SAID HE WAS ‚ÄÚDERANGED,‚ÄÙ OTHERS THAT HE WAS ‚ÄÚLIABLE TO ATTACKS‚ÄÙ; OTHERS PUT THEIR FINGERS TO THEIR FOREHEAD; LYAMSHIN, IN THE CORNER, PUT HIS TWO FINGERS ABOVE HIS FOREHEAD. PEOPLE HINTED AT SOME DOMESTIC DIFFICULTIES‚ÄÎIN A WHISPER, OF COURSE. NO ONE TOOK UP HIS HAT; ALL WERE WAITING. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT YULIA MIHAILOVNA MANAGED TO DO, BUT FIVE MINUTES LATER SHE CAME BACK, DOING HER UTMOST TO APPEAR COMPOSED. SHE REPLIED EVASIVELY THAT ANDREY ANTONOVITCH WAS RATHER EXCITED, BUT THAT IT MEANT NOTHING, THAT HE HAD BEEN LIKE THAT FROM A CHILD, THAT SHE KNEW ‚ÄÚMUCH BETTER,‚ÄÙ AND THAT THE F√™TE NEXT DAY WOULD CERTAINLY CHEER HIM UP. THEN FOLLOWED A FEW FLATTERING WORDS TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SIMPLY FROM CIVILITY, AND A LOUD INVITATION TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO OPEN THE MEETING NOW, AT ONCE. ONLY THEN, ALL WHO WERE NOT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PREPARED TO GO HOME; BUT THE PAINFUL INCIDENTS OF THIS FATAL DAY WERE NOT YET OVER.

I NOTICED AT THE MOMENT WHEN NIKOLAY STAVROGIN CAME IN THAT LIZA LOOKED QUICKLY AND INTENTLY AT HIM AND WAS FOR A LONG TIME UNABLE TO TAKE HER EYES OFF HIM‚ÄÎSO MUCH SO THAT AT LAST IT ATTRACTED ATTENTION. I SAW MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH BEND OVER HER FROM BEHIND; HE SEEMED TO MEAN TO WHISPER SOMETHING TO HER, BUT EVIDENTLY CHANGED HIS INTENTION AND DREW HIMSELF UP QUICKLY, LOOKING ROUND AT EVERY ONE WITH A GUILTY AIR. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH TOO EXCITED CURIOSITY; HIS FACE WAS PALER THAN USUAL AND THERE WAS A STRANGELY ABSENT-MINDED LOOK IN HIS EYES. AFTER FLINGING HIS QUESTION AT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HE SEEMED TO FORGET ABOUT HIM ALTOGETHER, AND I REALLY BELIEVE HE EVEN FORGOT TO SPEAK TO HIS HOSTESS. HE DID NOT ONCE LOOK AT LIZA‚ÄÎNOT BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO, BUT I AM CERTAIN BECAUSE HE DID NOT NOTICE HER EITHER. AND SUDDENLY, AFTER THE BRIEF SILENCE THAT FOLLOWED YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS INVITATION TO OPEN THE MEETING WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME, LIZA‚ÄÔS MUSICAL VOICE, INTENTIONALLY LOUD, WAS HEARD. SHE CALLED TO STAVROGIN.

‚ÄÚNIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, A CAPTAIN WHO CALLS HIMSELF A RELATION OF YOURS, THE BROTHER OF YOUR WIFE, AND WHOSE NAME IS LEBYADKIN, KEEPS WRITING IMPERTINENT LETTERS TO ME, COMPLAINING OF YOU AND OFFERING TO TELL ME SOME SECRETS ABOUT YOU. IF HE REALLY IS A CONNECTION OF YOURS, PLEASE TELL HIM NOT TO ANNOY ME, AND SAVE ME FROM THIS UNPLEASANTNESS.‚ÄÙ

THERE WAS A NOTE OF DESPERATE CHALLENGE IN THESE WORDS‚ÄÎEVERY ONE REALISED IT. THE ACCUSATION WAS UNMISTAKABLE, THOUGH PERHAPS IT WAS A SURPRISE TO HERSELF. SHE WAS LIKE A MAN WHO SHUTS HIS EYES AND THROWS HIMSELF FROM THE ROOF.

BUT NIKOLAY STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS ANSWER WAS EVEN MORE ASTOUNDING.

TO BEGIN WITH, IT WAS STRANGE THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST SURPRISED AND LISTENED TO LIZA WITH UNRUFFLED ATTENTION. THERE WAS NO TRACE OF EITHER CONFUSION OR ANGER IN HIS FACE. SIMPLY, FIRMLY, EVEN WITH AN AIR OF PERFECT READINESS, HE ANSWERED THE FATAL QUESTION:

‚ÄÚYES, I HAVE THE MISFORTUNE TO BE CONNECTED WITH THAT MAN. I HAVE BEEN THE HUSBAND OF HIS SISTER FOR NEARLY FIVE YEARS. YOU MAY BE SURE I WILL GIVE HIM YOUR MESSAGE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND I‚ÄÔLL ANSWER FOR IT THAT HE SHAN‚ÄÔT ANNOY YOU AGAIN.‚ÄÙ

I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE HORROR THAT WAS REFLECTED ON THE FACE OF VARVARA PETROVNA. WITH A DISTRACTED AIR SHE GOT UP FROM HER SEAT, LIFTING UP HER RIGHT HAND AS THOUGH TO WARD OFF A BLOW. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH LOOKED AT HER, LOOKED AT LIZA, AT THE SPECTATORS, AND SUDDENLY SMILED WITH INFINITE DISDAIN; HE WALKED DELIBERATELY OUT OF THE ROOM. EVERY ONE SAW HOW LIZA LEAPT UP FROM THE SOFA AS SOON AS HE TURNED TO GO AND UNMISTAKABLY MADE A MOVEMENT TO RUN AFTER HIM. BUT SHE CONTROLLED HERSELF AND DID NOT RUN AFTER HIM; SHE WENT QUIETLY OUT OF THE ROOM WITHOUT SAYING A WORD OR EVEN LOOKING AT ANYONE, ACCOMPANIED, OF COURSE, BY MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, WHO RUSHED AFTER HER.

THE UPROAR AND THE GOSSIP THAT NIGHT IN THE TOWN I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE. VARVARA PETROVNA SHUT HERSELF UP IN HER TOWN HOUSE AND NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, IT WAS SAID, WENT STRAIGHT TO SKVORESHNIKI WITHOUT SEEING HIS MOTHER. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SENT ME THAT EVENING TO CETTE CH√®RE AMIE TO IMPLORE HER TO ALLOW HIM TO COME TO HER, BUT SHE WOULD NOT SEE ME. HE WAS TERRIBLY OVERWHELMED; HE SHED TEARS. ‚ÄÚSUCH A MARRIAGE! SUCH A MARRIAGE! SUCH AN AWFUL THING IN THE FAMILY!‚ÄÙ HE KEPT REPEATING. HE REMEMBERED KARMAZINOV, HOWEVER, AND ABUSED HIM TERRIBLY. HE SET TO WORK VIGOROUSLY TO PREPARE FOR THE READING TOO AND‚ÄÎTHE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT!‚ÄÎREHEARSED BEFORE THE LOOKING-GLASS AND WENT OVER ALL THE JOKES AND WITTICISMS UTTERED IN THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN DOWN IN A SEPARATE NOTEBOOK, TO INSERT INTO HIS READING NEXT DAY.

‚ÄÚMY DEAR, I DO THIS FOR THE SAKE OF A GREAT IDEA,‚ÄÙ HE SAID TO ME, OBVIOUSLY JUSTIFYING HIMSELF. ‚ÄÚCHER AMI, I HAVE BEEN STATIONARY FOR TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AND SUDDENLY I‚ÄÔVE BEGUN TO MOVE‚ÄÎWHITHER, I KNOW NOT‚ÄÎBUT I‚ÄÔVE BEGUN TO MOVE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

CHAPTER I. THE FETE‚ÄÎFIRST PART

I

THE F√™TE TOOK PLACE IN SPITE OF ALL THE PERPLEXITIES OF THE PRECEDING ‚ÄÚSHPIGULIN‚ÄÙ DAY. I BELIEVE THAT EVEN IF LEMBKE HAD DIED THE PREVIOUS NIGHT, THE F√™TE WOULD STILL HAVE TAKEN PLACE NEXT MORNING‚ÄÎSO PECULIAR WAS THE SIGNIFICANCE YULIA MIHAILOVNA ATTACHED TO IT. ALAS! UP TO THE LAST MOMENT SHE WAS BLIND AND HAD NO INKLING OF THE STATE OF PUBLIC FEELING. NO ONE BELIEVED AT LAST THAT THE FESTIVE DAY WOULD PASS WITHOUT SOME TREMENDOUS SCANDAL, SOME ‚ÄÚCATASTROPHE‚ÄÙ AS SOME PEOPLE EXPRESSED IT, RUBBING THEIR HANDS IN ANTICIPATION. MANY PEOPLE, IT IS TRUE, TRIED TO ASSUME A FROWNING AND DIPLOMATIC COUNTENANCE; BUT, SPEAKING GENERALLY, EVERY RUSSIAN IS INORDINATELY DELIGHTED AT ANY PUBLIC SCANDAL AND DISORDER. IT IS TRUE THAT WE DID FEEL SOMETHING MUCH MORE SERIOUS THAN THE MERE CRAVING FOR A SCANDAL: THERE WAS A GENERAL FEELING OF IRRITATION, A FEELING OF IMPLACABLE RESENTMENT; EVERY ONE SEEMED THOROUGHLY DISGUSTED WITH EVERYTHING. A KIND OF BEWILDERED CYNICISM, A FORCED, AS IT WERE, STRAINED CYNICISM WAS PREDOMINANT IN EVERY ONE. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO WERE FREE FROM BEWILDERMENT WERE THE LADIES, AND THEY WERE CLEAR ON ONLY ONE POINT: THEIR REMORSELESS DETESTATION OF YULIA MIHAILOVNA. LADIES OF ALL SHADES OF OPINION WERE AGREED IN THIS. AND SHE, POOR DEAR, HAD NO SUSPICION; UP TO THE LAST HOUR SHE WAS PERSUADED THAT SHE WAS ‚ÄÚSURROUNDED BY FOLLOWERS,‚ÄÙ AND THAT THEY WERE STILL ‚ÄÚFANATICALLY DEVOTED TO HER.‚ÄÙ

I HAVE ALREADY HINTED THAT SOME LOW FELLOWS OF DIFFERENT SORTS HAD MADE THEIR APPEARANCE AMONGST US. IN TURBULENT TIMES OF UPHEAVAL OR TRANSITION LOW CHARACTERS ALWAYS COME TO THE FRONT EVERYWHERE. I AM NOT SPEAKING NOW OF THE SO-CALLED ‚ÄÚADVANCED‚ÄÙ PEOPLE WHO ARE ALWAYS IN A HURRY TO BE IN ADVANCE OF EVERY ONE ELSE (THEIR ABSORBING ANXIETY) AND WHO ALWAYS HAVE SOME MORE OR LESS DEFINITE, THOUGH OFTEN VERY STUPID, AIM. NO, I AM SPEAKING ONLY OF THE RIFF-RAFF. IN EVERY PERIOD OF TRANSITION THIS RIFF-RAFF, WHICH EXISTS IN EVERY SOCIETY, RISES TO THE SURFACE, AND IS NOT ONLY WITHOUT ANY AIM BUT HAS NOT EVEN A SYMPTOM OF AN IDEA, AND MERELY DOES ITS UTMOST TO GIVE EXPRESSION TO UNEASINESS AND IMPATIENCE. MOREOVER, THIS RIFF-RAFF ALMOST ALWAYS FALLS UNCONSCIOUSLY UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE LITTLE GROUP OF ‚ÄÚADVANCED PEOPLE‚ÄÙ WHO DO ACT WITH A DEFINITE AIM, AND THIS LITTLE GROUP CAN DIRECT ALL THIS RABBLE AS IT PLEASES, IF ONLY IT DOES NOT ITSELF CONSIST OF ABSOLUTE IDIOTS, WHICH, HOWEVER, IS SOMETIMES THE CASE. IT IS SAID AMONG US NOW THAT IT IS ALL OVER, THAT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS DIRECTED BY THE INTERNATIONALE, AND YULIA MIHAILOVNA BY PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WHILE SHE CONTROLLED, UNDER HIS RULE, A RABBLE OF ALL SORTS. THE MORE SOBER MINDS AMONGST US WONDER AT THEMSELVES NOW, AND CAN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAME TO BE SO FOOLISH AT THE TIME.

WHAT CONSTITUTED THE TURBULENCE OF OUR TIME AND WHAT TRANSITION IT WAS WE WERE PASSING THROUGH I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW, NOR I THINK DOES ANYONE, UNLESS IT WERE SOME OF THOSE VISITORS OF OURS. YET THE MOST WORTHLESS FELLOWS SUDDENLY GAINED PREDOMINANT INFLUENCE, BEGAN LOUDLY CRITICISING EVERYTHING SACRED, THOUGH TILL THEN THEY HAD NOT DARED TO OPEN THEIR MOUTHS, WHILE THE LEADING PEOPLE, WHO HAD TILL THEN SO SATISFACTORILY KEPT THE UPPER HAND, BEGAN LISTENING TO THEM AND HOLDING THEIR PEACE, SOME EVEN SIMPERED APPROVAL IN A MOST SHAMELESS WAY. PEOPLE LIKE LYAMSHIN AND TELYATNIKOV, LIKE GOGOL‚ÄÔS TENTYOTNIKOV, DRIVELLING HOME-BRED EDITIONS OF RADISHTCHEV, WRETCHED LITTLE JEWS WITH A MOURNFUL BUT HAUGHTY SMILE, GUFFAWING FOREIGNERS, POETS OF ADVANCED TENDENCIES FROM THE CAPITAL, POETS WHO MADE UP WITH PEASANT COATS AND TARRED BOOTS FOR THE LACK OF TENDENCIES OR TALENTS, MAJORS AND COLONELS WHO RIDICULED THE SENSELESSNESS OF THE SERVICE, AND WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN READY FOR AN EXTRA ROUBLE TO UNBUCKLE THEIR SWORDS, AND TAKE JOBS AS RAILWAY CLERKS; GENERALS WHO HAD ABANDONED THEIR DUTIES TO BECOME LAWYERS; ADVANCED MEDIATORS, ADVANCING MERCHANTS, INNUMERABLE DIVINITY STUDENTS, WOMEN WHO WERE THE EMBODIMENT OF THE WOMAN QUESTION‚ÄÎALL THESE SUDDENLY GAINED COMPLETE SWAY AMONG US AND OVER WHOM? OVER THE CLUB, THE VENERABLE OFFICIALS, OVER GENERALS WITH WOODEN LEGS, OVER THE VERY STRICT AND INACCESSIBLE LADIES OF OUR LOCAL SOCIETY. SINCE EVEN VARVARA PETROVNA WAS ALMOST AT THE BECK AND CALL OF THIS RABBLE, RIGHT UP TO THE TIME OF THE CATASTROPHE WITH HER SON, OUR OTHER LOCAL MINERVAS MAY WELL BE PARDONED FOR THEIR TEMPORARY ABERRATION. NOW ALL THIS IS ATTRIBUTED, AS I HAVE MENTIONED ALREADY, TO THE INTERNATIONALE. THIS IDEA HAS TAKEN SUCH ROOT THAT IT IS GIVEN AS THE EXPLANATION TO VISITORS FROM OTHER PARTS. ONLY LATELY COUNCILLOR KUBRIKOV, A MAN OF SIXTY-TWO, WITH THE STANISLAV ORDER ON HIS BREAST, CAME FORWARD UNINVITED AND CONFESSED IN A VOICE FULL OF FEELING THAT HE HAD BEYOND A SHADOW OF DOUBT BEEN FOR FULLY THREE MONTHS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE INTERNATIONALE. WHEN WITH EVERY DEFERENCE FOR HIS YEARS AND SERVICES HE WAS INVITED TO BE MORE DEFINITE, HE STUCK FIRMLY TO HIS ORIGINAL STATEMENT, THOUGH HE COULD PRODUCE NO EVIDENCE EXCEPT THAT ‚ÄÚHE HAD FELT IT IN ALL HIS FEELINGS,‚ÄÙ SO THAT THEY CROSS-EXAMINED HIM NO FURTHER.

I REPEAT AGAIN, THERE WAS STILL EVEN AMONG US A SMALL GROUP WHO HELD THEMSELVES ALOOF FROM THE BEGINNING, AND EVEN LOCKED THEMSELVES UP. BUT WHAT LOCK CAN STAND AGAINST A LAW OF NATURE? DAUGHTERS WILL GROW UP EVEN IN THE MOST CAREFUL FAMILIES, AND IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR GROWN-UP DAUGHTERS TO DANCE.

AND SO ALL THESE PEOPLE, TOO, ENDED BY SUBSCRIBING TO THE GOVERNESSES‚ÄÔ FUND.

THE BALL WAS ASSUMED TO BE AN ENTERTAINMENT SO BRILLIANT, SO UNPRECEDENTED; MARVELS WERE TOLD ABOUT IT; THERE WERE RUMOURS OF PRINCES FROM A DISTANCE WITH LORGNETTES; OF TEN STEWARDS, ALL YOUNG DANDIES, WITH ROSETTES ON THEIR LEFT SHOULDER; OF SOME PETERSBURG PEOPLE WHO WERE SETTING THE THING GOING; THERE WAS A RUMOUR THAT KARMAZINOV HAD CONSENTED TO INCREASE THE SUBSCRIPTIONS TO THE FUND BY READING HIS MERCI IN THE COSTUME OF THE GOVERNESSES OF THE DISTRICT; THAT THERE WOULD BE A LITERARY QUADRILLE ALL IN COSTUME, AND EVERY COSTUME WOULD SYMBOLISE SOME SPECIAL LINE OF THOUGHT; AND FINALLY THAT ‚ÄÚHONEST RUSSIAN THOUGHT‚ÄÙ WOULD DANCE IN COSTUME‚ÄÎWHICH WOULD CERTAINLY BE A COMPLETE NOVELTY IN ITSELF. WHO COULD RESIST SUBSCRIBING? EVERY ONE SUBSCRIBED.

II

THE PROGRAMME OF THE F√™TE WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS: THE LITERARY MATIN√©E FROM MIDDAY TILL FOUR O‚ÄÔCLOCK, AND AFTERWARDS A BALL FROM TEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK ONWARDS THROUGH THE NIGHT. BUT IN THIS VERY PROGRAMME THERE LAY CONCEALED GERMS OF DISORDER. IN THE FIRST PLACE, FROM THE VERY BEGINNING A RUMOUR HAD GAINED GROUND AMONG THE PUBLIC CONCERNING A LUNCHEON IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE LITERARY MATIN√©E, OR EVEN WHILE IT WAS GOING ON, DURING AN INTERVAL ARRANGED EXPRESSLY FOR IT‚ÄÎA FREE LUNCHEON, OF COURSE, WHICH WOULD FORM PART OF THE PROGRAMME AND BE ACCOMPANIED BY CHAMPAGNE. THE IMMENSE PRICE OF THE TICKETS (THREE ROUBLES) TENDED TO CONFIRM THIS RUMOUR. ‚ÄÚAS THOUGH ONE WOULD SUBSCRIBE FOR NOTHING? THE F√™TE IS ARRANGED FOR TWENTY-FOUR HOURS, SO FOOD MUST BE PROVIDED. PEOPLE WILL GET HUNGRY.‚ÄÙ THIS WAS HOW PEOPLE REASONED IN THE TOWN. I MUST ADMIT THAT YULIA MIHAILOVNA DID MUCH TO CONFIRM THIS DISASTROUS RUMOUR BY HER OWN HEEDLESSNESS. A MONTH EARLIER, UNDER THE FIRST SPELL OF THE GREAT PROJECT, SHE WOULD BABBLE ABOUT IT TO ANYONE SHE MET; AND EVEN SENT A PARAGRAPH TO ONE OF THE PETERSBURG PAPERS ABOUT THE TOASTS AND SPEECHES ARRANGED FOR HER F√™TE. WHAT FASCINATED HER MOST AT THAT TIME WAS THE IDEA OF THESE TOASTS; SHE WANTED TO PROPOSE THEM HERSELF AND WAS CONTINUALLY COMPOSING THEM IN ANTICIPATION. THEY WERE TO MAKE CLEAR WHAT WAS THEIR BANNER (WHAT WAS IT? I DON‚ÄÔT MIND BETTING THAT THE POOR DEAR COMPOSED NOTHING AFTER ALL), THEY WERE TO GET INTO THE PETERSBURG AND MOSCOW PAPERS, TO TOUCH AND FASCINATE THE HIGHER POWERS AND THEN TO SPREAD THE IDEA OVER ALL THE PROVINCES OF RUSSIA, ROUSING PEOPLE TO WONDER AND IMITATION.

BUT FOR TOASTS, CHAMPAGNE WAS ESSENTIAL, AND AS CHAMPAGNE CAN‚ÄÔT BE DRUNK ON AN EMPTY STOMACH, IT FOLLOWED THAT A LUNCH WAS ESSENTIAL TOO. AFTERWARDS, WHEN BY HER EFFORTS A COMMITTEE HAD BEEN FORMED AND HAD ATTACKED THE SUBJECT MORE SERIOUSLY, IT WAS PROVED CLEARLY TO HER AT ONCE THAT IF THEY WERE GOING TO DREAM OF BANQUETS THERE WOULD BE VERY LITTLE LEFT FOR THE GOVERNESSES, HOWEVER WELL PEOPLE SUBSCRIBED. THERE WERE TWO WAYS OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY: EITHER BELSHAZZAR‚ÄÔS FEAST WITH TOASTS AND SPEECHES, AND NINETY ROUBLES FOR THE GOVERNESSES, OR A CONSIDERABLE SUM OF MONEY WITH THE F√™TE ONLY AS A MATTER OF FORM TO RAISE IT. THE COMMITTEE, HOWEVER, ONLY WANTED TO SCARE HER, AND HAD OF COURSE WORKED OUT A THIRD COURSE OF ACTION, WHICH WAS REASONABLE AND COMBINED THE ADVANTAGES OF BOTH, THAT IS, A VERY DECENT F√™TE IN EVERY RESPECT ONLY WITHOUT CHAMPAGNE, AND SO YIELDING A VERY RESPECTABLE SUM, MUCH MORE THAN NINETY ROUBLES. BUT YULIA MIHAILOVNA WOULD NOT AGREE TO IT: HER PROUD SPIRIT REVOLTED FROM PALTRY COMPROMISE. SHE DECIDED AT ONCE THAT IF THE ORIGINAL IDEA COULD NOT BE CARRIED OUT THEY SHOULD RUSH TO THE OPPOSITE EXTREME, THAT IS, RAISE AN ENORMOUS SUBSCRIPTION THAT WOULD BE THE ENVY OF OTHER PROVINCES. ‚ÄÚTHE PUBLIC MUST UNDERSTAND,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID AT THE END OF HER FLAMING SPEECH TO THE COMMITTEE, ‚ÄÚTHAT THE ATTAINMENT OF AN OBJECT OF UNIVERSAL HUMAN INTEREST IS INFINITELY LOFTIER THAN THE CORPOREAL ENJOYMENTS OF THE PASSING MOMENT, THAT THE F√™TE IN ITS ESSENCE IS ONLY THE PROCLAMATION OF A GREAT IDEA, AND SO WE OUGHT TO BE CONTENT WITH THE MOST FRUGAL GERMAN BALL SIMPLY AS A SYMBOL, THAT IS, IF WE CAN‚ÄÔT DISPENSE WITH THIS DETESTABLE BALL ALTOGETHER,‚ÄÙ SO GREAT WAS THE AVERSION SHE SUDDENLY CONCEIVED FOR IT. BUT SHE WAS PACIFIED AT LAST. IT WAS THEN THAT ‚ÄÚTHE LITERARY QUADRILLE‚ÄÙ AND THE OTHER √¶STHETIC ITEMS WERE INVENTED AND PROPOSED AS SUBSTITUTES FOR THE CORPOREAL ENJOYMENTS. IT WAS THEN THAT KARMAZINOV FINALLY CONSENTED TO READ MERCI (UNTIL THEN HE HAD ONLY TANTALISED THEM BY HIS HESITATION) AND SO ERADICATE THE VERY IDEA OF VICTUALS FROM THE MINDS OF OUR INCONTINENT PUBLIC. SO THE BALL WAS ONCE MORE TO BE A MAGNIFICENT FUNCTION, THOUGH IN A DIFFERENT STYLE. AND NOT TO BE TOO ETHEREAL IT WAS DECIDED THAT TEA WITH LEMON AND ROUND BISCUITS SHOULD BE SERVED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BALL, AND LATER ON ‚ÄÚORCHADE‚ÄÙ AND LEMONADE AND AT THE END EVEN ICES‚ÄÎBUT NOTHING ELSE. FOR THOSE WHO ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE ARE HUNGRY AND, STILL MORE, THIRSTY, THEY MIGHT OPEN A BUFFET IN THE FARTHEST OF THE SUITE OF ROOMS AND PUT IT IN CHARGE OF PROHOROVITCH, THE HEAD COOK OF THE CLUB, WHO WOULD, SUBJECT TO THE STRICT SUPERVISION OF THE COMMITTEE, SERVE WHATEVER WAS WANTED, AT A FIXED CHARGE, AND A NOTICE SHOULD BE PUT UP ON THE DOOR OF THE HALL THAT REFRESHMENTS WERE EXTRA. BUT ON THE MORNING THEY DECIDED NOT TO OPEN THE BUFFET AT ALL FOR FEAR OF DISTURBING THE READING, THOUGH THE BUFFET WOULD HAVE BEEN FIVE ROOMS OFF THE WHITE HALL IN WHICH KARMAZINOV HAD CONSENTED TO READ MERCI.

IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE COMMITTEE, AND EVEN THE MOST PRACTICAL PEOPLE IN IT, ATTACHED ENORMOUS CONSEQUENCE TO THIS READING. AS FOR PEOPLE OF POETICAL TENDENCIES, THE MARSHAL‚ÄÔS WIFE, FOR INSTANCE, INFORMED KARMAZINOV THAT AFTER THE READING SHE WOULD IMMEDIATELY ORDER A MARBLE SLAB TO BE PUT UP IN THE WALL OF THE WHITE HALL WITH AN INSCRIPTION IN GOLD LETTERS, THAT ON SUCH A DAY AND YEAR, HERE, IN THIS PLACE, THE GREAT WRITER OF RUSSIA AND OF EUROPE HAD READ MERCI ON LAYING ASIDE HIS PEN, AND SO HAD FOR THE FIRST TIME TAKEN LEAVE OF THE RUSSIAN PUBLIC REPRESENTED BY THE LEADING CITIZENS OF OUR TOWN, AND THAT THIS INSCRIPTION WOULD BE READ BY ALL AT THE BALL, THAT IS, ONLY FIVE HOURS AFTER MERCI HAD BEEN READ. I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT KARMAZINOV IT WAS WHO INSISTED THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO BUFFET IN THE MORNING ON ANY ACCOUNT, WHILE HE WAS READING, IN SPITE OF SOME PROTESTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT THIS WAS RATHER OPPOSED TO OUR WAY OF DOING THINGS.

THIS WAS THE POSITION OF AFFAIRS, WHILE IN THE TOWN PEOPLE WERE STILL RECKONING ON A BELSHAZZAR FEAST, THAT IS, ON REFRESHMENTS PROVIDED BY THE COMMITTEE; THEY BELIEVED IN THIS TO THE LAST HOUR. EVEN THE YOUNG LADIES WERE DREAMING OF MASSES OF SWEETS AND PRESERVES, AND SOMETHING MORE BEYOND THEIR IMAGINATION. EVERY ONE KNEW THAT THE SUBSCRIPTIONS HAD REACHED A HUGE SUM, THAT ALL THE TOWN WAS STRUGGLING TO GO, THAT PEOPLE WERE DRIVING IN FROM THE SURROUNDING DISTRICTS, AND THAT THERE WERE NOT TICKETS ENOUGH. IT WAS KNOWN, TOO, THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME LARGE SUBSCRIPTIONS APART FROM THE PRICE PAID FOR TICKETS: VARVARA PETROVNA, FOR INSTANCE, HAD PAID THREE HUNDRED ROUBLES FOR HER TICKET AND HAD GIVEN ALMOST ALL THE FLOWERS FROM HER CONSERVATORY TO DECORATE THE ROOM. THE MARSHAL‚ÄÔS WIFE, WHO WAS A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE, PROVIDED THE HOUSE AND THE LIGHTING; THE CLUB FURNISHED THE MUSIC, THE ATTENDANTS, AND GAVE UP PROHOROVITCH FOR THE WHOLE DAY. THERE WERE OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS AS WELL, THOUGH LESSER ONES, SO MUCH SO INDEED THAT THE IDEA WAS MOOTED OF CUTTING DOWN THE PRICE OF TICKETS FROM THREE ROUBLES TO TWO. INDEED, THE COMMITTEE WERE AFRAID AT FIRST THAT THREE ROUBLES WOULD BE TOO MUCH FOR YOUNG LADIES TO PAY, AND SUGGESTED THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE FAMILY TICKETS, SO THAT EVERY FAMILY SHOULD PAY FOR ONE DAUGHTER ONLY, WHILE THE OTHER YOUNG LADIES OF THE FAMILY, EVEN IF THERE WERE A DOZEN SPECIMENS, SHOULD BE ADMITTED FREE. BUT ALL THEIR APPREHENSIONS TURNED OUT TO BE GROUNDLESS: IT WAS JUST THE YOUNG LADIES WHO DID COME. EVEN THE POOREST CLERKS BROUGHT THEIR GIRLS, AND IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT IF THEY HAD HAD NO GIRLS IT WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED TO THEM TO SUBSCRIBE FOR TICKETS. ONE INSIGNIFICANT LITTLE SECRETARY BROUGHT ALL HIS SEVEN DAUGHTERS, TO SAY NOTHING OF HIS WIFE AND A NIECE INTO THE BARGAIN, AND EVERY ONE OF THESE PERSONS HELD IN HER HAND AN ENTRANCE TICKET THAT COST THREE ROUBLES.

IT MAY BE IMAGINED WHAT AN UPHEAVAL IT MADE IN THE TOWN! ONE HAS ONLY TO REMEMBER THAT AS THE F√™TE WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS EVERY LADY NEEDED TWO COSTUMES FOR THE OCCASION‚ÄÎA MORNING ONE FOR THE MATIN√©E AND A BALL DRESS FOR THE EVENING. MANY MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE, AS IT APPEARED AFTERWARDS, HAD PAWNED EVERYTHING THEY HAD FOR THAT DAY, EVEN THE FAMILY LINEN, EVEN THE SHEETS, AND POSSIBLY THE MATTRESSES, TO THE JEWS, WHO HAD BEEN SETTLING IN OUR TOWN IN GREAT NUMBERS DURING THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS AND WHO BECAME MORE AND MORE NUMEROUS AS TIME WENT ON. ALMOST ALL THE OFFICIALS HAD ASKED FOR THEIR SALARY IN ADVANCE, AND SOME OF THE LANDOWNERS SOLD BEASTS THEY COULD ILL SPARE, AND ALL SIMPLY TO BRING THEIR LADIES GOT UP AS MARCHIONESSES, AND TO BE AS GOOD AS ANYBODY. THE MAGNIFICENCE OF DRESSES ON THIS OCCASION WAS SOMETHING UNHEARD OF IN OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD. FOR A FORTNIGHT BEFOREHAND THE TOWN WAS OVERFLOWING WITH FUNNY STORIES WHICH WERE ALL BROUGHT BY OUR WITS TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS COURT. CARICATURES WERE PASSED FROM HAND TO HAND. I HAVE SEEN SOME DRAWINGS OF THE SORT MYSELF, IN YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS ALBUM. ALL THIS REACHED THE EARS OF THE FAMILIES WHO WERE THE SOURCE OF THE JOKES; I BELIEVE THIS WAS THE CAUSE OF THE GENERAL HATRED OF YULIA MIHAILOVNA WHICH HAD GROWN SO STRONG IN THE TOWN. PEOPLE SWEAR AND GNASH THEIR TEETH WHEN THEY THINK OF IT NOW. BUT IT WAS EVIDENT, EVEN AT THE TIME, THAT IF THE COMMITTEE WERE TO DISPLEASE THEM IN ANYTHING, OR IF ANYTHING WENT WRONG AT THE BALL, THE OUTBURST OF INDIGNATION WOULD BE SOMETHING SURPRISING. THAT‚ÄÔS WHY EVERY ONE WAS SECRETLY EXPECTING A SCANDAL; AND IF IT WAS SO CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED, HOW COULD IT FAIL TO COME TO PASS?

THE ORCHESTRA STRUCK UP PUNCTUALLY AT MIDDAY. BEING ONE OF THE STEWARDS, THAT IS, ONE OF THE TWELVE ‚ÄÚYOUNG MEN WITH A ROSETTE,‚ÄÙ I SAW WITH MY OWN EYES HOW THIS DAY OF IGNOMINIOUS MEMORY BEGAN. IT BEGAN WITH AN ENORMOUS CRUSH AT THE DOORS. HOW WAS IT THAT EVERYTHING, INCLUDING THE POLICE, WENT WRONG THAT DAY? I DON‚ÄÔT BLAME THE GENUINE PUBLIC: THE FATHERS OF FAMILIES DID NOT CROWD, NOR DID THEY PUSH AGAINST ANYONE, IN SPITE OF THEIR POSITION. ON THE CONTRARY, I AM TOLD THAT THEY WERE DISCONCERTED EVEN IN THE STREET, AT THE SIGHT OF THE CROWD SHOVING IN A WAY UNHEARD OF IN OUR TOWN, BESIEGING THE ENTRY AND TAKING IT BY ASSAULT, INSTEAD OF SIMPLY GOING IN. MEANWHILE THE CARRIAGES KEPT DRIVING UP, AND AT LAST BLOCKED THE STREET. NOW, AT THE TIME I WRITE, I HAVE GOOD GROUNDS FOR AFFIRMING THAT SOME OF THE LOWEST RABBLE OF OUR TOWN WERE BROUGHT IN WITHOUT TICKETS BY LYAMSHIN AND LIPUTIN, POSSIBLY, TOO, BY OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE STEWARDS LIKE ME. ANYWAY, SOME COMPLETE STRANGERS, WHO HAD COME FROM THE SURROUNDING DISTRICTS AND ELSEWHERE, WERE PRESENT. AS SOON AS THESE SAVAGES ENTERED THE HALL THEY BEGAN ASKING WHERE THE BUFFET WAS, AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN PUT UP TO IT BEFOREHAND, AND LEARNING THAT THERE WAS NO BUFFET THEY BEGAN SWEARING WITH BRUTAL DIRECTNESS, AND AN UNPRECEDENTED INSOLENCE; SOME OF THEM, IT IS TRUE, WERE DRUNK WHEN THEY CAME. SOME OF THEM WERE DAZED LIKE SAVAGES AT THE SPLENDOUR OF THE HALL, AS THEY HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT, AND SUBSIDED FOR A MINUTE GAZING AT IT OPEN-MOUTHED. THIS GREAT WHITE HALL REALLY WAS MAGNIFICENT, THOUGH THE BUILDING WAS FALLING INTO DECAY: IT WAS OF IMMENSE SIZE, WITH TWO ROWS OF WINDOWS, WITH AN OLD-FASHIONED CEILING COVERED WITH GILT CARVING, WITH A GALLERY WITH MIRRORS ON THE WALLS, RED AND WHITE DRAPERIES, MARBLE STATUES (NONDESCRIPT BUT STILL STATUES) WITH HEAVY OLD FURNITURE OF THE NAPOLEONIC PERIOD, WHITE AND GOLD, UPHOLSTERED IN RED VELVET. AT THE MOMENT I AM DESCRIBING, A HIGH PLATFORM HAD BEEN PUT UP FOR THE LITERARY GENTLEMEN WHO WERE TO READ, AND THE WHOLE HALL WAS FILLED WITH CHAIRS LIKE THE PARTERRE OF A THEATRE WITH WIDE AISLES FOR THE AUDIENCE.

BUT AFTER THE FIRST MOMENTS OF SURPRISE THE MOST SENSELESS QUESTIONS AND PROTESTS FOLLOWED. ‚ÄÚPERHAPS WE DON‚ÄÔT CARE FOR A READING.‚Ä¶ WE‚ÄÔVE PAID OUR MONEY.‚Ä¶ THE AUDIENCE HAS BEEN IMPUDENTLY SWINDLED.‚Ä¶ THIS IS OUR ENTERTAINMENT, NOT THE LEMBKES!‚ÄÙ THEY SEEMED, IN FACT, TO HAVE BEEN LET IN FOR THIS PURPOSE. I REMEMBER SPECIALLY AN ENCOUNTER IN WHICH THE PRINCELING WITH THE STAND-UP COLLAR AND THE FACE OF A DUTCH DOLL, WHOM I HAD MET THE MORNING BEFORE AT YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS, DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF. HE HAD, AT HER URGENT REQUEST, CONSENTED TO PIN A ROSETTE ON HIS LEFT SHOULDER AND TO BECOME ONE OF OUR STEWARDS. IT TURNED OUT THAT THIS DUMB WAX FIGURE COULD ACT AFTER A FASHION OF HIS OWN, IF HE COULD NOT TALK. WHEN A COLOSSAL POCKMARKED CAPTAIN, SUPPORTED BY A HERD OF RABBLE FOLLOWING AT HIS HEELS, PESTERED HIM BY ASKING ‚ÄÚWHICH WAY TO THE BUFFET?‚ÄÙ HE MADE A SIGN TO A POLICE SERGEANT. HIS HINT WAS PROMPTLY ACTED UPON, AND IN SPITE OF THE DRUNKEN CAPTAIN‚ÄÔS ABUSE HE WAS DRAGGED OUT OF THE HALL. MEANTIME THE GENUINE PUBLIC BEGAN TO MAKE ITS APPEARANCE, AND STRETCHED IN THREE LONG FILES BETWEEN THE CHAIRS. THE DISORDERLY ELEMENTS BEGAN TO SUBSIDE, BUT THE PUBLIC, EVEN THE MOST ‚ÄÚRESPECTABLE‚ÄÙ AMONG THEM, HAD A DISSATISFIED AND PERPLEXED AIR; SOME OF THE LADIES LOOKED POSITIVELY SCARED.

AT LAST ALL WERE SEATED; THE MUSIC CEASED. PEOPLE BEGAN BLOWING THEIR NOSES AND LOOKING ABOUT THEM. THEY WAITED WITH TOO SOLEMN AN AIR‚ÄÎWHICH IS ALWAYS A BAD SIGN. BUT NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN YET OF THE LEMBKES. SILKS, VELVETS, DIAMONDS GLOWED AND SPARKLED ON EVERY SIDE; WHIFFS OF FRAGRANCE FILLED THE AIR. THE MEN WERE WEARING ALL THEIR DECORATIONS, AND THE OLD MEN WERE EVEN IN UNIFORM. AT LAST THE MARSHAL‚ÄÔS WIFE CAME IN WITH LIZA. LIZA HAD NEVER BEEN SO DAZZLINGLY CHARMING OR SO SPLENDIDLY DRESSED AS THAT MORNING. HER HAIR WAS DONE UP IN CURLS, HER EYES SPARKLED, A SMILE BEAMED ON HER FACE. SHE MADE AN UNMISTAKABLE SENSATION: PEOPLE SCRUTINISED HER AND WHISPERED ABOUT HER. THEY SAID THAT SHE WAS LOOKING FOR STAVROGIN, BUT NEITHER STAVROGIN NOR VARVARA PETROVNA WERE THERE. AT THE TIME I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE: WHY WAS THERE SO MUCH HAPPINESS, SUCH JOY, SUCH ENERGY AND STRENGTH IN THAT FACE? I REMEMBERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED THE DAY BEFORE AND COULD NOT MAKE IT OUT.

BUT STILL THE LEMBKES DID NOT COME. THIS WAS DISTINCTLY A BLUNDER. I LEARNED THAT YULIA MIHAILOVNA WAITED TILL THE LAST MINUTE FOR PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WITHOUT WHOM SHE COULD NOT STIR A STEP, THOUGH SHE NEVER ADMITTED IT TO HERSELF. I MUST MENTION, IN PARENTHESIS, THAT ON THE PREVIOUS DAY PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD AT THE LAST MEETING OF THE COMMITTEE DECLINED TO WEAR THE ROSETTE OF A STEWARD, WHICH HAD DISAPPOINTED HER DREADFULLY, EVEN TO THE POINT OF TEARS. TO HER SURPRISE AND, LATER ON, HER EXTREME DISCOMFITURE (TO ANTICIPATE THINGS) HE VANISHED FOR THE WHOLE MORNING AND DID NOT MAKE HIS APPEARANCE AT THE LITERARY MATIN√©E AT ALL, SO THAT NO ONE MET HIM TILL EVENING. AT LAST THE AUDIENCE BEGAN TO MANIFEST UNMISTAKABLE SIGNS OF IMPATIENCE. NO ONE APPEARED ON THE PLATFORM EITHER. THE BACK ROWS BEGAN APPLAUDING, AS IN A THEATRE. THE ELDERLY GENTLEMEN AND THE LADIES FROWNED. ‚ÄÚTHE LEMBKES ARE REALLY GIVING THEMSELVES UNBEARABLE AIRS.‚ÄÙ EVEN AMONG THE BETTER PART OF THE AUDIENCE AN ABSURD WHISPER BEGAN TO GAIN GROUND THAT PERHAPS THERE WOULD NOT BE A F√™TE AT ALL, THAT LEMBKE PERHAPS WAS REALLY UNWELL, AND SO ON AND SO ON. BUT, THANK GOD, THE LEMBKES AT LAST APPEARED, SHE WAS LEANING ON HIS ARM; I MUST CONFESS I WAS IN GREAT APPREHENSION MYSELF ABOUT THEIR APPEARANCE. BUT THE LEGENDS WERE DISPROVED, AND THE TRUTH WAS TRIUMPHANT. THE AUDIENCE SEEMED RELIEVED. LEMBKE HIMSELF SEEMED PERFECTLY WELL. EVERY ONE, I REMEMBER, WAS OF THAT OPINION, FOR IT CAN BE IMAGINED HOW MANY EYES WERE TURNED ON HIM. I MAY MENTION, AS CHARACTERISTIC OF OUR SOCIETY, THAT THERE WERE VERY FEW OF THE BETTER-CLASS PEOPLE WHO SAW REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG WITH HIM; HIS CONDUCT SEEMED TO THEM PERFECTLY NORMAL, AND SO MUCH SO THAT THE ACTION HE HAD TAKEN IN THE SQUARE THE MORNING BEFORE WAS ACCEPTED AND APPROVED.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS HOW IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FROM THE FIRST,‚ÄÙ THE HIGHER OFFICIALS DECLARED. ‚ÄÚIF A MAN BEGINS AS A PHILANTHROPIST HE HAS TO COME TO THE SAME THING IN THE END, THOUGH HE DOES NOT SEE THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF PHILANTHROPY ITSELF‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎTHAT, AT LEAST, WAS THE OPINION AT THE CLUB. THEY ONLY BLAMED HIM FOR HAVING LOST HIS TEMPER. ‚ÄÚIT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DONE MORE COOLLY, BUT THERE, HE IS A NEW MAN,‚ÄÙ SAID THE AUTHORITIES.

ALL EYES TURNED WITH EQUAL EAGERNESS TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA. OF COURSE NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO EXPECT FROM ME AN EXACT ACCOUNT IN REGARD TO ONE POINT: THAT IS A MYSTERIOUS, A FEMININE QUESTION. BUT I ONLY KNOW ONE THING: ON THE EVENING OF THE PREVIOUS DAY SHE HAD GONE INTO ANDREY ANTONOVITCH‚ÄÔS STUDY AND WAS THERE WITH HIM TILL LONG AFTER MIDNIGHT. ANDREY ANTONOVITCH WAS COMFORTED AND FORGIVEN. THE HUSBAND AND WIFE CAME TO A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING, EVERYTHING WAS FORGOTTEN, AND WHEN AT THE END OF THE INTERVIEW LEMBKE WENT DOWN ON HIS KNEES, RECALLING WITH HORROR THE FINAL INCIDENT OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT, THE EXQUISITE HAND, AND AFTER IT THE LIPS OF HIS WIFE, CHECKED THE FERVENT FLOW OF PENITENT PHRASES OF THE CHIVALROUSLY DELICATE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS LIMP WITH EMOTION. EVERY ONE COULD SEE THE HAPPINESS IN HER FACE. SHE WALKED IN WITH AN OPEN-HEARTED AIR, WEARING A MAGNIFICENT DRESS. SHE SEEMED TO BE AT THE VERY PINNACLE OF HER HEART‚ÄÔS DESIRES, THE F√™TE‚ÄÎTHE GOAL AND CROWN OF HER DIPLOMACY‚ÄÎWAS AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT. AS THEY WALKED TO THEIR SEATS IN FRONT OF THE PLATFORM, THE LEMBKES BOWED IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND RESPONDED TO GREETINGS. THEY WERE AT ONCE SURROUNDED. THE MARSHAL‚ÄÔS WIFE GOT UP TO MEET THEM.

BUT AT THAT POINT A HORRID MISUNDERSTANDING OCCURRED; THE ORCHESTRA, APROPOS OF NOTHING, STRUCK UP A FLOURISH, NOT A TRIUMPHAL MARCH OF ANY KIND, BUT A SIMPLE FLOURISH SUCH AS WAS PLAYED AT THE CLUB WHEN SOME ONE‚ÄÔS HEALTH WAS DRUNK AT AN OFFICIAL DINNER. I KNOW NOW THAT LYAMSHIN, IN HIS CAPACITY OF STEWARD, HAD ARRANGED THIS, AS THOUGH IN HONOUR OF THE LEMBKES‚ÄÔ ENTRANCE. OF COURSE HE COULD ALWAYS EXCUSE IT AS A BLUNDER OR EXCESSIVE ZEAL.‚Ä¶ ALAS! I DID NOT KNOW AT THE TIME THAT THEY NO LONGER CARED EVEN TO FIND EXCUSES, AND THAT ALL SUCH CONSIDERATIONS WERE FROM THAT DAY A THING OF THE PAST. BUT THE FLOURISH WAS NOT THE END OF IT: IN THE MIDST OF THE VEXATIOUS ASTONISHMENT AND THE SMILES OF THE AUDIENCE THERE WAS A SUDDEN ‚ÄÚHURRAH‚ÄÙ FROM THE END OF THE HALL AND FROM THE GALLERY ALSO, APPARENTLY IN LEMBKE‚ÄÔS HONOUR. THE HURRAHS WERE FEW, BUT I MUST CONFESS THEY LASTED FOR SOME TIME. YULIA MIHAILOVNA FLUSHED, HER EYES FLASHED. LEMBKE STOOD STILL AT HIS CHAIR, AND TURNING TOWARDS THE VOICES STERNLY AND MAJESTICALLY SCANNED THE AUDIENCE.‚Ä¶ THEY HASTENED TO MAKE HIM SIT DOWN. I NOTICED WITH DISMAY THE SAME DANGEROUS SMILE ON HIS FACE AS HE HAD WORN THE MORNING BEFORE, IN HIS WIFE‚ÄÔS DRAWING-ROOM, WHEN HE STARED AT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH BEFORE GOING UP TO HIM. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT NOW, TOO, THERE WAS AN OMINOUS, AND, WORST OF ALL, A RATHER COMIC EXPRESSION ON HIS COUNTENANCE, THE EXPRESSION OF A MAN RESIGNED TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF TO SATISFY HIS WIFE‚ÄÔS LOFTY AIMS.‚Ä¶ YULIA MIHAILOVNA BECKONED TO ME HURRIEDLY, AND WHISPERED TO ME TO RUN TO KARMAZINOV AND ENTREAT HIM TO BEGIN. AND NO SOONER HAD I TURNED AWAY THAN ANOTHER DISGRACEFUL INCIDENT, MUCH MORE UNPLEASANT THAN THE FIRST, TOOK PLACE.

ON THE PLATFORM, THE EMPTY PLATFORM, ON WHICH TILL THAT MOMENT ALL EYES AND ALL EXPECTATIONS WERE FASTENED, AND WHERE NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN BUT A SMALL TABLE, A CHAIR IN FRONT OF IT, AND ON THE TABLE A GLASS OF WATER ON A SILVER SALVER‚ÄÎON THE EMPTY PLATFORM THERE SUDDENLY APPEARED THE COLOSSAL FIGURE OF CAPTAIN LEBYADKIN WEARING A DRESS-COAT AND A WHITE TIE. I WAS SO ASTOUNDED I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES. THE CAPTAIN SEEMED CONFUSED AND REMAINED STANDING AT THE BACK OF THE PLATFORM. SUDDENLY THERE WAS A SHOUT IN THE AUDIENCE, ‚ÄÚLEBYADKIN! YOU?‚ÄÙ THE CAPTAIN‚ÄÔS STUPID RED FACE (HE WAS HOPELESSLY DRUNK) EXPANDED IN A BROAD VACANT GRIN AT THIS GREETING. HE RAISED HIS HAND, RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD WITH IT, SHOOK HIS SHAGGY HEAD AND, AS THOUGH MAKING UP HIS MIND TO GO THROUGH WITH IT, TOOK TWO STEPS FORWARD AND SUDDENLY WENT OFF INTO A SERIES OF PROLONGED, BLISSFUL, GURGLING, BUT NOT LOUD GUFFAWS, WHICH MADE HIM SCREW UP HIS EYES AND SET ALL HIS BULKY PERSON HEAVING. THIS SPECTACLE SET ALMOST HALF THE AUDIENCE LAUGHING, TWENTY PEOPLE APPLAUDED. THE SERIOUS PART OF THE AUDIENCE LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER GLOOMILY; IT ALL LASTED ONLY HALF A MINUTE, HOWEVER. LIPUTIN, WEARING HIS STEWARD‚ÄÔS ROSETTE, RAN ON TO THE PLATFORM WITH TWO SERVANTS; THEY CAREFULLY TOOK THE CAPTAIN BY BOTH ARMS, WHILE LIPUTIN WHISPERED SOMETHING TO HIM. THE CAPTAIN SCOWLED, MUTTERED ‚ÄÚAH, WELL, IF THAT‚ÄÔS IT!‚ÄÙ WAVED HIS HAND, TURNED HIS HUGE BACK TO THE PUBLIC AND VANISHED WITH HIS ESCORT. BUT A MINUTE LATER LIPUTIN SKIPPED ON TO THE PLATFORM AGAIN. HE WAS WEARING THE SWEETEST OF HIS INVARIABLE SMILES, WHICH USUALLY SUGGESTED VINEGAR AND SUGAR, AND CARRIED IN HIS HANDS A SHEET OF NOTE-PAPER. WITH TINY BUT RAPID STEPS HE CAME FORWARD TO THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM.

‚ÄÚLADIES AND GENTLEMEN,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, ADDRESSING THE PUBLIC, ‚ÄÚTHROUGH OUR INADVERTENCY THERE HAS ARISEN A COMICAL MISUNDERSTANDING WHICH HAS BEEN REMOVED; BUT I‚ÄÔVE HOPEFULLY UNDERTAKEN TO DO SOMETHING AT THE EARNEST AND MOST RESPECTFUL REQUEST OF ONE OF OUR LOCAL POETS. DEEPLY TOUCHED BY THE HUMANE AND LOFTY OBJECT ‚Ä¶ IN SPITE OF HIS APPEARANCE ‚Ä¶ THE OBJECT WHICH HAS BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER ‚Ä¶ TO WIPE AWAY THE TEARS OF THE POOR BUT WELL-EDUCATED GIRLS OF OUR PROVINCE ‚Ä¶ THIS GENTLEMAN, I MEAN THIS LOCAL POET ‚Ä¶ ALTHOUGH DESIROUS OF PRESERVING HIS INCOGNITO, WOULD GLADLY HAVE HEARD HIS POEM READ AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BALL ‚Ä¶ THAT IS, I MEAN, OF THE MATIN√©E. THOUGH THIS POEM IS NOT IN THE PROGRAMME ‚Ä¶ FOR IT HAS ONLY BEEN RECEIVED HALF AN HOUR AGO ‚Ä¶ YET IT HAS SEEMED TO US‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎ(US? WHOM DID HE MEAN BY US? I REPORT HIS CONFUSED AND INCOHERENT SPEECH WORD FOR WORD)‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚTHAT THROUGH ITS REMARKABLE NA√ØVET√© OF FEELING, TOGETHER WITH ITS EQUALLY REMARKABLE GAIETY, THE POEM MIGHT WELL BE READ, THAT IS, NOT AS SOMETHING SERIOUS, BUT AS SOMETHING APPROPRIATE TO THE OCCASION, THAT IS TO THE IDEA ‚Ä¶ ESPECIALLY AS SOME LINES ‚Ä¶ AND I WANTED TO ASK THE KIND PERMISSION OF THE AUDIENCE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚREAD IT!‚ÄÙ BOOMED A VOICE AT THE BACK OF THE HALL.

‚ÄÚTHEN I AM TO READ IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚREAD IT, READ IT!‚ÄÙ CRIED MANY VOICES.

‚ÄÚWITH THE PERMISSION OF THE AUDIENCE I WILL READ IT,‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN MINCED AGAIN, STILL WITH THE SAME SUGARY SMILE. HE STILL SEEMED TO HESITATE, AND I EVEN THOUGHT THAT HE WAS RATHER EXCITED. THESE PEOPLE ARE SOMETIMES NERVOUS IN SPITE OF THEIR IMPUDENCE. A DIVINITY STUDENT WOULD HAVE CARRIED IT THROUGH WITHOUT WINKING, BUT LIPUTIN DID, AFTER ALL, BELONG TO THE LAST GENERATION.

‚ÄÚI MUST SAY, THAT IS, I HAVE THE HONOUR TO SAY BY WAY OF PREFACE, THAT IT IS NOT PRECISELY AN ODE SUCH AS USED TO BE WRITTEN FOR F√™TES, BUT IS RATHER, SO TO SAY, A JEST, BUT FULL OF UNDOUBTED FEELING, TOGETHER WITH PLAYFUL HUMOUR, AND, SO TO SAY, THE MOST REALISTIC TRUTHFULNESS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚREAD IT, READ IT!‚ÄÙ

HE UNFOLDED THE PAPER. NO ONE OF COURSE WAS IN TIME TO STOP HIM. BESIDES, HE WAS WEARING HIS STEWARD‚ÄÔS BADGE. IN A RINGING VOICE HE DECLAIMED:

‚ÄÚTO THE LOCAL GOVERNESSES OF THE FATHERLAND FROM THE POET AT THE F√™TE:

     ‚ÄÚGOVERNESSES ALL, GOOD MORROW,
     TRIUMPH ON THIS FESTIVE DAY.
     RETROGRADE OR VOWED GEORGE-SANDER‚ÄÎ
     NEVER MIND, JUST FRISK AWAY!‚ÄÙ
‚ÄÚBUT THAT‚ÄÔS LEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS! LEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS!‚ÄÙ CRIED SEVERAL VOICES. THERE WAS LAUGHTER AND EVEN APPLAUSE, THOUGH NOT FROM VERY MANY.

     ‚ÄÚTEACHING FRENCH TO WET-NOSED CHILDREN,
     YOU ARE GLAD ENOUGH TO THINK
     YOU CAN CATCH A WORN-OUT SEXTON‚ÄÎ
     EVEN HE IS WORTH A WINK!‚ÄÙ
‚ÄÚHURRAH! HURRAH!‚ÄÙ

     ‚ÄÚBUT IN THESE GREAT DAYS OF PROGRESS,
     LADIES, TO YOUR SORROW KNOW,
     YOU CAN‚ÄÔT EVEN CATCH A SEXTON,
     IF YOU HAVE NOT GOT A ‚ÄÒDOT‚ÄÔ.‚ÄÙ
‚ÄÚTO BE SURE, TO BE SURE, THAT‚ÄÔS REALISM. YOU CAN‚ÄÔT HOOK A HUSBAND WITHOUT A ‚ÄÒDOT‚ÄÔ!‚ÄÙ

     ‚ÄÚBUT, HENCEFORTH, SINCE THROUGH OUR FEASTING
     CAPITAL HAS FLOWED FROM ALL,
     AND WE SEND YOU FORTH TO CONQUEST
     DANCING, DOWRIED FROM THIS HALL‚ÄÎ
     RETROGRADE OR VOWED GEORGE-SANDER,
     NEVER MIND, REJOICE YOU MAY,
     YOU‚ÄÔRE A GOVERNESS WITH A DOWRY,
     SPIT ON ALL AND FRISK AWAY!‚ÄÙ
I MUST CONFESS I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EARS. THE INSOLENCE OF IT WAS SO UNMISTAKABLE THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF EXCUSING LIPUTIN ON THE GROUND OF STUPIDITY. BESIDES, LIPUTIN WAS BY NO MEANS STUPID. THE INTENTION WAS OBVIOUS, TO ME, ANYWAY; THEY SEEMED IN A HURRY TO CREATE DISORDER. SOME LINES IN THESE IDIOTIC VERSES, FOR INSTANCE THE LAST, WERE SUCH THAT NO STUPIDITY COULD HAVE LET THEM PASS. LIPUTIN HIMSELF SEEMED TO FEEL THAT HE HAD UNDERTAKEN TOO MUCH; WHEN HE HAD ACHIEVED HIS EXPLOIT HE WAS SO OVERCOME BY HIS OWN IMPUDENCE THAT HE DID NOT EVEN LEAVE THE PLATFORM BUT REMAINED STANDING, AS THOUGH THERE WERE SOMETHING MORE HE WANTED TO SAY. HE HAD PROBABLY IMAGINED THAT IT WOULD SOMEHOW PRODUCE A DIFFERENT EFFECT; BUT EVEN THE GROUP OF RUFFIANS WHO HAD APPLAUDED DURING THE READING SUDDENLY SANK INTO SILENCE, AS THOUGH THEY, TOO, WERE OVERCOME. WHAT WAS SILLIEST OF ALL, MANY OF THEM TOOK THE WHOLE EPISODE SERIOUSLY, THAT IS, DID NOT REGARD THE VERSES AS A LAMPOON BUT ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT REALISTIC AND TRUE AS REGARDS THE GOVERNESSES‚ÄÎA POEM WITH A TENDENCY, IN FACT. BUT THE EXCESSIVE FREEDOM OF THE VERSES STRUCK EVEN THEM AT LAST; AS FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC THEY WERE NOT ONLY SCANDALISED BUT OBVIOUSLY OFFENDED. I AM SURE I AM NOT MISTAKEN AS TO THE IMPRESSION. YULIA MIHAILOVNA SAID AFTERWARDS THAT IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO A SWOON. ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTABLE OLD GENTLEMEN HELPED HIS OLD WIFE ON TO HER FEET, AND THEY WALKED OUT OF THE HALL ACCOMPANIED BY THE AGITATED GLANCES OF THE AUDIENCE. WHO KNOWS, THE EXAMPLE MIGHT HAVE INFECTED OTHERS IF KARMAZINOV HIMSELF, WEARING A DRESS-COAT AND A WHITE TIE AND CARRYING A MANUSCRIPT, IN HIS HAND, HAD NOT APPEARED ON THE PLATFORM AT THAT MOMENT. YULIA MIHAILOVNA TURNED AN ECSTATIC GAZE AT HIM AS ON HER DELIVERER.‚Ä¶ BUT I WAS BY THAT TIME BEHIND THE SCENES. I WAS IN QUEST OF LIPUTIN.

‚ÄÚYOU DID THAT ON PURPOSE!‚ÄÙ I SAID, SEIZING HIM INDIGNANTLY BY THE ARM.

‚ÄÚI ASSURE YOU I NEVER THOUGHT ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HE BEGAN, CRINGING AND LYING AT ONCE, PRETENDING TO BE UNHAPPY. ‚ÄÚTHE VERSES HAD ONLY JUST BEEN BROUGHT AND I THOUGHT THAT AS AN AMUSING PLEASANTRY.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU DID NOT THINK ANYTHING OF THE SORT. YOU CAN‚ÄÔT REALLY THINK THAT STUPID RUBBISH AN AMUSING PLEASANTRY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, I DO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE SIMPLY LYING, AND IT WASN‚ÄÔT BROUGHT TO YOU JUST NOW. YOU HELPED LEBYADKIN TO COMPOSE IT YOURSELF, YESTERDAY VERY LIKELY, TO CREATE A SCANDAL. THE LAST VERSE MUST HAVE BEEN YOURS, THE PART ABOUT THE SEXTON TOO. WHY DID HE COME ON IN A DRESS-COAT? YOU MUST HAVE MEANT HIM TO READ IT, TOO, IF HE HAD NOT BEEN DRUNK?‚ÄÙ

LIPUTIN LOOKED AT ME COLDLY AND IRONICALLY.

‚ÄÚWHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF YOURS?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED SUDDENLY WITH STRANGE CALM.

‚ÄÚWHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF MINE? YOU ARE WEARING THE STEWARD‚ÄÔS BADGE, TOO.‚Ä¶ WHERE IS PYOTR STEPANOVITCH?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT KNOW, SOMEWHERE HERE; WHY DO YOU ASK?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBECAUSE NOW I SEE THROUGH IT. IT‚ÄÔS SIMPLY A PLOT AGAINST YULIA MIHAILOVNA SO AS TO RUIN THE DAY BY A SCANDAL.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

LIPUTIN LOOKED AT ME ASKANCE AGAIN.

‚ÄÚBUT WHAT IS IT TO YOU?‚ÄÙ HE SAID, GRINNING. HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND WALKED AWAY.

IT CAME OVER ME WITH A RUSH. ALL MY SUSPICIONS WERE CONFIRMED. TILL THEN, I HAD BEEN HOPING I WAS MISTAKEN! WHAT WAS I TO DO? I WAS ON THE POINT OF ASKING THE ADVICE OF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, BUT HE WAS STANDING BEFORE THE LOOKING-GLASS, TRYING ON DIFFERENT SMILES, AND CONTINUALLY CONSULTING A PIECE OF PAPER ON WHICH HE HAD NOTES. HE HAD TO GO ON IMMEDIATELY AFTER KARMAZINOV, AND WAS NOT IN A FIT STATE FOR CONVERSATION. SHOULD I RUN TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA? BUT IT WAS TOO SOON TO GO TO HER: SHE NEEDED A MUCH STERNER LESSON TO CURE HER OF HER CONVICTION THAT SHE HAD ‚ÄÚA FOLLOWING,‚ÄÙ AND THAT EVERY ONE WAS ‚ÄÚFANATICALLY DEVOTED‚ÄÙ TO HER. SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED ME, AND WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I WAS DREAMING. BESIDES, WHAT HELP COULD SHE BE? ‚ÄÚEH,‚ÄÙ I THOUGHT, ‚ÄÚAFTER ALL, WHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF MINE? I‚ÄÔLL TAKE OFF MY BADGE AND GO HOME WHEN IT BEGINS.‚ÄÙ THAT WAS MY MENTAL PHRASE, ‚ÄÚWHEN IT BEGINS‚ÄÙ; I REMEMBER IT.

BUT I HAD TO GO AND LISTEN TO KARMAZINOV. TAKING A LAST LOOK ROUND BEHIND THE SCENES, I NOTICED THAT A GOOD NUMBER OF OUTSIDERS, EVEN WOMEN AMONG THEM, WERE FLITTING ABOUT, GOING IN AND OUT. ‚ÄÚBEHIND THE SCENES‚ÄÙ WAS RATHER A NARROW SPACE COMPLETELY SCREENED FROM THE AUDIENCE BY A CURTAIN AND COMMUNICATING WITH OTHER ROOMS BY MEANS OF A PASSAGE. HERE OUR READERS WERE AWAITING THEIR TURNS. BUT I WAS STRUCK AT THAT MOMENT BY THE READER WHO WAS TO FOLLOW STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. HE, TOO, WAS SOME SORT OF PROFESSOR (I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW TO THIS DAY EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS) WHO HAD VOLUNTARILY LEFT SOME EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION AFTER A DISTURBANCE AMONG THE STUDENTS, AND HAD ARRIVED IN THE TOWN ONLY A FEW DAYS BEFORE. HE, TOO, HAD BEEN RECOMMENDED TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA, AND SHE HAD RECEIVED HIM WITH REVERENCE. I KNOW NOW THAT HE HAD ONLY SPENT ONE EVENING IN HER COMPANY BEFORE THE READING; HE HAD NOT SPOKEN ALL THAT EVENING, HAD LISTENED WITH AN EQUIVOCAL SMILE TO THE JESTS AND THE GENERAL TONE OF THE COMPANY SURROUNDING YULIA MIHAILOVNA, AND HAD MADE AN UNPLEASANT IMPRESSION ON EVERY ONE BY HIS AIR OF HAUGHTINESS, AND AT THE SAME TIME ALMOST TIMOROUS READINESS TO TAKE OFFENCE. IT WAS YULIA MIHAILOVNA HERSELF WHO HAD ENLISTED HIS SERVICES. NOW HE WAS WALKING FROM CORNER TO CORNER, AND, LIKE STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, WAS MUTTERING TO HIMSELF, THOUGH HE LOOKED ON THE GROUND INSTEAD OF IN THE LOOKING-GLASS. HE WAS NOT TRYING ON SMILES, THOUGH HE OFTEN SMILED RAPACIOUSLY. IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT IT WAS USELESS TO SPEAK TO HIM EITHER. HE LOOKED ABOUT FORTY, WAS SHORT AND BALD, HAD A GREYISH BEARD, AND WAS DECENTLY DRESSED. BUT WHAT WAS MOST INTERESTING ABOUT HIM WAS THAT AT EVERY TURN HE TOOK HE THREW UP HIS RIGHT FIST, BRANDISHED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AND SUDDENLY BROUGHT IT DOWN AGAIN AS THOUGH CRUSHING AN ANTAGONIST TO ATOMS. HE WENT THROUGH THIS BY-PLAY EVERY MOMENT. IT MADE ME UNCOMFORTABLE. I HASTENED AWAY TO LISTEN TO KARMAZINOV.

III

THERE WAS A FEELING IN THE HALL THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG AGAIN. LET ME STATE TO BEGIN WITH THAT I HAVE THE DEEPEST REVERENCE FOR GENIUS, BUT WHY DO OUR GENIUSES IN THE DECLINE OF THEIR ILLUSTRIOUS YEARS BEHAVE SOMETIMES EXACTLY LIKE LITTLE BOYS? WHAT THOUGH HE WAS KARMAZINOV, AND CAME FORWARD WITH AS MUCH DIGNITY AS FIVE KAMMERHERRS ROLLED INTO ONE? HOW COULD HE EXPECT TO KEEP AN AUDIENCE LIKE OURS LISTENING FOR A WHOLE HOUR TO A SINGLE PAPER? I HAVE OBSERVED, IN FACT, THAT HOWEVER BIG A GENIUS A MAN MAY BE, HE CAN‚ÄÔT MONOPOLISE THE ATTENTION OF AN AUDIENCE AT A FRIVOLOUS LITERARY MATIN√©E FOR MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES WITH IMPUNITY. THE ENTRANCE OF THE GREAT WRITER WAS RECEIVED, INDEED, WITH THE UTMOST RESPECT: EVEN THE SEVEREST ELDERLY MEN SHOWED SIGNS OF APPROVAL AND INTEREST, AND THE LADIES EVEN DISPLAYED SOME ENTHUSIASM. THE APPLAUSE WAS BRIEF, HOWEVER, AND SOMEHOW UNCERTAIN AND NOT UNANIMOUS. YET THERE WAS NO UNSEEMLY BEHAVIOUR IN THE BACK ROWS, TILL KARMAZINOV BEGAN TO SPEAK, NOT THAT ANYTHING VERY BAD FOLLOWED THEN, BUT ONLY A SORT OF MISUNDERSTANDING. I HAVE MENTIONED ALREADY THAT HE HAD RATHER A SHRILL VOICE, ALMOST FEMININE IN FACT, AND AT THE SAME TIME A GENUINELY ARISTOCRATIC LISP. HE HAD HARDLY ARTICULATED A FEW WORDS WHEN SOMEONE HAD THE EFFRONTERY TO LAUGH ALOUD‚ÄÎPROBABLY SOME IGNORANT SIMPLETON WHO KNEW NOTHING OF THE WORLD, AND WAS CONGENITALLY DISPOSED TO LAUGHTER. BUT THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE A HOSTILE DEMONSTRATION; ON THE CONTRARY PEOPLE SAID ‚ÄÚSH-H!‚ÄÙ AND THE OFFENDER WAS CRUSHED. BUT MR. KARMAZINOV, WITH AN AFFECTED AIR AND INTONATION, ANNOUNCED THAT ‚ÄÚAT FIRST HE HAD DECLINED ABSOLUTELY TO READ.‚ÄÙ (MUCH NEED THERE WAS TO MENTION IT!) ‚ÄÚTHERE ARE SOME LINES WHICH COME SO DEEPLY FROM THE HEART THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UTTER THEM ALOUD, SO THAT THESE HOLY THINGS CANNOT BE LAID BEFORE THE PUBLIC‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎ(WHY LAY THEM THEN?)‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚBUT AS HE HAD BEEN BEGGED TO DO SO, HE WAS DOING SO, AND AS HE WAS, MOREOVER, LAYING DOWN HIS PEN FOREVER, AND HAD SWORN TO WRITE NO MORE, HE HAD WRITTEN THIS LAST FAREWELL; AND AS HE HAD SWORN NEVER, ON ANY INDUCEMENT, TO READ ANYTHING IN PUBLIC,‚ÄÙ AND SO ON, AND SO ON, ALL IN THAT STYLE.

BUT ALL THAT WOULD NOT HAVE MATTERED; EVERY ONE KNOWS WHAT AUTHORS‚ÄÔ PREFACES ARE LIKE, THOUGH, I MAY OBSERVE, THAT CONSIDERING THE LACK OF CULTURE OF OUR AUDIENCE AND THE IRRITABILITY OF THE BACK ROWS, ALL THIS MAY HAVE HAD AN INFLUENCE. SURELY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE READ A LITTLE STORY, A SHORT TALE SUCH AS HE HAD WRITTEN IN THE PAST‚ÄÎOVER-ELABORATE, THAT IS, AND AFFECTED, BUT SOMETIMES WITTY. IT WOULD HAVE SAVED THE SITUATION. NO, THIS WAS QUITE ANOTHER STORY! IT WAS A REGULAR ORATION! GOOD HEAVENS, WHAT WASN‚ÄÔT THERE IN IT! I AM POSITIVE THAT IT WOULD HAVE REDUCED TO RIGIDITY EVEN A PETERSBURG AUDIENCE, LET ALONE OURS. IMAGINE AN ARTICLE THAT WOULD HAVE FILLED SOME THIRTY PAGES OF PRINT OF THE MOST AFFECTED, AIMLESS PRATTLE; AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THE GENTLEMAN READ IT WITH A SORT OF MELANCHOLY CONDESCENSION AS THOUGH IT WERE A FAVOUR, SO THAT IT WAS ALMOST INSULTING TO THE AUDIENCE. THE SUBJECT.‚Ä¶ WHO COULD MAKE IT OUT? IT WAS A SORT OF DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN IMPRESSIONS AND REMINISCENCES. BUT OF WHAT? AND ABOUT WHAT? THOUGH THE LEADING INTELLECTS OF THE PROVINCE DID THEIR UTMOST DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE READING, THEY COULD MAKE NOTHING OF IT, AND THEY LISTENED TO THE SECOND PART SIMPLY OUT OF POLITENESS. A GREAT DEAL WAS SAID ABOUT LOVE, INDEED, OF THE LOVE OF THE GENIUS FOR SOME PERSON, BUT I MUST ADMIT IT MADE RATHER AN AWKWARD IMPRESSION. FOR THE GREAT WRITER TO TELL US ABOUT HIS FIRST KISS SEEMED TO MY MIND A LITTLE INCONGRUOUS WITH HIS SHORT AND FAT LITTLE FIGURE ‚Ä¶ ANOTHER THING THAT WAS OFFENSIVE; THESE KISSES DID NOT OCCUR AS THEY DO WITH THE REST OF MANKIND. THERE HAD TO BE A FRAMEWORK OF GORSE (IT HAD TO BE GORSE OR SOME SUCH PLANT THAT ONE MUST LOOK UP IN A FLORA) AND THERE HAD TO BE A TINT OF PURPLE IN THE SKY, SUCH AS NO MORTAL HAD EVER OBSERVED BEFORE, OR IF SOME PEOPLE HAD SEEN IT, THEY HAD NEVER NOTICED IT, BUT HE SEEMED TO SAY, ‚ÄÚI HAVE SEEN IT AND AM DESCRIBING IT TO YOU, FOOLS, AS IF IT WERE A MOST ORDINARY THING.‚ÄÙ THE TREE UNDER WHICH THE INTERESTING COUPLE SAT HAD OF COURSE TO BE OF AN ORANGE COLOUR. THEY WERE SITTING SOMEWHERE IN GERMANY. SUDDENLY THEY SEE POMPEY OR CASSIUS ON THE EVE OF A BATTLE, AND BOTH ARE PENETRATED BY A THRILL OF ECSTASY. SOME WOOD-NYMPH SQUEAKED IN THE BUSHES. GLUCK PLAYED THE VIOLIN AMONG THE REEDS. THE TITLE OF THE PIECE HE WAS PLAYING WAS GIVEN IN FULL, BUT NO ONE KNEW IT, SO THAT ONE WOULD HAVE HAD TO LOOK IT UP IN A MUSICAL DICTIONARY. MEANWHILE A FOG CAME ON, SUCH A FOG, SUCH A FOG, THAT IT WAS MORE LIKE A MILLION PILLOWS THAN A FOG. AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING DISAPPEARS AND THE GREAT GENIUS IS CROSSING THE FROZEN VOLGA IN A THAW. TWO AND A HALF PAGES ARE FILLED WITH THE CROSSING, AND YET HE FALLS THROUGH THE ICE. THE GENIUS IS DROWNING‚ÄÎYOU IMAGINE HE WAS DROWNED? NOT A BIT OF IT; THIS WAS SIMPLY IN ORDER THAT WHEN HE WAS DROWNING AND AT HIS LAST GASP, HE MIGHT CATCH SIGHT OF A BIT OF ICE, THE SIZE OF A PEA, BUT PURE AND CRYSTAL ‚ÄÚAS A FROZEN TEAR,‚ÄÙ AND IN THAT TEAR WAS REFLECTED GERMANY, OR MORE ACCURATELY THE SKY OF GERMANY, AND ITS IRIDESCENT SPARKLE RECALLED TO HIS MIND THE VERY TEAR WHICH ‚ÄÚDOST THOU REMEMBER, FELL FROM THINE EYES WHEN WE WERE SITTING UNDER THAT EMERALD TREE, AND THOU DIDST CRY OUT JOYFULLY: ‚ÄÒTHERE IS NO CRIME!‚ÄÔ ‚ÄÒNO,‚ÄÔ I SAID THROUGH MY TEARS, ‚ÄÒBUT IF THAT IS SO, THERE ARE NO RIGHTEOUS EITHER.‚ÄÔ WE SOBBED AND PARTED FOREVER.‚ÄÙ SHE WENT OFF SOMEWHERE TO THE SEA COAST, WHILE HE WENT TO VISIT SOME CAVES, AND THEN HE DESCENDS AND DESCENDS AND DESCENDS FOR THREE YEARS UNDER SUHAREV TOWER IN MOSCOW, AND SUDDENLY IN THE VERY BOWELS OF THE EARTH, HE FINDS IN A CAVE A LAMP, AND BEFORE THE LAMP A HERMIT. THE HERMIT IS PRAYING. THE GENIUS LEANS AGAINST A LITTLE BARRED WINDOW, AND SUDDENLY HEARS A SIGH. DO YOU SUPPOSE IT WAS THE HERMIT SIGHING? MUCH HE CARES ABOUT THE HERMIT! NOT A BIT OF IT, THIS SIGH SIMPLY REMINDS HIM OF HER FIRST SIGH, THIRTY-SEVEN YEARS BEFORE, ‚ÄÚIN GERMANY, WHEN, DOST THOU REMEMBER, WE SAT UNDER AN AGATE TREE AND THOU DIDST SAY TO ME, ‚ÄÒWHY LOVE? SEE OCHRA IS GROWING ALL AROUND AND I LOVE THEE; BUT THE OCHRA WILL CEASE TO GROW, AND I SHALL CEASE TO LOVE.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ THEN THE FOG COMES ON AGAIN, HOFFMAN APPEARS ON THE SCENE, THE WOOD-NYMPH WHISTLES A TUNE FROM CHOPIN, AND SUDDENLY OUT OF THE FOG APPEARS ANCUS MARCIUS OVER THE ROOFS OF ROME, WEARING A LAUREL WREATH. ‚ÄÚA CHILL OF ECSTASY RAN DOWN OUR BACKS AND WE PARTED FOREVER‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND SO ON AND SO ON.

PERHAPS I AM NOT REPORTING IT QUITE RIGHT AND DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HOW TO REPORT IT, BUT THE DRIFT OF THE BABBLE WAS SOMETHING OF THAT SORT. AND AFTER ALL, HOW DISGRACEFUL THIS PASSION OF OUR GREAT INTELLECTS FOR JESTING IN A SUPERIOR WAY REALLY IS! THE GREAT EUROPEAN PHILOSOPHER, THE GREAT MAN OF SCIENCE, THE INVENTOR, THE MARTYR‚ÄÎALL THESE WHO LABOUR AND ARE HEAVY LADEN, ARE TO THE GREAT RUSSIAN GENIUS NO MORE THAN SO MANY COOKS IN HIS KITCHEN. HE IS THE MASTER AND THEY COME TO HIM, CAP IN HAND, AWAITING ORDERS. IT IS TRUE HE JEERS SUPERCILIOUSLY AT RUSSIA TOO, AND THERE IS NOTHING HE LIKES BETTER THAN EXHIBITING THE BANKRUPTCY OF RUSSIA IN EVERY RELATION BEFORE THE GREAT MINDS OF EUROPE, BUT AS REGARDS HIMSELF, NO, HE IS AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN ALL THE GREAT MINDS OF EUROPE; THEY ARE ONLY MATERIAL FOR HIS JESTS. HE TAKES ANOTHER MAN‚ÄÔS IDEA, TACKS ON TO IT ITS ANTITHESIS, AND THE EPIGRAM IS MADE. THERE IS SUCH A THING AS CRIME, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CRIME; THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS JUSTICE, THERE ARE NO JUST MEN; ATHEISM, DARWINISM, THE MOSCOW BELLS.‚Ä¶ BUT ALAS, HE NO LONGER BELIEVES IN THE MOSCOW BELLS; ROME, LAURELS.‚Ä¶ BUT HE HAS NO BELIEF IN LAURELS EVEN.‚Ä¶ WE HAVE A CONVENTIONAL ATTACK OF BYRONIC SPLEEN, A GRIMACE FROM HEINE, SOMETHING OF PETCHORIN‚ÄÎAND THE MACHINE GOES ON ROLLING, WHISTLING, AT FULL SPEED. ‚ÄÚBUT YOU MAY PRAISE ME, YOU MAY PRAISE ME, THAT I LIKE EXTREMELY; IT‚ÄÔS ONLY IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING THAT I LAY DOWN THE PEN; I SHALL BORE YOU THREE HUNDRED TIMES MORE, YOU‚ÄÔLL GROW WEARY OF READING ME.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

OF COURSE IT DID NOT END WITHOUT TROUBLE; BUT THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT IT WAS HIS OWN DOING. PEOPLE HAD FOR SOME TIME BEGUN SHUFFLING THEIR FEET, BLOWING THEIR NOSES, COUGHING, AND DOING EVERYTHING THAT PEOPLE DO WHEN A LECTURER, WHOEVER HE MAY BE, KEEPS AN AUDIENCE FOR LONGER THAN TWENTY MINUTES AT A LITERARY MATIN√©E. BUT THE GENIUS NOTICED NOTHING OF ALL THIS. HE WENT ON LISPING AND MUMBLING, WITHOUT GIVING A THOUGHT TO THE AUDIENCE, SO THAT EVERY ONE BEGAN TO WONDER. SUDDENLY IN A BACK ROW A SOLITARY BUT LOUD VOICE WAS HEARD:

‚ÄÚGOOD LORD, WHAT NONSENSE!‚ÄÙ

THE EXCLAMATION ESCAPED INVOLUNTARILY, AND I AM SURE WAS NOT INTENDED AS A DEMONSTRATION. THE MAN WAS SIMPLY WORN OUT. BUT MR. KARMAZINOV STOPPED, LOOKED SARCASTICALLY AT THE AUDIENCE, AND SUDDENLY LISPED WITH THE DEPORTMENT OF AN AGGRIEVED KAMMERHERR.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔM AFRAID I‚ÄÔVE BEEN BORING YOU DREADFULLY, GENTLEMEN?‚ÄÙ

THAT WAS HIS BLUNDER, THAT HE WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK; FOR PROVOKING AN ANSWER IN THIS WAY HE GAVE AN OPENING FOR THE RABBLE TO SPEAK, TOO, AND EVEN LEGITIMATELY, SO TO SAY, WHILE IF HE HAD RESTRAINED HIMSELF, PEOPLE WOULD HAVE GONE ON BLOWING THEIR NOSES AND IT WOULD HAVE PASSED OFF SOMEHOW. PERHAPS HE EXPECTED APPLAUSE IN RESPONSE TO HIS QUESTION, BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND OF APPLAUSE; ON THE CONTRARY, EVERY ONE SEEMED TO SUBSIDE AND SHRINK BACK IN DISMAY.

‚ÄÚYOU NEVER DID SEE ANCUS MARCIUS, THAT‚ÄÔS ALL BRAG,‚ÄÙ CRIED A VOICE THAT SOUNDED FULL OF IRRITATION AND EVEN NERVOUS EXHAUSTION.

‚ÄÚJUST SO,‚ÄÙ ANOTHER VOICE AGREED AT ONCE. ‚ÄÚTHERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS AS GHOSTS NOWADAYS, NOTHING BUT NATURAL SCIENCE. LOOK IT UP IN A SCIENTIFIC BOOK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGENTLEMEN, THERE WAS NOTHING I EXPECTED LESS THAN SUCH OBJECTIONS,‚ÄÙ SAID KARMAZINOV, EXTREMELY SURPRISED. THE GREAT GENIUS HAD COMPLETELY LOST TOUCH WITH HIS FATHERLAND IN KARLSRUHE.

‚ÄÚNOWADAYS IT‚ÄÔS OUTRAGEOUS TO SAY THAT THE WORLD STANDS ON THREE FISHES,‚ÄÙ A YOUNG LADY SNAPPED OUT SUDDENLY. ‚ÄÚYOU CAN‚ÄÔT HAVE GONE DOWN TO THE HERMIT‚ÄÔS CAVE, KARMAZINOV. AND WHO TALKS ABOUT HERMITS NOWADAYS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGENTLEMEN, WHAT SURPRISES ME MOST OF ALL IS THAT YOU TAKE IT ALL SO SERIOUSLY. HOWEVER ‚Ä¶ HOWEVER, YOU ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT. NO ONE HAS GREATER RESPECT FOR TRUTH AND REALISM THAN I HAVE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

THOUGH HE SMILED IRONICALLY HE WAS TREMENDOUSLY OVERCOME. HIS FACE SEEMED TO EXPRESS: ‚ÄÚI AM NOT THE SORT OF MAN YOU THINK, I AM ON YOUR SIDE, ONLY PRAISE ME, PRAISE ME MORE, AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, I LIKE IT EXTREMELY.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGENTLEMEN,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, COMPLETELY MORTIFIED AT LAST, ‚ÄÚI SEE THAT MY POOR POEM IS QUITE OUT OF PLACE HERE. AND, INDEED, I AM OUT OF PLACE HERE MYSELF, I THINK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU THREW AT THE CROW AND YOU HIT THE COW,‚ÄÙ SOME FOOL, PROBABLY DRUNK, SHOUTED AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE, AND OF COURSE NO NOTICE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN OF HIM. IT IS TRUE THERE WAS A SOUND OF DISRESPECTFUL LAUGHTER.

‚ÄÚA COW, YOU SAY?‚ÄÙ KARMAZINOV CAUGHT IT UP AT ONCE, HIS VOICE GREW SHRILLER AND SHRILLER. ‚ÄÚAS FOR CROWS AND COWS, GENTLEMEN, I WILL REFRAIN. I‚ÄÔVE TOO MUCH RESPECT FOR ANY AUDIENCE TO PERMIT MYSELF COMPARISONS, HOWEVER HARMLESS; BUT I DID THINK ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔD BETTER BE CAREFUL, SIR,‚ÄÙ SOMEONE SHOUTED FROM A BACK ROW.

‚ÄÚBUT I HAD SUPPOSED THAT LAYING ASIDE MY PEN AND SAYING FAREWELL TO MY READERS, I SHOULD BE HEARD ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, NO, WE WANT TO HEAR YOU, WE WANT TO,‚ÄÙ A FEW VOICES FROM THE FRONT ROW PLUCKED UP SPIRIT TO EXCLAIM AT LAST.

‚ÄÚREAD, READ!‚ÄÙ SEVERAL ENTHUSIASTIC LADIES‚ÄÔ VOICES CHIMED IN, AND AT LAST THERE WAS AN OUTBURST OF APPLAUSE, SPARSE AND FEEBLE, IT IS TRUE.

‚ÄÚBELIEVE ME, KARMAZINOV, EVERY ONE LOOKS ON IT AS AN HONOUR ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ THE MARSHAL‚ÄÔS WIFE HERSELF COULD NOT RESIST SAYING.

‚ÄÚMR. KARMAZINOV!‚ÄÙ CRIED A FRESH YOUNG VOICE IN THE BACK OF THE HALL SUDDENLY. IT WAS THE VOICE OF A VERY YOUNG TEACHER FROM THE DISTRICT SCHOOL WHO HAD ONLY LATELY COME AMONG US, AN EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN, QUIET AND GENTLEMANLY. HE STOOD UP IN HIS PLACE. ‚ÄÚMR. KARMAZINOV, IF I HAD THE HAPPINESS TO FALL IN LOVE AS YOU HAVE DESCRIBED TO US, I REALLY SHOULDN‚ÄÔT REFER TO MY LOVE IN AN ARTICLE INTENDED FOR PUBLIC READING.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HE FLUSHED RED ALL OVER.

‚ÄÚLADIES AND GENTLEMEN,‚ÄÙ CRIED KARMAZINOV, ‚ÄÚI HAVE FINISHED. I WILL OMIT THE END AND WITHDRAW. ONLY ALLOW ME TO READ THE SIX LAST LINES:

‚ÄÚYES, DEAR READER, FAREWELL!‚ÄÙ HE BEGAN AT ONCE FROM THE MANUSCRIPT WITHOUT SITTING DOWN AGAIN IN HIS CHAIR. ‚ÄÚFAREWELL, READER; I DO NOT GREATLY INSIST ON OUR PARTING FRIENDS; WHAT NEED TO TROUBLE YOU, INDEED. YOU MAY ABUSE ME, ABUSE ME AS YOU WILL IF IT AFFORDS YOU ANY SATISFACTION. BUT BEST OF ALL IF WE FORGET ONE ANOTHER FOREVER. AND IF YOU ALL, READERS, WERE SUDDENLY SO KIND AS TO FALL ON YOUR KNEES AND BEGIN BEGGING ME WITH TEARS, ‚ÄÒWRITE, OH, WRITE FOR US, KARMAZINOV‚ÄÎFOR THE SAKE OF RUSSIA, FOR THE SAKE OF POSTERITY, TO WIN LAURELS,‚ÄÔ EVEN THEN I WOULD ANSWER YOU, THANKING YOU, OF COURSE, WITH EVERY COURTESY, ‚ÄÒNO, WE‚ÄÔVE HAD ENOUGH OF ONE ANOTHER, DEAR FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN, MERCI! IT‚ÄÔS TIME WE TOOK OUR SEPARATE WAYS!‚ÄÔ MERCI, MERCI, MERCI!‚ÄÙ

KARMAZINOV BOWED CEREMONIOUSLY, AND, AS RED AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN COOKED, RETIRED BEHIND THE SCENES.

‚ÄÚNOBODY WOULD GO DOWN ON THEIR KNEES; A WILD IDEA!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT CONCEIT!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS ONLY HUMOUR,‚ÄÙ SOMEONE MORE REASONABLE SUGGESTED.

‚ÄÚSPARE ME YOUR HUMOUR.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI CALL IT IMPUDENCE, GENTLEMEN!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, HE‚ÄÔS FINISHED NOW, ANYWAY!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚECH, WHAT A DULL SHOW!‚ÄÙ

BUT ALL THESE IGNORANT EXCLAMATIONS IN THE BACK ROWS (THOUGH THEY WERE CONFINED TO THE BACK ROWS) WERE DROWNED IN APPLAUSE FROM THE OTHER HALF OF THE AUDIENCE. THEY CALLED FOR KARMAZINOV. SEVERAL LADIES WITH YULIA MIHAILOVNA AND THE MARSHAL‚ÄÔS WIFE CROWDED ROUND THE PLATFORM. IN YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS HANDS WAS A GORGEOUS LAUREL WREATH RESTING ON ANOTHER WREATH OF LIVING ROSES ON A WHITE VELVET CUSHION.

‚ÄÚLAURELS!‚ÄÙ KARMAZINOV PRONOUNCED WITH A SUBTLE AND RATHER SARCASTIC SMILE. ‚ÄÚI AM TOUCHED, OF COURSE, AND ACCEPT WITH REAL EMOTION THIS WREATH PREPARED BEFOREHAND, BUT STILL FRESH AND UNWITHERED, BUT I ASSURE YOU, MESDAMES, THAT I HAVE SUDDENLY BECOME SO REALISTIC THAT I FEEL LAURELS WOULD IN THIS AGE BE FAR MORE APPROPRIATE IN THE HANDS OF A SKILFUL COOK THAN IN MINE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, A COOK IS MORE USEFUL,‚ÄÙ CRIED THE DIVINITY STUDENT, WHO HAD BEEN AT THE ‚ÄÚMEETING‚ÄÙ AT VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS.

THERE WAS SOME DISORDER. IN MANY ROWS PEOPLE JUMPED UP TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF THE PRESENTATION OF THE LAUREL WREATH.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔD GIVE ANOTHER THREE ROUBLES FOR A COOK THIS MINUTE,‚ÄÙ ANOTHER VOICE ASSENTED LOUDLY, TOO LOUDLY; INSISTENTLY, IN FACT.

‚ÄÚSO WOULD I.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND I.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIS IT POSSIBLE THERE‚ÄÔS NO BUFFET?‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGENTLEMEN, IT‚ÄÔS SIMPLY A SWINDLE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

IT MUST BE ADMITTED, HOWEVER, THAT ALL THESE UNBRIDLED GENTLEMEN STILL STOOD IN AWE OF OUR HIGHER OFFICIALS AND OF THE POLICE SUPERINTENDENT, WHO WAS PRESENT IN THE HALL. TEN MINUTES LATER ALL HAD SOMEHOW GOT BACK INTO THEIR PLACES, BUT THERE WAS NOT THE SAME GOOD ORDER AS BEFORE. AND IT WAS INTO THIS INCIPIENT CHAOS THAT POOR STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS THRUST.

IV

I RAN OUT TO HIM BEHIND THE SCENES ONCE MORE, AND HAD TIME TO WARN HIM EXCITEDLY THAT IN MY OPINION THE GAME WAS UP, THAT HE HAD BETTER NOT APPEAR AT ALL, BUT HAD BETTER GO HOME AT ONCE ON THE EXCUSE OF HIS USUAL AILMENT, FOR INSTANCE, AND I WOULD TAKE OFF MY BADGE AND COME WITH HIM. AT THAT INSTANT HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE PLATFORM; HE STOPPED SUDDENLY, AND HAUGHTILY LOOKING ME UP AND DOWN HE PRONOUNCED SOLEMNLY:

‚ÄÚWHAT GROUNDS HAVE YOU, SIR, FOR THINKING ME CAPABLE OF SUCH BASENESS?‚ÄÙ

I DREW BACK. I WAS AS SURE AS TWICE TWO MAKE FOUR THAT HE WOULD NOT GET OFF WITHOUT A CATASTROPHE. MEANWHILE, AS I STOOD UTTERLY DEJECTED, I SAW MOVING BEFORE ME AGAIN THE FIGURE OF THE PROFESSOR, WHOSE TURN IT WAS TO APPEAR AFTER STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, AND WHO KEPT LIFTING UP HIS FIST AND BRINGING IT DOWN AGAIN WITH A SWING. HE KEPT WALKING UP AND DOWN, ABSORBED IN HIMSELF AND MUTTERING SOMETHING TO HIMSELF WITH A DIABOLICAL BUT TRIUMPHANT SMILE. I SOMEHOW ALMOST UNINTENTIONALLY WENT UP TO HIM. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT INDUCED ME TO MEDDLE AGAIN. ‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW,‚ÄÙ I SAID, ‚ÄÚJUDGING FROM MANY EXAMPLES, IF A LECTURER KEEPS AN AUDIENCE FOR MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES IT WON‚ÄÔT GO ON LISTENING. NO CELEBRITY IS ABLE TO HOLD HIS OWN FOR HALF AN HOUR.‚ÄÙ

HE STOPPED SHORT AND SEEMED ALMOST QUIVERING WITH RESENTMENT. INFINITE DISDAIN WAS EXPRESSED IN HIS COUNTENANCE.

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT TROUBLE YOURSELF,‚ÄÙ HE MUTTERED CONTEMPTUOUSLY AND WALKED ON. AT THAT MOMENT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS VOICE RANG OUT IN THE HALL.

‚ÄÚOH, HANG YOU ALL,‚ÄÙ I THOUGHT, AND RAN TO THE HALL.

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH TOOK HIS SEAT IN THE LECTURER‚ÄÔS CHAIR IN THE MIDST OF THE STILL PERSISTING DISORDER. HE WAS GREETED BY THE FIRST ROWS WITH LOOKS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY NOT OVER-FRIENDLY. (OF LATE, AT THE CLUB, PEOPLE ALMOST SEEMED NOT TO LIKE HIM, AND TREATED HIM WITH MUCH LESS RESPECT THAN FORMERLY.) BUT IT WAS SOMETHING TO THE GOOD THAT HE WAS NOT HISSED. I HAD HAD A STRANGE IDEA IN MY HEAD EVER SINCE THE PREVIOUS DAY: I KEPT FANCYING THAT HE WOULD BE RECEIVED WITH HISSES AS SOON AS HE APPEARED. THEY SCARCELY NOTICED HIM, HOWEVER, IN THE DISORDER. WHAT COULD THAT MAN HOPE FOR IF KARMAZINOV WAS TREATED LIKE THIS? HE WAS PALE; IT WAS TEN YEARS SINCE HE HAD APPEARED BEFORE AN AUDIENCE. FROM HIS EXCITEMENT AND FROM ALL THAT I KNEW SO WELL IN HIM, IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT HE, TOO, REGARDED HIS PRESENT APPEARANCE ON THE PLATFORM AS A TURNING-POINT OF HIS FATE, OR SOMETHING OF THE KIND. THAT WAS JUST WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF. THE MAN WAS DEAR TO ME. AND WHAT WERE MY FEELINGS WHEN HE OPENED HIS LIPS AND I HEARD HIS FIRST PHRASE?

‚ÄÚLADIES AND GENTLEMEN,‚ÄÙ HE PRONOUNCED SUDDENLY, AS THOUGH RESOLVED TO VENTURE EVERYTHING, THOUGH IN AN ALMOST BREAKING VOICE. ‚ÄÚLADIES AND GENTLEMEN! ONLY THIS MORNING THERE LAY BEFORE ME ONE OF THE ILLEGAL LEAFLETS THAT HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED HERE LATELY, AND I ASKED MYSELF FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME, ‚ÄÒWHEREIN LIES ITS SECRET?‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

THE WHOLE HALL BECAME INSTANTLY STILL, ALL LOOKS WERE TURNED TO HIM, SOME WITH POSITIVE ALARM. THERE WAS NO DENYING, HE KNEW HOW TO SECURE THEIR INTEREST FROM THE FIRST WORD. HEADS WERE THRUST OUT FROM BEHIND THE SCENES; LIPUTIN AND LYAMSHIN LISTENED GREEDILY. YULIA MIHAILOVNA WAVED TO ME AGAIN.

‚ÄÚSTOP HIM, WHATEVER HAPPENS, STOP HIM,‚ÄÙ SHE WHISPERED IN AGITATION. I COULD ONLY SHRUG MY SHOULDERS: HOW COULD ONE STOP A MAN RESOLVED TO VENTURE EVERYTHING? ALAS, I UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS IN STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS MIND.

‚ÄÚHA HA, THE MANIFESTOES!‚ÄÙ WAS WHISPERED IN THE AUDIENCE; THE WHOLE HALL WAS STIRRED.

‚ÄÚLADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I‚ÄÔVE SOLVED THE WHOLE MYSTERY. THE WHOLE SECRET OF THEIR EFFECT LIES IN THEIR STUPIDITY.‚ÄÙ (HIS EYES FLASHED.) ‚ÄÚYES, GENTLEMEN, IF THIS STUPIDITY WERE INTENTIONAL, PRETENDED AND CALCULATED, OH, THAT WOULD BE A STROKE OF GENIUS! BUT WE MUST DO THEM JUSTICE: THEY DON‚ÄÔT PRETEND ANYTHING. IT‚ÄÔS THE BAREST, MOST SIMPLE-HEARTED, MOST SHALLOW STUPIDITY. C‚ÄÔEST LA B√™TISE DANS SON ESSENCE LA PLUS PURE, QUELQUE CHOSE COMME UN SIMPLE CHIMIQUE. IF IT WERE EXPRESSED EVER SO LITTLE MORE CLEVERLY, EVERY ONE WOULD SEE AT ONCE THE POVERTY OF THIS SHALLOW STUPIDITY. BUT AS IT IS, EVERY ONE IS LEFT WONDERING: NO ONE CAN BELIEVE THAT IT IS SUCH ELEMENTARY STUPIDITY. ‚ÄÒIT‚ÄÔS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE‚ÄÔS NOTHING MORE IN IT,‚ÄÔ EVERY ONE SAYS TO HIMSELF AND TRIES TO FIND THE SECRET OF IT, SEES A MYSTERY IN IT, TRIES TO READ BETWEEN THE LINES‚ÄÎTHE EFFECT IS ATTAINED! OH, NEVER HAS STUPIDITY BEEN SO SOLEMNLY REWARDED, THOUGH IT HAS SO OFTEN DESERVED IT.‚Ä¶ FOR, EN PARENTHESE, STUPIDITY IS OF AS MUCH SERVICE TO HUMANITY AS THE LOFTIEST GENIUS.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEPIGRAM OF 1840‚ÄÙ WAS COMMENTED, IN A VERY MODEST VOICE, HOWEVER, BUT IT WAS FOLLOWED BY A GENERAL OUTBREAK OF NOISE AND UPROAR.

‚ÄÚLADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HURRAH! I PROPOSE A TOAST TO STUPIDITY!‚ÄÙ CRIED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, DEFYING THE AUDIENCE IN A PERFECT FRENZY.

I RAN UP ON THE PRETEXT OF POURING OUT SOME WATER FOR HIM.

‚ÄÚSTEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, LEAVE OFF, YULIA MIHAILOVNA ENTREATS YOU TO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, YOU LEAVE ME ALONE, IDLE YOUNG MAN,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED OUT AT ME AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE. I RAN AWAY. ‚ÄÚMESSIEURS,‚ÄÙ HE WENT ON, ‚ÄÚWHY THIS EXCITEMENT, WHY THE OUTCRIES OF INDIGNATION I HEAR? I HAVE COME FORWARD WITH AN OLIVE BRANCH. I BRING YOU THE LAST WORD, FOR IN THIS BUSINESS I HAVE THE LAST WORD‚ÄÎAND WE SHALL BE RECONCILED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDOWN WITH HIM!‚ÄÙ SHOUTED SOME.

‚ÄÚHUSH, LET HIM SPEAK, LET HIM HAVE HIS SAY!‚ÄÙ YELLED ANOTHER SECTION. THE YOUNG TEACHER WAS PARTICULARLY EXCITED; HAVING ONCE BROUGHT HIMSELF TO SPEAK HE SEEMED NOW UNABLE TO BE SILENT.

‚ÄÚMESSIEURS, THE LAST WORD IN THIS BUSINESS‚ÄÎIS FORGIVENESS. I, AN OLD MAN AT THE END OF MY LIFE, I SOLEMNLY DECLARE THAT THE SPIRIT OF LIFE BREATHES IN US STILL, AND THERE IS STILL A LIVING STRENGTH IN THE YOUNG GENERATION. THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE YOUTH OF TODAY IS AS PURE AND BRIGHT AS IN OUR AGE. ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED IS A CHANGE OF AIM, THE REPLACING OF ONE BEAUTY BY ANOTHER! THE WHOLE DIFFICULTY LIES IN THE QUESTION WHICH IS MORE BEAUTIFUL, SHAKESPEARE OR BOOTS, RAPHAEL OR PETROLEUM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS TREACHERY!‚ÄÙ GROWLED SOME.

‚ÄÚCOMPROMISING QUESTIONS!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAGENT PROVOCATEUR!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT I MAINTAIN,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SHRILLED AT THE UTMOST PITCH OF EXCITEMENT, ‚ÄÚI MAINTAIN THAT SHAKESPEARE AND RAPHAEL ARE MORE PRECIOUS THAN THE EMANCIPATION OF THE SERFS, MORE PRECIOUS THAN NATIONALISM, MORE PRECIOUS THAN SOCIALISM, MORE PRECIOUS THAN THE YOUNG GENERATION, MORE PRECIOUS THAN CHEMISTRY, MORE PRECIOUS THAN ALMOST ALL HUMANITY BECAUSE THEY ARE THE FRUIT, THE REAL FRUIT OF ALL HUMANITY AND PERHAPS THE HIGHEST FRUIT THAT CAN BE. A FORM OF BEAUTY ALREADY ATTAINED, BUT FOR THE ATTAINING OF WHICH I WOULD NOT PERHAPS CONSENT TO LIVE.‚Ä¶ OH, HEAVENS!‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, CLASPING HIS HANDS, ‚ÄÚTEN YEARS AGO I SAID THE SAME THING FROM THE PLATFORM IN PETERSBURG, EXACTLY THE SAME THING, IN THE SAME WORDS, AND IN JUST THE SAME WAY THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT, THEY LAUGHED AND HISSED AS NOW; SHALLOW PEOPLE, WHAT IS LACKING IN YOU THAT YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND? BUT LET ME TELL YOU, LET ME TELL YOU, WITHOUT THE ENGLISH, LIFE IS STILL POSSIBLE FOR HUMANITY, WITHOUT GERMANY, LIFE IS POSSIBLE, WITHOUT THE RUSSIANS IT IS ONLY TOO POSSIBLE, WITHOUT SCIENCE, WITHOUT BREAD, LIFE IS POSSIBLE‚ÄÎONLY WITHOUT BEAUTY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE, FOR THERE WILL BE NOTHING LEFT IN THE WORLD. THAT‚ÄÔS THE SECRET AT THE BOTTOM OF EVERYTHING, THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT HISTORY TEACHES! EVEN SCIENCE WOULD NOT EXIST A MOMENT WITHOUT BEAUTY‚ÄÎDO YOU KNOW THAT, YOU WHO LAUGH‚ÄÎIT WILL SINK INTO BONDAGE, YOU WON‚ÄÔT INVENT A NAIL EVEN!‚Ä¶ I WON‚ÄÔT YIELD AN INCH!‚ÄÙ HE SHOUTED ABSURDLY IN CONFUSION, AND WITH ALL HIS MIGHT BANGED HIS FIST ON THE TABLE.

BUT ALL THE WHILE THAT HE WAS SHRIEKING SENSELESSLY AND INCOHERENTLY, THE DISORDER IN THE HALL INCREASED. MANY PEOPLE JUMPED UP FROM THEIR SEATS, SOME DASHED FORWARD, NEARER TO THE PLATFORM. IT ALL HAPPENED MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN I DESCRIBE IT, AND THERE WAS NO TIME TO TAKE STEPS, PERHAPS NO WISH TO, EITHER.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS ALL RIGHT FOR YOU, WITH EVERYTHING FOUND FOR YOU, YOU PAMPERED CREATURES!‚ÄÙ THE SAME DIVINITY STUDENT BELLOWED AT THE FOOT OF THE PLATFORM, GRINNING WITH RELISH AT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, WHO NOTICED IT AND DARTED TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE PLATFORM.

‚ÄÚHAVEN‚ÄÔT I, HAVEN‚ÄÔT I JUST DECLARED THAT THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE YOUNG GENERATION IS AS PURE AND BRIGHT AS IT WAS, AND THAT IT IS COMING TO GRIEF THROUGH BEING DECEIVED ONLY IN THE FORMS OF BEAUTY! ISN‚ÄÔT THAT ENOUGH FOR YOU? AND IF YOU CONSIDER THAT HE WHO PROCLAIMS THIS IS A FATHER CRUSHED AND INSULTED, CAN ONE‚ÄÎOH, SHALLOW HEARTS‚ÄÎCAN ONE RISE TO GREATER HEIGHTS OF IMPARTIALITY AND FAIRNESS?‚Ä¶ UNGRATEFUL ‚Ä¶ UNJUST.‚Ä¶ WHY, WHY CAN‚ÄÔT YOU BE RECONCILED!‚ÄÙ

AND HE BURST INTO HYSTERICAL SOBS. HE WIPED AWAY HIS DROPPING TEARS WITH HIS FINGERS. HIS SHOULDERS AND BREAST WERE HEAVING WITH SOBS. HE WAS LOST TO EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD.

A PERFECT PANIC CAME OVER THE AUDIENCE, ALMOST ALL GOT UP FROM THEIR SEATS. YULIA MIHAILOVNA, TOO, JUMPED UP QUICKLY, SEIZING HER HUSBAND BY THE ARM AND PULLING HIM UP TOO.‚Ä¶ THE SCENE WAS BEYOND ALL BELIEF.

‚ÄÚSTEPAN TROFIMOVITCH!‚ÄÙ THE DIVINITY STUDENT ROARED GLEEFULLY. ‚ÄÚTHERE‚ÄÔS FEDKA THE CONVICT WANDERING ABOUT THE TOWN AND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, ESCAPED FROM PRISON. HE IS A ROBBER AND HAS RECENTLY COMMITTED ANOTHER MURDER. ALLOW ME TO ASK YOU: IF YOU HAD NOT SOLD HIM AS A RECRUIT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO TO PAY A GAMBLING DEBT, THAT IS, MORE SIMPLY, LOST HIM AT CARDS, TELL ME, WOULD HE HAVE GOT INTO PRISON? WOULD HE HAVE CUT MEN‚ÄÔS THROATS NOW, IN HIS STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE? WHAT DO YOU SAY, MR. √ÜSTHETE?‚ÄÙ

I DECLINE TO DESCRIBE THE SCENE THAT FOLLOWED. TO BEGIN WITH THERE WAS A FURIOUS VOLLEY OF APPLAUSE. THE APPLAUSE DID NOT COME FROM ALL‚ÄÎPROBABLY FROM SOME FIFTH PART OF THE AUDIENCE‚ÄÎBUT THEY APPLAUDED FURIOUSLY. THE REST OF THE PUBLIC MADE FOR THE EXIT, BUT AS THE APPLAUDING PART OF THE AUDIENCE KEPT PRESSING FORWARD TOWARDS THE PLATFORM, THERE WAS A REGULAR BLOCK. THE LADIES SCREAMED, SOME OF THE GIRLS BEGAN TO CRY AND ASKED TO GO HOME. LEMBKE, STANDING UP BY HIS CHAIR, KEPT GAZING WILDLY ABOUT HIM. YULIA MIHAILOVNA COMPLETELY LOST HER HEAD‚ÄÎFOR THE FIRST TIME DURING HER CAREER AMONGST US. AS FOR STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, FOR THE FIRST MOMENT HE SEEMED LITERALLY CRUSHED BY THE DIVINITY STUDENT‚ÄÔS WORDS, BUT HE SUDDENLY RAISED HIS ARMS AS THOUGH HOLDING THEM OUT ABOVE THE PUBLIC AND YELLED:

‚ÄÚI SHAKE THE DUST FROM OFF MY FEET AND I CURSE YOU.‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS THE END, THE END.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

AND TURNING, HE RAN BEHIND THE SCENES, WAVING HIS HANDS MENACINGLY.

‚ÄÚHE HAS INSULTED THE AUDIENCE!‚Ä¶ VERHOVENSKY!‚ÄÙ THE ANGRY SECTION ROARED. THEY EVEN WANTED TO RUSH IN PURSUIT OF HIM. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO APPEASE THEM, AT THE MOMENT, ANY WAY, AND‚ÄÎA FINAL CATASTROPHE BROKE LIKE A BOMB ON THE ASSEMBLY AND EXPLODED IN ITS MIDST: THE THIRD READER, THE MANIAC WHO KEPT WAVING HIS FIST BEHIND THE SCENES, SUDDENLY RAN ON TO THE PLATFORM. HE LOOKED LIKE A PERFECT MADMAN. WITH A BROAD, TRIUMPHANT SMILE, FULL OF BOUNDLESS SELF-CONFIDENCE, HE LOOKED ROUND AT THE AGITATED HALL AND HE SEEMED TO BE DELIGHTED AT THE DISORDER. HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST DISCONCERTED AT HAVING TO SPEAK IN SUCH AN UPROAR, ON THE CONTRARY, HE WAS OBVIOUSLY DELIGHTED. THIS WAS SO OBVIOUS THAT IT ATTRACTED ATTENTION AT ONCE.

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THIS NOW?‚ÄÙ PEOPLE WERE HEARD ASKING. ‚ÄÚWHO IS THIS? SH-H! WHAT DOES HE WANT TO SAY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLADIES AND GENTLEMEN,‚ÄÙ THE MANIAC SHOUTED WITH ALL HIS MIGHT, STANDING AT THE VERY EDGE OF THE PLATFORM AND SPEAKING WITH ALMOST AS SHRILL, FEMININE A VOICE AS KARMAZINOV‚ÄÔS, BUT WITHOUT THE ARISTOCRATIC LISP. ‚ÄÚLADIES AND GENTLEMEN! TWENTY YEARS AGO, ON THE EVE OF WAR WITH HALF EUROPE, RUSSIA WAS REGARDED AS AN IDEAL COUNTRY BY OFFICIALS OF ALL RANKS! LITERATURE WAS IN THE SERVICE OF THE CENSORSHIP; MILITARY DRILL WAS ALL THAT WAS TAUGHT AT THE UNIVERSITIES; THE TROOPS WERE TRAINED LIKE A BALLET, AND THE PEASANTS PAID THE TAXES AND WERE MUTE UNDER THE LASH OF SERFDOM. PATRIOTISM MEANT THE WRINGING OF BRIBES FROM THE QUICK AND THE DEAD. THOSE WHO DID NOT TAKE BRIBES WERE LOOKED UPON AS REBELS BECAUSE THEY DISTURBED THE GENERAL HARMONY. THE BIRCH COPSES WERE EXTIRPATED IN SUPPORT OF DISCIPLINE. EUROPE TREMBLED.‚Ä¶ BUT NEVER IN THE THOUSAND YEARS OF ITS SENSELESS EXISTENCE HAD RUSSIA SUNK TO SUCH IGNOMINY.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

HE RAISED HIS FIST, WAVED IT ECSTATICALLY AND MENACINGLY OVER HIS HEAD AND SUDDENLY BROUGHT IT DOWN FURIOUSLY, AS THOUGH POUNDING AN ADVERSARY TO POWDER. A FRANTIC YELL ROSE FROM THE WHOLE HALL, THERE WAS A DEAFENING ROAR OF APPLAUSE; ALMOST HALF THE AUDIENCE WAS APPLAUDING: THEIR ENTHUSIASM WAS EXCUSABLE. RUSSIA WAS BEING PUT TO SHAME PUBLICLY, BEFORE EVERY ONE. WHO COULD FAIL TO ROAR WITH DELIGHT?

‚ÄÚTHIS IS THE REAL THING! COME, THIS IS SOMETHING LIKE! HURRAH! YES, THIS IS NONE OF YOUR √¶STHETICS!‚ÄÙ

THE MANIAC WENT ON ECSTATICALLY:

‚ÄÚTWENTY YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN. UNIVERSITIES HAVE BEEN OPENED AND MULTIPLIED. MILITARY DRILL HAS PASSED INTO A LEGEND; OFFICERS ARE TOO FEW BY THOUSANDS, THE RAILWAYS HAVE EATEN UP ALL THE CAPITAL AND HAVE COVERED RUSSIA AS WITH A SPIDER‚ÄÔS WEB, SO THAT IN ANOTHER FIFTEEN YEARS ONE WILL PERHAPS GET SOMEWHERE. BRIDGES ARE RARELY ON FIRE, AND FIRES IN TOWNS OCCUR ONLY AT REGULAR INTERVALS, IN TURN, AT THE PROPER SEASON. IN THE LAW COURTS JUDGMENTS ARE AS WISE AS SOLOMON‚ÄÔS, AND THE JURY ONLY TAKE BRIBES THROUGH THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE, TO ESCAPE STARVATION. THE SERFS ARE FREE, AND FLOG ONE ANOTHER INSTEAD OF BEING FLOGGED BY THE LAND-OWNERS. SEAS AND OCEANS OF VODKA ARE CONSUMED TO SUPPORT THE BUDGET, AND IN NOVGOROD, OPPOSITE THE ANCIENT AND USELESS ST. SOPHIA, THERE HAS BEEN SOLEMNLY PUT UP A COLOSSAL BRONZE GLOBE TO CELEBRATE A THOUSAND YEARS OF DISORDER AND CONFUSION; EUROPE SCOWLS AND BEGINS TO BE UNEASY AGAIN.‚Ä¶ FIFTEEN YEARS OF REFORMS! AND YET NEVER EVEN IN THE MOST GROTESQUE PERIODS OF ITS MADNESS HAS RUSSIA SUNK ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

THE LAST WORDS COULD NOT BE HEARD IN THE ROAR OF THE CROWD. ONE COULD SEE HIM AGAIN RAISE HIS ARM AND BRING IT DOWN TRIUMPHANTLY AGAIN. ENTHUSIASM WAS BEYOND ALL BOUNDS: PEOPLE YELLED, CLAPPED THEIR HANDS, EVEN SOME OF THE LADIES SHOUTED: ‚ÄÚENOUGH, YOU CAN‚ÄÔT BEAT THAT!‚ÄÙ SOME MIGHT HAVE BEEN DRUNK. THE ORATOR SCANNED THEM ALL AND SEEMED REVELLING IN HIS OWN TRIUMPH. I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF LEMBKE IN INDESCRIBABLE EXCITEMENT, POINTING SOMETHING OUT TO SOMEBODY. YULIA MIHAILOVNA, WITH A PALE FACE, SAID SOMETHING IN HASTE TO THE PRINCE, WHO HAD RUN UP TO HER. BUT AT THAT MOMENT A GROUP OF SIX MEN, OFFICIALS MORE OR LESS, BURST ON TO THE PLATFORM, SEIZED THE ORATOR AND DRAGGED HIM BEHIND THE SCENES. I CAN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND HOW HE MANAGED TO TEAR HIMSELF AWAY FROM THEM, BUT HE DID ESCAPE, DARTED UP TO THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM AGAIN AND SUCCEEDED IN SHOUTING AGAIN, AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE, WAVING HIS FIST: ‚ÄÚBUT NEVER HAS RUSSIA SUNK ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

BUT HE WAS DRAGGED AWAY AGAIN. I SAW SOME FIFTEEN MEN DASH BEHIND THE SCENES TO RESCUE HIM, NOT CROSSING THE PLATFORM BUT BREAKING DOWN THE LIGHT SCREEN AT THE SIDE OF IT.‚Ä¶ I SAW AFTERWARDS, THOUGH I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY EYES, THE GIRL STUDENT (VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS SISTER) LEAP ON TO THE PLATFORM WITH THE SAME ROLL UNDER HER ARM, DRESSED AS BEFORE, AS PLUMP AND ROSY AS EVER, SURROUNDED BY TWO OR THREE WOMEN AND TWO OR THREE MEN, AND ACCOMPANIED BY HER MORTAL ENEMY, THE SCHOOLBOY. I EVEN CAUGHT THE PHRASE:

‚ÄÚLADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I‚ÄÔVE COME TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE SUFFERINGS OF POOR STUDENTS AND TO ROUSE THEM TO A GENERAL PROTEST ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

BUT I RAN AWAY. HIDING MY BADGE IN MY POCKET I MADE MY WAY FROM THE HOUSE INTO THE STREET BY BACK PASSAGES WHICH I KNEW OF. FIRST OF ALL, OF COURSE, I WENT TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS.





CHAPTER II. THE END OF THE FETE

I

HE WOULD NOT SEE ME. HE HAD SHUT HIMSELF UP AND WAS WRITING. AT MY REPEATED KNOCKS AND APPEALS HE ANSWERED THROUGH THE DOOR:

‚ÄÚMY FRIEND, I HAVE FINISHED EVERYTHING. WHO CAN ASK ANYTHING MORE OF ME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU HAVEN‚ÄÔT FINISHED ANYTHING, YOU‚ÄÔVE ONLY HELPED TO MAKE A MESS OF THE WHOLE THING. FOR GOD‚ÄÔS SAKE, NO EPIGRAMS, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH! OPEN THE DOOR. WE MUST TAKE STEPS; THEY MAY STILL COME AND INSULT YOU.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

I THOUGHT MYSELF ENTITLED TO BE PARTICULARLY SEVERE AND EVEN RIGOROUS. I WAS AFRAID HE MIGHT BE GOING TO DO SOMETHING STILL MORE MAD. BUT TO MY SURPRISE I MET AN EXTRAORDINARY FIRMNESS.

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT BE THE FIRST TO INSULT ME THEN. I THANK YOU FOR THE PAST, BUT I REPEAT I‚ÄÔVE DONE WITH ALL MEN, GOOD AND BAD. I AM WRITING TO DARYA PAVLOVNA, WHOM I‚ÄÔVE FORGOTTEN SO UNPARDONABLY TILL NOW. YOU MAY TAKE IT TO HER TO-MORROW, IF YOU LIKE, NOW MERCI.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSTEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MATTER IS MORE SERIOUS THAN YOU THINK. DO YOU THINK THAT YOU‚ÄÔVE CRUSHED SOMEONE THERE? YOU‚ÄÔVE PULVERISED NO ONE, BUT HAVE BROKEN YOURSELF TO PIECES LIKE AN EMPTY BOTTLE.‚ÄÙ (OH, I WAS COARSE AND DISCOURTEOUS, I REMEMBER IT WITH REGRET.) ‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO WRITE TO DARYA PAVLOVNA ‚Ä¶ AND WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH YOURSELF WITHOUT ME? WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND ABOUT PRACTICAL LIFE? I EXPECT YOU ARE PLOTTING SOMETHING ELSE? YOU‚ÄÔLL SIMPLY COME TO GRIEF AGAIN IF YOU GO PLOTTING SOMETHING MORE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

HE ROSE AND CAME CLOSE UP TO THE DOOR.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE NOT BEEN LONG WITH THEM, BUT YOU‚ÄÔVE CAUGHT THE INFECTION OF THEIR TONE AND LANGUAGE. DIEU VOUS PARDONNE, MON AMI, ET DIEU VOUS GARDE. BUT I‚ÄÔVE ALWAYS SEEN IN YOU THE GERMS OF DELICATE FEELING, AND YOU WILL GET OVER IT PERHAPS‚ÄÎAPR√®S LE TEMPS, OF COURSE, LIKE ALL OF US RUSSIANS. AS FOR WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT MY IMPRACTICABILITY, I‚ÄÔLL REMIND YOU OF A RECENT IDEA OF MINE: A WHOLE MASS OF PEOPLE IN RUSSIA DO NOTHING WHATEVER BUT ATTACK OTHER PEOPLE‚ÄÔS IMPRACTICABILITY WITH THE UTMOST FURY AND WITH THE TIRESOME PERSISTENCE OF FLIES IN THE SUMMER, ACCUSING EVERY ONE OF IT EXCEPT THEMSELVES. CHER, REMEMBER THAT I AM EXCITED, AND DON‚ÄÔT DISTRESS ME. ONCE MORE MERCI FOR EVERYTHING, AND LET US PART LIKE KARMAZINOV AND THE PUBLIC; THAT IS, LET US FORGET EACH OTHER WITH AS MUCH GENEROSITY AS WE CAN. HE WAS POSING IN BEGGING HIS FORMER READERS SO EARNESTLY TO FORGET HIM; QUANT √† MOI, I AM NOT SO CONCEITED, AND I REST MY HOPES ON THE YOUTH OF YOUR INEXPERIENCED HEART. HOW SHOULD YOU REMEMBER A USELESS OLD MAN FOR LONG? ‚ÄÒLIVE MORE,‚ÄÔ MY FRIEND, AS NASTASYA WISHED ME ON MY LAST NAME-DAY (CES PAUVRES GENS ONT QUELQUEFOIS DES MOTS CHARMANTS ET PLEINS DE PHILOSOPHIE). I DO NOT WISH YOU MUCH HAPPINESS‚ÄÎIT WILL BORE YOU. I DO NOT WISH YOU TROUBLE EITHER, BUT, FOLLOWING THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE PEASANT, I WILL REPEAT SIMPLY ‚ÄÒLIVE MORE‚ÄÔ AND TRY NOT TO BE MUCH BORED; THIS USELESS WISH I ADD FROM MYSELF. WELL, GOOD-BYE, AND GOOD-BYE FOR GOOD. DON‚ÄÔT STAND AT MY DOOR, I WILL NOT OPEN IT.‚ÄÙ

HE WENT AWAY AND I COULD GET NOTHING MORE OUT OF HIM. IN SPITE OF HIS ‚ÄÚEXCITEMENT,‚ÄÙ HE SPOKE SMOOTHLY, DELIBERATELY, WITH WEIGHT, OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO BE IMPRESSIVE. OF COURSE HE WAS RATHER VEXED WITH ME AND WAS AVENGING HIMSELF INDIRECTLY, POSSIBLY EVEN FOR THE YESTERDAY‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚPRISON CARTS‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚFLOORS THAT GIVE WAY.‚ÄÙ HIS TEARS IN PUBLIC THAT MORNING, IN SPITE OF A TRIUMPH OF A SORT, HAD PUT HIM, HE KNEW, IN RATHER A COMIC POSITION, AND THERE NEVER WAS A MAN MORE SOLICITOUS OF DIGNITY AND PUNCTILIO IN HIS RELATIONS WITH HIS FRIENDS THAN STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. OH, I DON‚ÄÔT BLAME HIM. BUT THIS FASTIDIOUSNESS AND IRONY WHICH HE PRESERVED IN SPITE OF ALL SHOCKS REASSURED ME AT THE TIME. A MAN WHO WAS SO LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM HIS ORDINARY SELF WAS, OF COURSE, NOT IN THE MOOD AT THAT MOMENT FOR ANYTHING TRAGIC OR EXTRAORDINARY. SO I REASONED AT THE TIME, AND, HEAVENS, WHAT A MISTAKE I MADE! I LEFT TOO MUCH OUT OF MY RECKONING.

IN ANTICIPATION OF EVENTS I WILL QUOTE THE FEW FIRST LINES OF THE LETTER TO DARYA PAVLOVNA, WHICH SHE ACTUALLY RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING DAY:

‚ÄÚMON ENFANT, MY HAND TREMBLES, BUT I‚ÄÔVE DONE WITH EVERYTHING. YOU WERE NOT PRESENT AT MY LAST STRUGGLE: YOU DID NOT COME TO THAT MATIN√©E, AND YOU DID WELL TO STAY AWAY. BUT YOU WILL BE TOLD THAT IN OUR RUSSIA, WHICH HAS GROWN SO POOR IN MEN OF CHARACTER, ONE MAN HAD THE COURAGE TO STAND UP AND, IN SPITE OF DEADLY MENACES SHOWERED ON HIM FROM ALL SIDES, TO TELL THE FOOLS THE TRUTH, THAT IS, THAT THEY ARE FOOLS. OH, CE SONT‚ÄÎDES PAUVRES PETITS VAURIENS ET RIEN DE PLUS, DES PETITS‚ÄÎFOOLS‚ÄÎVOIL√† LE MOT! THE DIE IS CAST; I AM GOING FROM THIS TOWN FOREVER AND I KNOW NOT WHITHER. EVERY ONE I LOVED HAS TURNED FROM ME. BUT YOU, YOU ARE A PURE AND NA√ØVE CREATURE; YOU, A GENTLE BEING WHOSE LIFE HAS BEEN ALL BUT LINKED WITH MINE AT THE WILL OF A CAPRICIOUS AND IMPERIOUS HEART; YOU WHO LOOKED AT ME PERHAPS WITH CONTEMPT WHEN I SHED WEAK TEARS ON THE EVE OF OUR FRUSTRATED MARRIAGE; YOU, WHO CANNOT IN ANY CASE LOOK ON ME EXCEPT AS A COMIC FIGURE‚ÄÎFOR YOU, FOR YOU IS THE LAST CRY OF MY HEART, FOR YOU MY LAST DUTY, FOR YOU ALONE! I CANNOT LEAVE YOU FOREVER THINKING OF ME AS AN UNGRATEFUL FOOL, A CHURLISH EGOIST, AS PROBABLY A CRUEL AND UNGRATEFUL HEART‚ÄÎWHOM, ALAS, I CANNOT FORGET‚ÄÎIS EVERY DAY DESCRIBING ME TO YOU.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

AND SO ON AND SO ON, FOUR LARGE PAGES.

ANSWERING HIS ‚ÄÚI WON‚ÄÔT OPEN‚ÄÙ WITH THREE BANGS WITH MY FIST ON THE DOOR, AND SHOUTING AFTER HIM THAT I WAS SURE HE WOULD SEND NASTASYA FOR ME THREE TIMES THAT DAY, BUT I WOULD NOT COME, I GAVE HIM UP AND RAN OFF TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA.

II

THERE I WAS THE WITNESS OF A REVOLTING SCENE: THE POOR WOMAN WAS DECEIVED TO HER FACE, AND I COULD DO NOTHING. INDEED, WHAT COULD I SAY TO HER? I HAD HAD TIME TO RECONSIDER THINGS A LITTLE AND REFLECT THAT I HAD NOTHING TO GO UPON BUT CERTAIN FEELINGS AND SUSPICIOUS PRESENTIMENTS. I FOUND HER IN TEARS, ALMOST IN HYSTERICS, WITH COMPRESSES OF EAU-DE-COLOGNE AND A GLASS OF WATER. BEFORE HER STOOD PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WHO TALKED WITHOUT STOPPING, AND THE PRINCE, WHO HELD HIS TONGUE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN UNDER A LOCK. WITH TEARS AND LAMENTATIONS SHE REPROACHED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH FOR HIS ‚ÄÚDESERTION.‚ÄÙ I WAS STRUCK AT ONCE BY THE FACT THAT SHE ASCRIBED THE WHOLE FAILURE, THE WHOLE IGNOMINY OF THE MATIN√©E, EVERYTHING IN FACT, TO PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS ABSENCE.

IN HIM I OBSERVED AN IMPORTANT CHANGE: HE SEEMED A SHADE TOO ANXIOUS, ALMOST SERIOUS. AS A RULE HE NEVER SEEMED SERIOUS; HE WAS ALWAYS LAUGHING, EVEN WHEN HE WAS ANGRY, AND HE WAS OFTEN ANGRY. OH, HE WAS ANGRY NOW! HE WAS SPEAKING COARSELY, CARELESSLY, WITH VEXATION AND IMPATIENCE. HE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN TAKEN ILL AT GAGANOV‚ÄÔS LODGING, WHERE HE HAD HAPPENED TO GO EARLY IN THE MORNING. ALAS, THE POOR WOMAN WAS SO ANXIOUS TO BE DECEIVED AGAIN! THE CHIEF QUESTION WHICH I FOUND BEING DISCUSSED WAS WHETHER THE BALL, THAT IS, THE WHOLE SECOND HALF OF THE F√™TE, SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT TAKE PLACE. YULIA MIHAILOVNA COULD NOT BE INDUCED TO APPEAR AT THE BALL ‚ÄÚAFTER THE INSULTS SHE HAD RECEIVED THAT MORNING‚ÄÙ; IN OTHER WORDS, HER HEART WAS SET ON BEING COMPELLED TO DO SO, AND BY HIM, BY PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. SHE LOOKED UPON HIM AS AN ORACLE, AND I BELIEVE IF HE HAD GONE AWAY SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN TO HER BED AT ONCE. BUT HE DID NOT WANT TO GO AWAY; HE WAS DESPERATELY ANXIOUS THAT THE BALL SHOULD TAKE PLACE AND THAT YULIA MIHAILOVNA SHOULD BE PRESENT AT IT.

‚ÄÚCOME, WHAT IS THERE TO CRY ABOUT? ARE YOU SET ON HAVING A SCENE? ON VENTING YOUR ANGER ON SOMEBODY? WELL, VENT IT ON ME; ONLY MAKE HASTE ABOUT IT, FOR THE TIME IS PASSING AND YOU MUST MAKE UP YOUR MIND. WE MADE A MESS OF IT WITH THE MATIN√©E; WE‚ÄÔLL PICK UP ON THE BALL. HERE, THE PRINCE THINKS AS I DO. YES, IF IT HADN‚ÄÔT BEEN FOR THE PRINCE, HOW WOULD THINGS HAVE ENDED THERE?‚ÄÙ

THE PRINCE HAD BEEN AT FIRST OPPOSED TO THE BALL (THAT IS, OPPOSED TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS APPEARING AT IT; THE BALL WAS BOUND TO GO ON IN ANY CASE), BUT AFTER TWO OR THREE SUCH REFERENCES TO HIS OPINION HE BEGAN LITTLE BY LITTLE TO GRUNT HIS ACQUIESCENCE.

I WAS SURPRISED TOO AT THE EXTRAORDINARY RUDENESS OF PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS TONE. OH, I SCOUT WITH INDIGNATION THE CONTEMPTIBLE SLANDER WHICH WAS SPREAD LATER OF SOME SUPPOSED LIAISON BETWEEN YULIA MIHAILOVNA AND PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. THERE WAS NO SUCH THING, NOR COULD THERE BE. HE GAINED HIS ASCENDENCY OVER HER FROM THE FIRST ONLY BY ENCOURAGING HER IN HER DREAMS OF INFLUENCE IN SOCIETY AND IN THE MINISTRY, BY ENTERING INTO HER PLANS, BY INVENTING THEM FOR HER, AND WORKING UPON HER WITH THE GROSSEST FLATTERY. HE HAD GOT HER COMPLETELY INTO HIS TOILS AND HAD BECOME AS NECESSARY TO HER AS THE AIR SHE BREATHED. SEEING ME, SHE CRIED, WITH FLASHING EYES:

‚ÄÚHERE, ASK HIM. HE KEPT BY MY SIDE ALL THE WHILE, JUST LIKE THE PRINCE DID. TELL ME, ISN‚ÄÔT IT PLAIN THAT IT WAS ALL A PRECONCERTED PLOT, A BASE, DESIGNING PLOT TO DAMAGE ANDREY ANTONOVITCH AND ME AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE? OH, THEY HAD ARRANGED IT BEFOREHAND. THEY HAD A PLAN! IT‚ÄÔS A PARTY, A REGULAR PARTY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE EXAGGERATING AS USUAL. YOU‚ÄÔVE ALWAYS SOME ROMANTIC NOTION IN YOUR HEAD. BUT I AM GLAD TO SEE MR.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ (HE PRETENDED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN MY NAME.) ‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔLL GIVE US HIS OPINION.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMY OPINION,‚ÄÙ I HASTENED TO PUT IN, ‚ÄÚIS THE SAME AS YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS. THE PLOT IS ONLY TOO EVIDENT. I HAVE BROUGHT YOU THESE RIBBONS, YULIA MIHAILOVNA. WHETHER THE BALL IS TO TAKE PLACE OR NOT IS NOT MY BUSINESS, FOR IT‚ÄÔS NOT IN MY POWER TO DECIDE; BUT MY PART AS STEWARD IS OVER. FORGIVE MY WARMTH, BUT I CAN‚ÄÔT ACT AGAINST THE DICTATES OF COMMON SENSE AND MY OWN CONVICTIONS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU HEAR! YOU HEAR!‚ÄÙ SHE CLASPED HER HANDS.

‚ÄÚI HEAR, AND I TELL YOU THIS.‚ÄÙ HE TURNED TO ME. ‚ÄÚI THINK YOU MUST HAVE EATEN SOMETHING WHICH HAS MADE YOU ALL DELIRIOUS. TO MY THINKING, NOTHING HAS HAPPENED, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE AND IS ALWAYS LIABLE TO HAPPEN IN THIS TOWN. A PLOT, INDEED! IT WAS AN UGLY FAILURE, DISGRACEFULLY STUPID. BUT WHERE‚ÄÔS THE PLOT? A PLOT AGAINST YULIA MIHAILOVNA, WHO HAS SPOILED THEM AND PROTECTED THEM AND FONDLY FORGIVEN THEM ALL THEIR SCHOOLBOY PRANKS! YULIA MIHAILOVNA! WHAT HAVE I BEEN HAMMERING INTO YOU FOR THE LAST MONTH CONTINUALLY? WHAT DID I WARN YOU? WHAT DID YOU WANT WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE‚ÄÎWHAT DID YOU WANT WITH THEM? WHAT INDUCED YOU TO MIX YOURSELF UP WITH THESE FELLOWS? WHAT WAS THE MOTIVE, WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF IT? TO UNITE SOCIETY? BUT, MERCY ON US! WILL THEY EVER BE UNITED?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHEN DID YOU WARN ME? ON THE CONTRARY, YOU APPROVED OF IT, YOU EVEN INSISTED ON IT.‚Ä¶ I CONFESS I AM SO SURPRISED.‚Ä¶ YOU BROUGHT ALL SORTS OF STRANGE PEOPLE TO SEE ME YOURSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚON THE CONTRARY, I OPPOSED YOU; I DID NOT APPROVE OF IT. AS FOR BRINGING THEM TO SEE YOU, I CERTAINLY DID, BUT ONLY AFTER THEY‚ÄÔD GOT IN BY DOZENS AND ONLY OF LATE TO MAKE UP ‚ÄÒTHE LITERARY QUADRILLE‚ÄÔ‚ÄÎWE COULDN‚ÄÔT GET ON WITHOUT THESE ROGUES. ONLY I DON‚ÄÔT MIND BETTING THAT A DOZEN OR TWO MORE OF THE SAME SORT WERE LET IN WITHOUT TICKETS TO-DAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOT A DOUBT OF IT,‚ÄÙ I AGREED.

‚ÄÚTHERE, YOU SEE, YOU ARE AGREEING ALREADY. THINK WHAT THE TONE HAS BEEN LATELY HERE‚ÄÎI MEAN IN THIS WRETCHED TOWN. IT‚ÄÔS NOTHING BUT INSOLENCE, IMPUDENCE; IT‚ÄÔS BEEN A CRYING SCANDAL ALL THE TIME. AND WHO‚ÄÔS BEEN ENCOURAGING IT? WHO‚ÄÔS SCREENED IT BY HER AUTHORITY? WHO‚ÄÔS UPSET THEM ALL? WHO HAS MADE ALL THE SMALL FRY HUFFY? ALL THEIR FAMILY SECRETS ARE CARICATURED IN YOUR ALBUM. DIDN‚ÄÔT YOU PAT THEM ON THE BACK, YOUR POETS AND CARICATURISTS? DIDN‚ÄÔT YOU LET LYAMSHIN KISS YOUR HAND? DIDN‚ÄÔT A DIVINITY STUDENT ABUSE AN ACTUAL STATE COUNCILLOR IN YOUR PRESENCE AND SPOIL HIS DAUGHTER‚ÄÔS DRESS WITH HIS TARRED BOOTS? NOW, CAN YOU WONDER THAT THE PUBLIC IS SET AGAINST YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT THAT‚ÄÔS ALL YOUR DOING, YOURS! OH, MY GOODNESS!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, I WARNED YOU. WE QUARRELLED. DO YOU HEAR, WE QUARRELLED?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, YOU ARE LYING TO MY FACE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOF COURSE IT‚ÄÔS EASY FOR YOU TO SAY THAT. YOU NEED A VICTIM TO VENT YOUR WRATH ON. WELL, VENT IT ON ME AS I‚ÄÔVE SAID ALREADY. I‚ÄÔD BETTER APPEAL TO YOU, MR.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ (HE WAS STILL UNABLE TO RECALL MY NAME.) ‚ÄÚWE‚ÄÔLL RECKON ON OUR FINGERS. I MAINTAIN THAT, APART FROM LIPUTIN, THERE WAS NOTHING PRECONCERTED, NOTHING! I WILL PROVE IT, BUT FIRST LET US ANALYSE LIPUTIN. HE CAME FORWARD WITH THAT FOOL LEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS VERSES. DO YOU MAINTAIN THAT THAT WAS A PLOT? BUT DO YOU KNOW IT MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE STRUCK LIPUTIN AS A CLEVER THING TO DO. SERIOUSLY, SERIOUSLY. HE SIMPLY CAME FORWARD WITH THE IDEA OF MAKING EVERY ONE LAUGH AND ENTERTAINING THEM‚ÄÎHIS PROTECTRESS YULIA MIHAILOVNA FIRST OF ALL. THAT WAS ALL. DON‚ÄÔT YOU BELIEVE IT? ISN‚ÄÔT THAT IN KEEPING WITH ALL THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON HERE FOR THE LAST MONTH? DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH? I DECLARE THAT UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES IT MIGHT HAVE GONE OFF ALL RIGHT. IT WAS A COARSE JOKE‚ÄÎWELL, A BIT STRONG, PERHAPS; BUT IT WAS AMUSING, YOU KNOW, WASN‚ÄÔT IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT! YOU THINK WHAT LIPUTIN DID WAS CLEVER?‚ÄÙ YULIA MIHAILOVNA CRIED IN INTENSE INDIGNATION. ‚ÄÚSUCH STUPIDITY, SUCH TACTLESSNESS, SO CONTEMPTIBLE, SO MEAN! IT WAS INTENTIONAL! OH, YOU ARE SAYING IT ON PURPOSE! I BELIEVE AFTER THAT YOU ARE IN THE PLOT WITH THEM YOURSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOF COURSE I WAS BEHIND THE SCENES, I WAS IN HIDING, I SET IT ALL GOING. BUT IF I WERE IN THE PLOT‚ÄÎUNDERSTAND THAT, ANYWAY‚ÄÎIT WOULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE ENDED WITH LIPUTIN. SO ACCORDING TO YOU I HAD ARRANGED WITH MY PAPA TOO THAT HE SHOULD CAUSE SUCH A SCENE ON PURPOSE? WELL, WHOSE FAULT IS IT THAT MY PAPA WAS ALLOWED TO READ? WHO TRIED ONLY YESTERDAY TO PREVENT YOU FROM ALLOWING IT, ONLY YESTERDAY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, HIER IL AVAIT TANT D‚ÄÔESPRIT, I WAS SO RECKONING ON HIM; AND THEN HE HAS SUCH MANNERS. I THOUGHT WITH HIM AND KARMAZINOV ‚Ä¶ ONLY THINK!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, ONLY THINK. BUT IN SPITE OF TANT D‚ÄÔESPRIT PAPA HAS MADE THINGS WORSE, AND IF I‚ÄÔD KNOWN BEFOREHAND THAT HE‚ÄÔD MAKE SUCH A MESS OF IT, I SHOULD CERTAINLY NOT HAVE PERSUADED YOU YESTERDAY TO KEEP THE GOAT OUT OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN, SHOULD I‚ÄÎSINCE I AM TAKING PART IN THIS CONSPIRACY AGAINST YOUR F√™TE THAT YOU ARE SO POSITIVE ABOUT? AND YET I DID TRY TO DISSUADE YOU YESTERDAY; I TRIED TO BECAUSE I FORESAW IT. TO FORESEE EVERYTHING WAS, OF COURSE, IMPOSSIBLE; HE PROBABLY DID NOT KNOW HIMSELF A MINUTE BEFORE WHAT HE WOULD FIRE OFF‚ÄÎTHESE NERVOUS OLD MEN CAN‚ÄÔT BE RECKONED ON LIKE OTHER PEOPLE. BUT YOU CAN STILL SAVE THE SITUATION: TO SATISFY THE PUBLIC, SEND TO HIM TO-MORROW BY ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER, AND WITH ALL THE CEREMONIES, TWO DOCTORS TO INQUIRE INTO HIS HEALTH. EVEN TO-DAY, IN FACT, AND TAKE HIM STRAIGHT TO THE HOSPITAL AND APPLY COLD COMPRESSES. EVERY ONE WOULD LAUGH, ANYWAY, AND SEE THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO TAKE OFFENCE AT. I‚ÄÔLL TELL PEOPLE ABOUT IT IN THE EVENING AT THE BALL, AS I AM HIS SON. KARMAZINOV IS ANOTHER STORY. HE WAS A PERFECT ASS AND DRAGGED OUT HIS ARTICLE FOR A WHOLE HOUR. HE CERTAINLY MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE PLOT WITH ME! ‚ÄÒI‚ÄÔLL MAKE A MESS OF IT TOO,‚ÄÔ HE THOUGHT, ‚ÄÒTO DAMAGE YULIA MIHAILOVNA.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, KARMAZINOV! QUELLE HONTE! I WAS BURNING, BURNING WITH SHAME FOR HIS AUDIENCE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, I SHOULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE BURNT, BUT HAVE COOKED HIM INSTEAD. THE AUDIENCE WAS RIGHT, YOU KNOW. WHO WAS TO BLAME FOR KARMAZINOV, AGAIN? DID I FOIST HIM UPON YOU? WAS I ONE OF HIS WORSHIPPERS? WELL, HANG HIM! BUT THE THIRD MANIAC, THE POLITICAL‚ÄÎTHAT‚ÄÔS A DIFFERENT MATTER. THAT WAS EVERY ONE‚ÄÔS BLUNDER, NOT ONLY MY PLOT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAH, DON‚ÄÔT SPEAK OF IT! THAT WAS AWFUL, AWFUL! THAT WAS MY FAULT, ENTIRELY MY FAULT!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOF COURSE IT WAS, BUT I DON‚ÄÔT BLAME YOU FOR THAT. NO ONE CAN CONTROL THEM, THESE CANDID SOULS! YOU CAN‚ÄÔT ALWAYS BE SAFE FROM THEM, EVEN IN PETERSBURG. HE WAS RECOMMENDED TO YOU, AND IN WHAT TERMS TOO! SO YOU WILL ADMIT THAT YOU ARE BOUND TO APPEAR AT THE BALL TO-NIGHT. IT‚ÄÔS AN IMPORTANT BUSINESS. IT WAS YOU PUT HIM ON TO THE PLATFORM. YOU MUST MAKE IT PLAIN NOW TO THE PUBLIC THAT YOU ARE NOT IN LEAGUE WITH HIM, THAT THE FELLOW IS IN THE HANDS OF THE POLICE, AND THAT YOU WERE IN SOME INEXPLICABLE WAY DECEIVED. YOU OUGHT TO DECLARE WITH INDIGNATION THAT YOU WERE THE VICTIM OF A MADMAN. BECAUSE HE IS A MADMAN AND NOTHING MORE. THAT‚ÄÔS HOW YOU MUST PUT IT ABOUT HIM. I CAN‚ÄÔT ENDURE THESE PEOPLE WHO BITE. I SAY WORSE THINGS PERHAPS, BUT NOT FROM THE PLATFORM, YOU KNOW. AND THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT A SENATOR TOO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT SENATOR? WHO‚ÄÔS TALKING?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF, YOU KNOW. DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A SENATOR, YULIA MIHAILOVNA?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚA SENATOR?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU SEE, THEY ARE CONVINCED THAT A SENATOR HAS BEEN APPOINTED TO BE GOVERNOR HERE, AND THAT YOU ARE BEING SUPERSEDED FROM PETERSBURG. I‚ÄÔVE HEARD IT FROM LOTS OF PEOPLE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE HEARD IT TOO,‚ÄÙ I PUT IN.

‚ÄÚWHO SAID SO?‚ÄÙ ASKED YULIA MIHAILOVNA, FLUSHING ALL OVER.

‚ÄÚYOU MEAN, WHO SAID SO FIRST? HOW CAN I TELL? BUT THERE IT IS, PEOPLE SAY SO. MASSES OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING SO. THEY WERE SAYING SO YESTERDAY PARTICULARLY. THEY ARE ALL VERY SERIOUS ABOUT IT, THOUGH I CAN‚ÄÔT MAKE IT OUT. OF COURSE THE MORE INTELLIGENT AND COMPETENT DON‚ÄÔT TALK, BUT EVEN SOME OF THOSE LISTEN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW MEAN! AND ‚Ä¶ HOW STUPID!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, THAT‚ÄÔS JUST WHY YOU MUST MAKE YOUR APPEARANCE, TO SHOW THESE FOOLS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI CONFESS I FEEL MYSELF THAT IT‚ÄÔS MY DUTY, BUT ‚Ä¶ WHAT IF THERE‚ÄÔS ANOTHER DISGRACE IN STORE FOR US? WHAT IF PEOPLE DON‚ÄÔT COME? NO ONE WILL COME, YOU KNOW, NO ONE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW HOT YOU ARE! THEY NOT COME! WHAT ABOUT THE NEW CLOTHES? WHAT ABOUT THE GIRLS‚ÄÔ DRESSES? I GIVE YOU UP AS A WOMAN AFTER THAT! IS THAT YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE MARSHAL‚ÄÔS WIFE WON‚ÄÔT COME, SHE WON‚ÄÔT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT, AFTER ALL, WHAT HAS HAPPENED? WHY WON‚ÄÔT THEY COME?‚ÄÙ HE CRIED AT LAST WITH ANGRY IMPATIENCE.

‚ÄÚIGNOMINY, DISGRACE‚ÄÎTHAT‚ÄÔS WHAT‚ÄÔS HAPPENED. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT, BUT AFTER IT I CAN‚ÄÔT FACE PEOPLE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY? HOW ARE YOU TO BLAME FOR IT, AFTER ALL? WHY DO YOU TAKE THE BLAME OF IT ON YOURSELF? ISN‚ÄÔT IT RATHER THE FAULT OF THE AUDIENCE, OF YOUR RESPECTABLE RESIDENTS, YOUR PATRESFAMILIAS? THEY OUGHT TO HAVE CONTROLLED THE ROUGHS AND THE ROWDIES‚ÄÎFOR IT WAS ALL THE WORK OF ROUGHS AND ROWDIES, NOTHING SERIOUS. YOU CAN NEVER MANAGE THINGS WITH THE POLICE ALONE IN ANY SOCIETY, ANYWHERE. AMONG US EVERY ONE ASKS FOR A SPECIAL POLICEMAN TO PROTECT HIM WHEREVER HE GOES. PEOPLE DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND THAT SOCIETY MUST PROTECT ITSELF. AND WHAT DO OUR PATRESFAMILIAS, THE OFFICIALS, THE WIVES AND DAUGHTERS, DO IN SUCH CASES? THEY SIT QUIET AND SULK. IN FACT THERE‚ÄÔS NOT ENOUGH SOCIAL INITIATIVE TO KEEP THE DISORDERLY IN CHECK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAH, THAT‚ÄÔS THE SIMPLE TRUTH! THEY SIT QUIET, SULK AND ‚Ä¶ GAZE ABOUT THEM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND IF IT‚ÄÔS THE TRUTH, YOU OUGHT TO SAY SO ALOUD, PROUDLY, STERNLY, JUST TO SHOW THAT YOU ARE NOT DEFEATED, TO THOSE RESPECTABLE RESIDENTS AND MOTHERS OF FAMILIES. OH, YOU CAN DO IT; YOU HAVE THE GIFT WHEN YOUR HEAD IS CLEAR. YOU WILL GATHER THEM ROUND YOU AND SAY IT ALOUD. AND THEN A PARAGRAPH IN THE VOICE AND THE FINANCIAL NEWS. WAIT A BIT, I‚ÄÔLL UNDERTAKE IT MYSELF, I‚ÄÔLL ARRANGE IT ALL FOR YOU. OF COURSE THERE MUST BE MORE SUPERINTENDENCE: YOU MUST LOOK AFTER THE BUFFET; YOU MUST ASK THE PRINCE, YOU MUST ASK MR.‚Ä¶ YOU MUST NOT DESERT US, MONSIEUR, JUST WHEN WE HAVE TO BEGIN ALL OVER AGAIN. AND FINALLY, YOU MUST APPEAR ARM-IN-ARM WITH ANDREY ANTONOVITCH.‚Ä¶ HOW IS ANDREY ANTONOVITCH?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, HOW UNJUSTLY, HOW UNTRULY, HOW CRUELLY YOU HAVE ALWAYS JUDGED THAT ANGELIC MAN!‚ÄÙ YULIA MIHAILOVNA CRIED IN A SUDDEN, OUTBURST, ALMOST WITH TEARS, PUTTING HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER EYES.

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS POSITIVELY TAKEN ABACK FOR THE MOMENT. ‚ÄÚGOOD HEAVENS! I.‚Ä¶ WHAT HAVE I SAID? I‚ÄÔVE ALWAYS ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU NEVER HAVE, NEVER! YOU HAVE NEVER DONE HIM JUSTICE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHERE‚ÄÔS NO UNDERSTANDING A WOMAN,‚ÄÙ GRUMBLED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WITH A WRY SMILE.

‚ÄÚHE IS THE MOST SINCERE, THE MOST DELICATE, THE MOST ANGELIC OF MEN! THE MOST KIND-HEARTED OF MEN!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, REALLY, AS FOR KIND-HEARTEDNESS ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔVE ALWAYS DONE HIM JUSTICE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNEVER! BUT LET US DROP IT. I AM TOO AWKWARD IN MY DEFENCE OF HIM. THIS MORNING THAT LITTLE JESUIT, THE MARSHAL‚ÄÔS WIFE, ALSO DROPPED SOME SARCASTIC HINTS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, SHE HAS NO THOUGHTS TO SPARE FOR YESTERDAY NOW, SHE IS FULL OF TO-DAY. AND WHY ARE YOU SO UPSET AT HER NOT COMING TO THE BALL TO-NIGHT? OF COURSE, SHE WON‚ÄÔT COME AFTER GETTING MIXED UP IN SUCH A SCANDAL. PERHAPS IT‚ÄÔS NOT HER FAULT, BUT STILL HER REPUTATION ‚Ä¶ HER HANDS ARE SOILED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU MEAN; I DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND? WHY ARE HER HANDS SOILED?‚ÄÙ YULIA MIHAILOVNA LOOKED AT HIM IN PERPLEXITY.

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT VOUCH FOR THE TRUTH OF IT, BUT THE TOWN IS RINGING WITH THE STORY THAT IT WAS SHE BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU MEAN? BROUGHT WHOM TOGETHER?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT, DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU DON‚ÄÔT KNOW?‚ÄÙ HE EXCLAIMED WITH WELL-SIMULATED WONDER. ‚ÄÚWHY STAVROGIN AND LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT? HOW?‚ÄÙ WE ALL CRIED OUT AT ONCE.

‚ÄÚIS IT POSSIBLE YOU DON‚ÄÔT KNOW? PHEW! WHY, IT IS QUITE A TRAGIC ROMANCE: LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA WAS PLEASED TO GET OUT OF THAT LADY‚ÄÔS CARRIAGE AND GET STRAIGHT INTO STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS CARRIAGE, AND SLIPPED OFF WITH ‚ÄÒTHE LATTER‚ÄÔ TO SKVORESHNIKI IN FULL DAYLIGHT. ONLY AN HOUR AGO, HARDLY AN HOUR.‚ÄÙ

WE WERE FLABBERGASTED. OF COURSE WE FELL TO QUESTIONING HIM, BUT TO OUR WONDER, ALTHOUGH HE ‚ÄÚHAPPENED‚ÄÙ TO BE A WITNESS OF THE SCENE HIMSELF, HE COULD GIVE US NO DETAILED ACCOUNT OF IT. THE THING SEEMED TO HAVE HAPPENED LIKE THIS: WHEN THE MARSHAL‚ÄÔS WIFE WAS DRIVING LIZA AND MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH FROM THE MATIN√©E TO THE HOUSE OF PRASKOVYA IVANOVNA (WHOSE LEGS WERE STILL BAD) THEY SAW A CARRIAGE WAITING A SHORT DISTANCE, ABOUT TWENTY-FIVE PACES, TO ONE SIDE OF THE FRONT DOOR. WHEN LIZA JUMPED OUT, SHE RAN STRAIGHT TO THIS CARRIAGE; THE DOOR WAS FLUNG OPEN AND SHUT AGAIN; LIZA CALLED TO MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, ‚ÄÚSPARE ME,‚ÄÙ AND THE CARRIAGE DROVE OFF AT FULL SPEED TO SKVORESHNIKI. TO OUR HURRIED QUESTIONS WHETHER IT WAS BY ARRANGEMENT? WHO WAS IN THE CARRIAGE? PYOTR STEPANOVITCH ANSWERED THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT; NO DOUBT IT HAD BEEN ARRANGED, BUT THAT HE DID NOT SEE STAVROGIN HIMSELF; POSSIBLY THE OLD BUTLER, ALEXEY YEGORYTCH, MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE CARRIAGE. TO THE QUESTION ‚ÄÚHOW DID HE COME TO BE THERE, AND HOW DID HE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT SHE HAD DRIVEN TO SKVORESHNIKI?‚ÄÙ HE ANSWERED THAT HE HAPPENED TO BE PASSING AND, AT SEEING LIZA, HE HAD RUN UP TO THE CARRIAGE (AND YET HE COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHO WAS IN IT, AN INQUISITIVE MAN LIKE HIM!) AND THAT MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, FAR FROM SETTING OFF IN PURSUIT, HAD NOT EVEN TRIED TO STOP LIZA, AND HAD EVEN LAID A RESTRAINING HAND ON THE MARSHAL‚ÄÔS WIFE, WHO WAS SHOUTING AT THE TOP OF HER VOICE: ‚ÄÚSHE IS GOING TO STAVROGIN, TO STAVROGIN.‚ÄÙ AT THIS POINT I LOST PATIENCE, AND CRIED FURIOUSLY TO PYOTR STEPANOVITCH:

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS ALL YOUR DOING, YOU RASCAL! THIS WAS WHAT YOU WERE DOING THIS MORNING. YOU HELPED STAVROGIN, YOU CAME IN THE CARRIAGE, YOU HELPED HER INTO IT ‚Ä¶ IT WAS YOU, YOU, YOU! YULIA MIHAILOVNA, HE IS YOUR ENEMY; HE WILL BE YOUR RUIN TOO! BEWARE OF HIM!‚ÄÙ

AND I RAN HEADLONG OUT OF THE HOUSE. I WONDER MYSELF AND CANNOT MAKE OUT TO THIS DAY HOW I CAME TO SAY THAT TO HIM. BUT I GUESSED QUITE RIGHT: IT HAD ALL HAPPENED ALMOST EXACTLY AS I SAID, AS APPEARED LATER. WHAT STRUCK ME MOST WAS THE OBVIOUSLY ARTIFICIAL WAY IN WHICH HE BROKE THE NEWS. HE HAD NOT TOLD IT AT ONCE ON ENTERING THE HOUSE AS AN EXTRAORDINARY PIECE OF NEWS, BUT PRETENDED THAT WE KNEW WITHOUT HIS TELLING US WHICH WAS IMPOSSIBLE IN SO SHORT A TIME. AND IF WE HAD KNOWN IT, WE COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE REFRAINED FROM MENTIONING IT TILL HE INTRODUCED THE SUBJECT. BESIDES, HE COULD NOT HAVE HEARD YET THAT THE TOWN WAS ‚ÄÚRINGING WITH GOSSIP‚ÄÙ ABOUT THE MARSHAL‚ÄÔS WIFE IN SO SHORT A TIME. BESIDES, HE HAD ONCE OR TWICE GIVEN A VULGAR, FRIVOLOUS SMILE AS HE TOLD THE STORY, PROBABLY CONSIDERING THAT WE WERE FOOLS AND COMPLETELY TAKEN IN.

BUT I HAD NO THOUGHT TO SPARE FOR HIM; THE CENTRAL FACT I BELIEVED, AND RAN FROM YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS, BESIDE MYSELF. THE CATASTROPHE CUT ME TO THE HEART. I WAS WOUNDED ALMOST TO TEARS; PERHAPS I DID SHED SOME INDEED. I WAS AT A COMPLETE LOSS WHAT TO DO. I RUSHED TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS, BUT THE VEXATIOUS MAN STILL REFUSED TO OPEN THE DOOR. NASTASYA INFORMED ME, IN A REVERENT WHISPER, THAT HE HAD GONE TO BED, BUT I DID NOT BELIEVE IT. AT LIZA‚ÄÔS HOUSE I SUCCEEDED IN QUESTIONING THE SERVANTS. THEY CONFIRMED THE STORY OF THE ELOPEMENT, BUT KNEW NOTHING THEMSELVES. THERE WAS GREAT COMMOTION IN THE HOUSE; THEIR MISTRESS HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY FAINTING FITS, AND MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH WAS WITH HER. I DID NOT FEEL IT POSSIBLE TO ASK FOR MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH. TO MY INQUIRIES ABOUT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH THEY TOLD ME THAT HE HAD BEEN IN AND OUT CONTINUALLY OF LATE, SOMETIMES TWICE IN THE DAY. THE SERVANTS WERE SAD, AND SHOWED PARTICULAR RESPECTFULNESS IN SPEAKING OF LIZA; THEY WERE FOND OF HER. THAT SHE WAS RUINED, UTTERLY RUINED, I DID NOT DOUBT; BUT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECT OF THE MATTER I WAS UTTERLY UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND, ESPECIALLY AFTER HER SCENE WITH STAVROGIN THE PREVIOUS DAY. TO RUN ABOUT THE TOWN AND INQUIRE AT THE HOUSES OF ACQUAINTANCES, WHO WOULD, OF COURSE, BY NOW HAVE HEARD THE NEWS AND BE REJOICING AT IT, SEEMED TO ME REVOLTING, BESIDES BEING HUMILIATING FOR LIZA. BUT, STRANGE TO SAY, I RAN TO SEE DARYA PAVLOVNA, THOUGH I WAS NOT ADMITTED (NO ONE HAD BEEN ADMITTED INTO THE HOUSE SINCE THE PREVIOUS MORNING). I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT I COULD HAVE SAID TO HER AND WHAT MADE ME RUN TO HER. FROM HER I WENT TO HER BROTHER‚ÄÔS. SHATOV LISTENED SULLENLY AND IN SILENCE. I MAY OBSERVE THAT I FOUND HIM MORE GLOOMY THAN I HAD EVER SEEN HIM BEFORE; HE WAS AWFULLY PREOCCUPIED AND SEEMED ONLY TO LISTEN TO ME WITH AN EFFORT. HE SAID SCARCELY ANYTHING AND BEGAN WALKING UP AND DOWN HIS CELL FROM CORNER TO CORNER, TREADING MORE NOISILY THAN USUAL. AS I WAS GOING DOWN THE STAIRS HE SHOUTED AFTER ME TO GO TO LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS: ‚ÄÚTHERE YOU‚ÄÔLL HEAR EVERYTHING.‚ÄÙ YET I DID NOT GO TO LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS, BUT AFTER I‚ÄÔD GONE A GOOD WAY TOWARDS HOME I TURNED BACK TO SHATOV‚ÄÔS AGAIN, AND, HALF OPENING THE DOOR WITHOUT GOING IN, SUGGESTED TO HIM LACONICALLY AND WITH NO KIND OF EXPLANATION, ‚ÄÚWON‚ÄÔT YOU GO TO MARYA TIMOFYEVNA TO-DAY?‚ÄÙ AT THIS SHATOV SWORE AT ME, AND I WENT AWAY. I NOTE HERE THAT I MAY NOT FORGET IT THAT HE DID PURPOSELY GO THAT EVENING TO THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN TO SEE MARYA TIMOFYEVNA, WHOM HE HAD NOT SEEN FOR SOME TIME. HE FOUND HER IN EXCELLENT HEALTH AND SPIRITS AND LEBYADKIN DEAD DRUNK, ASLEEP ON THE SOFA IN THE FIRST ROOM. THIS WAS AT NINE O‚ÄÔCLOCK. HE TOLD ME SO HIMSELF NEXT DAY WHEN WE MET FOR A MOMENT IN THE STREET. BEFORE TEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK I MADE UP MY MIND TO GO TO THE BALL, BUT NOT IN THE CAPACITY OF A STEWARD (BESIDES MY ROSETTE HAD BEEN LEFT AT YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS). I WAS TEMPTED BY IRRESISTIBLE CURIOSITY TO LISTEN, WITHOUT ASKING ANY QUESTIONS, TO WHAT PEOPLE WERE SAYING IN THE TOWN ABOUT ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED. I WANTED, TOO, TO HAVE A LOOK AT YULIA MIHAILOVNA, IF ONLY AT A DISTANCE. I REPROACHED MYSELF GREATLY THAT I HAD LEFT HER SO ABRUPTLY THAT AFTERNOON.

III

ALL THAT NIGHT, WITH ITS ALMOST GROTESQUE INCIDENTS, AND THE TERRIBLE D√©NOUEMENT THAT FOLLOWED IN THE EARLY MORNING, STILL SEEMS TO ME LIKE A HIDEOUS NIGHTMARE, AND IS, FOR ME AT LEAST, THE MOST PAINFUL CHAPTER IN MY CHRONICLE. I WAS LATE FOR THE BALL, AND IT WAS DESTINED TO END SO QUICKLY THAT I ARRIVED NOT LONG BEFORE IT WAS OVER. IT WAS ELEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK WHEN I REACHED THE ENTRANCE OF THE MARSHAL‚ÄÔS HOUSE, WHERE THE SAME WHITE HALL IN WHICH THE MATIN√©E HAD TAKEN PLACE HAD, IN SPITE OF THE SHORT INTERVAL BETWEEN, BEEN CLEARED AND MADE READY TO SERVE AS THE CHIEF BALLROOM FOR THE WHOLE TOWN, AS WE EXPECTED, TO DANCE IN. BUT FAR AS I HAD BEEN THAT MORNING FROM EXPECTING THE BALL TO BE A SUCCESS, I HAD HAD NO PRESENTIMENT OF THE FULL TRUTH. NOT ONE FAMILY OF THE HIGHER CIRCLES APPEARED; EVEN THE SUBORDINATE OFFICIALS OF RATHER MORE CONSEQUENCE WERE ABSENT‚ÄÎAND THIS WAS A VERY STRIKING FACT. AS FOR LADIES AND GIRLS, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS ARGUMENTS (THE DUPLICITY OF WHICH WAS OBVIOUS NOW) TURNED OUT TO BE UTTERLY INCORRECT: EXCEEDINGLY FEW HAD COME; TO FOUR MEN THERE WAS SCARCELY ONE LADY‚ÄÎAND WHAT LADIES THEY WERE! REGIMENTAL LADIES OF A SORT, THREE DOCTORS‚ÄÔ WIVES WITH THEIR DAUGHTERS, TWO OR THREE POOR LADIES FROM THE COUNTRY, THE SEVEN DAUGHTERS AND THE NIECE OF THE SECRETARY WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED ALREADY, SOME WIVES OF TRADESMEN, OF POST-OFFICE CLERKS AND OTHER SMALL FRY‚ÄÎWAS THIS WHAT YULIA MIHAILOVNA EXPECTED? HALF THE TRADESPEOPLE EVEN WERE ABSENT. AS FOR THE MEN, IN SPITE OF THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ALL PERSONS OF CONSEQUENCE, THERE WAS STILL A CROWD OF THEM, BUT THEY MADE A DOUBTFUL AND SUSPICIOUS IMPRESSION. THERE WERE, OF COURSE, SOME QUIET AND RESPECTFUL OFFICERS WITH THEIR WIVES, SOME OF THE MOST DOCILE FATHERS OF FAMILIES, LIKE THAT SECRETARY, FOR INSTANCE, THE FATHER OF HIS SEVEN DAUGHTERS. ALL THESE HUMBLE, INSIGNIFICANT PEOPLE HAD COME, AS ONE OF THESE GENTLEMEN EXPRESSED IT, BECAUSE IT WAS ‚ÄÚINEVITABLE.‚ÄÙ BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE MASS OF FREE-AND-EASY PEOPLE AND THE MASS TOO OF THOSE WHOM PYOTR STEPANOVITCH AND I HAD SUSPECTED OF COMING IN WITHOUT TICKETS, SEEMED EVEN BIGGER THAN IN THE AFTERNOON. SO FAR THEY WERE ALL SITTING IN THE REFRESHMENT BAR, AND HAD GONE STRAIGHT THERE ON ARRIVING, AS THOUGH IT WERE THE MEETING-PLACE THEY HAD AGREED UPON. SO AT LEAST IT SEEMED TO ME. THE REFRESHMENT BAR HAD BEEN PLACED IN A LARGE ROOM, THE LAST OF SEVERAL OPENING OUT OF ONE ANOTHER. HERE PROHORITCH WAS INSTALLED WITH ALL THE ATTRACTIONS OF THE CLUB CUISINE AND WITH A TEMPTING DISPLAY OF DRINKS AND DAINTIES. I NOTICED SEVERAL PERSONS WHOSE COATS WERE ALMOST IN RAGS AND WHOSE GET-UP WAS ALTOGETHER SUSPICIOUS AND UTTERLY UNSUITABLE FOR A BALL. THEY HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN WITH GREAT PAINS BROUGHT TO A STATE OF PARTIAL SOBRIETY WHICH WOULD NOT LAST LONG; AND GOODNESS KNOWS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT FROM, THEY WERE NOT LOCAL PEOPLE. I KNEW, OF COURSE, THAT IT WAS PART OF YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS IDEA THAT THE BALL SHOULD BE OF THE MOST DEMOCRATIC CHARACTER, AND THAT ‚ÄÚEVEN WORKING PEOPLE AND SHOPMEN SHOULD NOT BE EXCLUDED IF ANY ONE OF THAT CLASS CHANCED TO PAY FOR A TICKET.‚ÄÙ SHE COULD BRAVELY UTTER SUCH WORDS IN HER COMMITTEE WITH ABSOLUTE SECURITY THAT NONE OF THE WORKING PEOPLE OF OUR TOWN, WHO ALL LIVED IN EXTREME POVERTY, WOULD DREAM OF TAKING A TICKET. BUT IN SPITE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SENTIMENTS OF THE COMMITTEE, I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT SUCH SINISTER-LOOKING AND SHABBY PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN ADMITTED IN THE REGULAR WAY. BUT WHO COULD HAVE ADMITTED THEM, AND WITH WHAT OBJECT? LYAMSHIN AND LIPUTIN HAD ALREADY BEEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR STEWARD‚ÄÔS ROSETTES, THOUGH THEY WERE PRESENT AT THE BALL, AS THEY WERE TAKING PART IN THE ‚ÄÚLITERARY QUADRILLE.‚ÄÙ BUT, TO MY AMAZEMENT, LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS PLACE WAS TAKEN BY THE DIVINITY STUDENT, WHO HAD CAUSED THE GREATEST SCANDAL AT THE MATIN√©E BY HIS SKIRMISH WITH STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH; AND LYAMSHIN‚ÄÔS WAS TAKEN BY PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HIMSELF. WHAT WAS TO BE LOOKED FOR UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES?

I TRIED TO LISTEN TO THE CONVERSATION. I WAS STRUCK BY THE WILDNESS OF SOME IDEAS I HEARD EXPRESSED. IT WAS MAINTAINED IN ONE GROUP, FOR INSTANCE, THAT YULIA MIHAILOVNA HAD ARRANGED LIZA‚ÄÔS ELOPEMENT WITH STAVROGIN AND HAD BEEN PAID BY THE LATTER FOR DOING SO. EVEN THE SUM PAID WAS MENTIONED. IT WAS ASSERTED THAT SHE HAD ARRANGED THE WHOLE F√™TE WITH A VIEW TO IT, AND THAT THAT WAS THE REASON WHY HALF THE TOWN HAD NOT TURNED UP AT THE BALL, AND THAT LEMBKE HIMSELF WAS SO UPSET ABOUT IT THAT ‚ÄÚHIS MIND HAD GIVEN WAY,‚ÄÙ AND THAT, CRAZY AS HE WAS, ‚ÄÚSHE HAD GOT HIM IN TOW.‚ÄÙ THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF LAUGHTER TOO, HOARSE, WILD AND SIGNIFICANT. EVERY ONE WAS CRITICISING THE BALL, TOO, WITH GREAT SEVERITY, AND ABUSING YULIA MIHAILOVNA WITHOUT CEREMONY. IN FACT IT WAS DISORDERLY, INCOHERENT, DRUNKEN AND EXCITED BABBLE, SO IT WAS DIFFICULT TO PUT IT TOGETHER AND MAKE ANYTHING OF IT. AT THE SAME TIME THERE WERE SIMPLE-HEARTED PEOPLE ENJOYING THEMSELVES AT THE REFRESHMENT-BAR; THERE WERE EVEN SOME LADIES OF THE SORT WHO ARE SURPRISED AND FRIGHTENED AT NOTHING, VERY GENIAL AND FESTIVE, CHIEFLY MILITARY LADIES WITH THEIR HUSBANDS. THEY MADE PARTIES AT THE LITTLE TABLES, WERE DRINKING TEA, AND WERE VERY MERRY. THE REFRESHMENT-BAR MADE A SNUG REFUGE FOR ALMOST HALF OF THE GUESTS. YET IN A LITTLE TIME ALL THIS MASS OF PEOPLE MUST STREAM INTO THE BALLROOM. IT WAS HORRIBLE TO THINK OF IT!

MEANWHILE THE PRINCE HAD SUCCEEDED IN ARRANGING THREE SKIMPY QUADRILLES IN THE WHITE HALL. THE YOUNG LADIES WERE DANCING, WHILE THEIR PARENTS WERE ENJOYING WATCHING THEM. BUT MANY OF THESE RESPECTABLE PERSONS HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO THINK HOW THEY COULD, AFTER GIVING THEIR GIRLS A TREAT, GET OFF IN GOOD TIME BEFORE ‚ÄÚTHE TROUBLE BEGAN.‚ÄÙ ABSOLUTELY EVERY ONE WAS CONVINCED THAT IT CERTAINLY WOULD BEGIN. IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DESCRIBE YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS STATE OF MIND. I DID NOT TALK TO HER THOUGH I WENT CLOSE UP TO HER. SHE DID NOT RESPOND TO THE BOW I MADE HER ON ENTERING; SHE DID NOT NOTICE ME (REALLY DID NOT NOTICE). THERE WAS A PAINFUL LOOK IN HER FACE AND A CONTEMPTUOUS AND HAUGHTY THOUGH RESTLESS AND AGITATED EXPRESSION IN HER EYES. SHE CONTROLLED HERSELF WITH EVIDENT SUFFERING‚ÄÎFOR WHOSE SAKE, WITH WHAT OBJECT? SHE CERTAINLY OUGHT TO HAVE GONE AWAY, STILL MORE TO HAVE GOT HER HUSBAND AWAY, AND SHE REMAINED! FROM HER FACE ONE COULD SEE THAT HER EYES WERE ‚ÄÚFULLY OPENED,‚ÄÙ AND THAT IT WAS USELESS FOR HER TO EXPECT ANY THING MORE. SHE DID NOT EVEN SUMMON PYOTR STEPANOVITCH (HE SEEMED TO AVOID HER; I SAW HIM IN THE REFRESHMENT-ROOM, HE WAS EXTREMELY LIVELY). BUT SHE REMAINED AT THE BALL AND DID NOT LET ANDREY ANTONOVITCH LEAVE HER SIDE FOR A MOMENT. OH, UP TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT, EVEN THAT MORNING SHE WOULD HAVE REPUDIATED ANY HINT ABOUT HIS HEALTH WITH GENUINE INDIGNATION. BUT NOW HER EYES WERE TO BE OPENED ON THIS SUBJECT TOO. AS FOR ME, I THOUGHT FROM THE FIRST GLANCE THAT ANDREY ANTONOVITCH LOOKED WORSE THAN HE HAD DONE IN THE MORNING. HE SEEMED TO BE PLUNGED INTO A SORT OF OBLIVION AND HARDLY TO KNOW WHERE HE WAS. SOMETIMES HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM WITH UNEXPECTED SEVERITY‚ÄÎAT ME, FOR INSTANCE, TWICE. ONCE HE TRIED TO SAY SOMETHING; HE BEGAN LOUDLY AND AUDIBLY BUT DID NOT FINISH THE SENTENCE, THROWING A MODEST OLD CLERK WHO HAPPENED TO BE NEAR HIM ALMOST INTO A PANIC. BUT EVEN THIS HUMBLE SECTION OF THE ASSEMBLY HELD SULLENLY AND TIMIDLY ALOOF FROM YULIA MIHAILOVNA AND AT THE SAME TIME TURNED UPON HER HUSBAND EXCEEDINGLY STRANGE GLANCES, OPEN AND STARING, QUITE OUT OF KEEPING WITH THEIR HABITUALLY SUBMISSIVE DEMEANOUR.

‚ÄÚYES, THAT STRUCK ME, AND I SUDDENLY BEGAN TO GUESS ABOUT ANDREY ANTONOVITCH,‚ÄÙ YULIA MIHAILOVNA CONFESSED TO ME AFTERWARDS.

YES, SHE WAS TO BLAME AGAIN! PROBABLY WHEN AFTER MY DEPARTURE SHE HAD SETTLED WITH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH THAT THERE SHOULD BE A BALL AND THAT SHE SHOULD BE PRESENT SHE MUST HAVE GONE AGAIN TO THE STUDY WHERE ANDREY ANTONOVITCH WAS SITTING, UTTERLY ‚ÄÚSHATTERED‚ÄÙ BY THE MATIN√©E; MUST AGAIN HAVE USED ALL HER FASCINATIONS TO PERSUADE HIM TO COME WITH HER. BUT WHAT MISERY SHE MUST HAVE BEEN IN NOW! AND YET SHE DID NOT GO AWAY. WHETHER IT WAS PRIDE OR SIMPLY SHE LOST HER HEAD, I DO NOT KNOW. IN SPITE OF HER HAUGHTINESS, SHE ATTEMPTED WITH SMILES AND HUMILIATION TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION WITH SOME LADIES, BUT THEY WERE CONFUSED, CONFINED THEMSELVES TO DISTRUSTFUL MONOSYLLABLES, ‚ÄÚYES‚ÄÙ AND ‚ÄÚNO,‚ÄÙ AND EVIDENTLY AVOIDED HER.

THE ONLY PERSON OF UNDOUBTED CONSEQUENCE WHO WAS PRESENT AT THE BALL WAS THAT DISTINGUISHED GENERAL WHOM I HAVE DESCRIBED ALREADY, THE ONE WHO AFTER STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS DUEL WITH GAGANOV OPENED THE DOOR TO PUBLIC IMPATIENCE AT THE MARSHAL‚ÄÔS WIFE‚ÄÔS. HE WALKED WITH AN AIR OF DIGNITY THROUGH THE ROOMS, LOOKED ABOUT, AND LISTENED, AND TRIED TO APPEAR AS THOUGH HE HAD COME RATHER FOR THE SAKE OF OBSERVATION THAN FOR THE SAKE OF ENJOYING HIMSELF.‚Ä¶ HE ENDED BY ESTABLISHING HIMSELF BESIDE YULIA MIHAILOVNA AND NOT MOVING A STEP AWAY FROM HER, EVIDENTLY TRYING TO KEEP UP HER SPIRITS, AND REASSURE HER. HE CERTAINLY WAS A MOST KIND-HEARTED MAN, OF VERY HIGH RANK, AND SO OLD THAT EVEN COMPASSION FROM HIM WAS NOT WOUNDING. BUT TO ADMIT TO HERSELF THAT THIS OLD GOSSIP WAS VENTURING TO PITY HER AND ALMOST TO PROTECT HER, KNOWING THAT HE WAS DOING HER HONOUR BY HIS PRESENCE, WAS VERY VEXATIOUS. THE GENERAL STAYED BY HER AND NEVER CEASED CHATTERING.

‚ÄÚTHEY SAY A TOWN CAN‚ÄÔT GO ON WITHOUT SEVEN RIGHTEOUS MEN ‚Ä¶ SEVEN, I THINK IT IS, I AM NOT SURE OF THE NUMBER FIXED.‚Ä¶ I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HOW MANY OF THESE SEVEN, THE CERTIFIED RIGHTEOUS OF THE TOWN ‚Ä¶ HAVE THE HONOUR OF BEING PRESENT AT YOUR BALL. YET IN SPITE OF THEIR PRESENCE I BEGIN TO FEEL UNSAFE. VOUS ME PARDONNEZ, CHARMANTE DAME, N‚ÄÔEST-CE PAS? I SPEAK ALLEGORICALLY, BUT I WENT INTO THE REFRESHMENT-ROOM AND I AM GLAD I ESCAPED ALIVE.‚Ä¶ OUR PRICELESS PROHORITCH IS NOT IN HIS PLACE THERE, AND I BELIEVE HIS BAR WILL BE DESTROYED BEFORE MORNING. BUT I AM LAUGHING. I AM ONLY WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE ‚ÄÒLITERARY QUADRILLE‚ÄÔ IS GOING TO BE LIKE, AND THEN HOME TO BED. YOU MUST EXCUSE A GOUTY OLD FELLOW. I GO EARLY TO BED, AND I WOULD ADVISE YOU TOO TO GO ‚ÄÒBY-BY,‚ÄÔ AS THEY SAY AUX ENFANTS. I‚ÄÔVE COME, YOU KNOW, TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE PRETTY GIRLS ‚Ä¶ WHOM, OF COURSE, I COULD MEET NOWHERE IN SUCH PROFUSION AS HERE. THEY ALL LIVE BEYOND THE RIVER AND I DON‚ÄÔT DRIVE OUT SO FAR. THERE‚ÄÔS A WIFE OF AN OFFICER ‚Ä¶ IN THE CHASSEURS I BELIEVE HE IS ‚Ä¶ WHO IS DISTINCTLY PRETTY, DISTINCTLY, AND ‚Ä¶ SHE KNOWS IT HERSELF. I‚ÄÔVE TALKED TO THE SLY PUSS; SHE IS A SPRIGHTLY ONE ‚Ä¶ AND THE GIRLS TOO ARE FRESH-LOOKING; BUT THAT‚ÄÔS ALL, THERE‚ÄÔS NOTHING BUT FRESHNESS. STILL, IT‚ÄÔS A PLEASURE TO LOOK AT THEM. THERE ARE SOME ROSEBUDS, BUT THEIR LIPS ARE THICK. AS A RULE THERE‚ÄÔS AN IRREGULARITY ABOUT FEMALE BEAUTY IN RUSSIA, AND ‚Ä¶ THEY ARE A LITTLE LIKE BUNS.‚Ä¶ VOUS ME PARDONNEZ, N‚ÄÔEST-CE PAS? ‚Ä¶ WITH GOOD EYES, HOWEVER, LAUGHING EYES.‚Ä¶ THESE ROSE BUDS ARE CHARMING FOR TWO YEARS WHEN THEY ARE YOUNG ‚Ä¶ EVEN FOR THREE ‚Ä¶ THEN THEY BROADEN OUT AND ARE SPOILT FOREVER ‚Ä¶ PRODUCING IN THEIR HUSBANDS THAT DEPLORABLE INDIFFERENCE WHICH DOES SO MUCH TO PROMOTE THE WOMAN MOVEMENT ‚Ä¶ THAT IS, IF I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY.‚Ä¶ H‚ÄÔM! IT‚ÄÔS A FINE HALL; THE ROOMS ARE NOT BADLY DECORATED. IT MIGHT BE WORSE. THE MUSIC MIGHT BE MUCH WORSE.‚Ä¶ I DON‚ÄÔT SAY IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN. WHAT MAKES A BAD IMPRESSION IS THAT THERE ARE SO FEW LADIES. I SAY NOTHING ABOUT THE DRESSES. IT‚ÄÔS BAD THAT THAT CHAP IN THE GREY TROUSERS SHOULD DARE TO DANCE THE CANCAN SO OPENLY. I CAN FORGIVE HIM IF HE DOES IT IN THE GAIETY OF HIS HEART, AND SINCE HE IS THE LOCAL CHEMIST.‚Ä¶ STILL, ELEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK IS A BIT EARLY EVEN FOR CHEMISTS. THERE WERE TWO FELLOWS FIGHTING IN THE REFRESHMENT-BAR AND THEY WEREN‚ÄÔT TURNED OUT. AT ELEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE TURNED OUT FOR FIGHTING, WHATEVER THE STANDARD OF MANNERS.‚Ä¶ THREE O‚ÄÔCLOCK IS A DIFFERENT MATTER; THEN ONE HAS TO MAKE CONCESSIONS TO PUBLIC OPINION‚ÄÎIF ONLY THIS BALL SURVIVES TILL THREE O‚ÄÔCLOCK. VARVARA PETROVNA HAS NOT KEPT HER WORD, THOUGH, AND HASN‚ÄÔT SENT FLOWERS. H‚ÄÔM! SHE HAS NO THOUGHTS FOR FLOWERS, PAUVRE M√®RE! AND POOR LIZA! HAVE YOU HEARD? THEY SAY IT‚ÄÔS A MYSTERIOUS STORY ‚Ä¶ AND STAVROGIN IS TO THE FRONT AGAIN.‚Ä¶ H‚ÄÔM! I WOULD HAVE GONE HOME TO BED ‚Ä¶ I CAN HARDLY KEEP MY EYES OPEN. BUT WHEN IS THIS ‚ÄÒLITERARY QUADRILLE‚ÄÔ COMING ON?‚ÄÙ

AT LAST THE ‚ÄÚLITERARY QUADRILLE‚ÄÙ BEGAN. WHENEVER OF LATE THERE HAD BEEN CONVERSATION IN THE TOWN ON THE BALL IT HAD INVARIABLY TURNED ON THIS LITERARY QUADRILLE, AND AS NO ONE COULD IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE, IT AROUSED EXTRAORDINARY CURIOSITY. NOTHING COULD BE MORE UNFAVOURABLE TO ITS CHANCE OF SUCCESS, AND GREAT WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT.

THE SIDE DOORS OF THE WHITE HALL WERE THROWN OPEN AND SEVERAL MASKED FIGURES APPEARED. THE PUBLIC SURROUNDED THEM EAGERLY. ALL THE OCCUPANTS OF THE REFRESHMENT-BAR TROOPED TO THE LAST MAN INTO THE HALL. THE MASKED FIGURES TOOK THEIR PLACES FOR THE DANCE. I SUCCEEDED IN MAKING MY WAY TO THE FRONT AND INSTALLED MYSELF JUST BEHIND YULIA MIHAILOVNA, VON LEMBKE, AND THE GENERAL. AT THIS POINT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WHO HAD KEPT AWAY TILL THAT TIME, SKIPPED UP TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE BEEN IN THE REFRESHMENT-ROOM ALL THIS TIME, WATCHING,‚ÄÙ HE WHISPERED, WITH THE AIR OF A GUILTY SCHOOLBOY, WHICH HE, HOWEVER, ASSUMED ON PURPOSE TO IRRITATE HER EVEN MORE. SHE TURNED CRIMSON WITH ANGER.

‚ÄÚYOU MIGHT GIVE UP TRYING TO DECEIVE ME NOW AT LEAST, INSOLENT MAN!‚ÄÙ BROKE FROM HER ALMOST ALOUD, SO THAT IT WAS HEARD BY OTHER PEOPLE. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SKIPPED AWAY EXTREMELY WELL SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF.

IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE A MORE PITIFUL, VULGAR, DULL AND INSIPID ALLEGORY THAN THIS ‚ÄÚLITERARY QUADRILLE.‚ÄÙ NOTHING COULD BE IMAGINED LESS APPROPRIATE TO OUR LOCAL SOCIETY. YET THEY SAY IT WAS KARMAZINOV‚ÄÔS IDEA. IT WAS LIPUTIN INDEED WHO ARRANGED IT WITH THE HELP OF THE LAME TEACHER WHO HAD BEEN AT THE MEETING AT VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS. BUT KARMAZINOV HAD GIVEN THE IDEA AND HAD, IT WAS SAID, MEANT TO DRESS UP AND TO TAKE A SPECIAL AND PROMINENT PART IN IT. THE QUADRILLE WAS MADE UP OF SIX COUPLES OF MASKED FIGURES, WHO WERE NOT IN FANCY DRESS EXACTLY, FOR THEIR CLOTHES WERE LIKE EVERY ONE ELSE‚ÄÔS. THUS, FOR INSTANCE, ONE SHORT AND ELDERLY GENTLEMAN WEARING A DRESS-COAT‚ÄÎIN FACT, DRESSED LIKE EVERY ONE ELSE‚ÄÎWORE A VENERABLE GREY BEARD, TIED ON (AND THIS CONSTITUTED HIS DISGUISE). AS HE DANCED HE POUNDED UP AND DOWN, TAKING TINY AND RAPID STEPS ON THE SAME SPOT WITH A STOLID EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE. HE GAVE VENT TO SOUNDS IN A SUBDUED BUT HUSKY BASS, AND THIS HUSKINESS WAS MEANT TO SUGGEST ONE OF THE WELL-KNOWN PAPERS. OPPOSITE THIS FIGURE DANCED TWO GIANTS, X AND Z, AND THESE LETTERS WERE PINNED ON THEIR COATS, BUT WHAT THE LETTERS MEANT REMAINED UNEXPLAINED. ‚ÄÚHONEST RUSSIAN THOUGHT‚ÄÙ WAS REPRESENTED BY A MIDDLE-AGED GENTLEMAN IN SPECTACLES, DRESS-COAT AND GLOVES, AND WEARING FETTERS (REAL FETTERS). UNDER HIS ARM HE HAD A PORTFOLIO CONTAINING PAPERS RELATING TO SOME ‚ÄÚCASE.‚ÄÙ TO CONVINCE THE SCEPTICAL, A LETTER FROM ABROAD TESTIFYING TO THE HONESTY OF ‚ÄÚHONEST RUSSIAN THOUGHT‚ÄÙ PEEPED OUT OF HIS POCKET. ALL THIS WAS EXPLAINED BY THE STEWARDS, AS THE LETTER WHICH PEEPED OUT OF HIS POCKET COULD NOT BE READ. ‚ÄÚHONEST RUSSIAN THOUGHT‚ÄÙ HAD HIS RIGHT HAND RAISED AND IN IT HELD A GLASS AS THOUGH HE WANTED TO PROPOSE A TOAST. IN A LINE WITH HIM ON EACH SIDE TRIPPED A CROP-HEADED NIHILIST GIRL; WHILE VIS-√†-VIS DANCED ANOTHER ELDERLY GENTLEMAN IN A DRESS-COAT WITH A HEAVY CUDGEL IN HIS HAND. HE WAS MEANT TO REPRESENT A FORMIDABLE PERIODICAL (NOT A PETERSBURG ONE), AND SEEMED TO BE SAYING, ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL POUND YOU TO A JELLY.‚ÄÙ BUT IN SPITE OF HIS CUDGEL HE COULD NOT BEAR THE SPECTACLES OF ‚ÄÚHONEST RUSSIAN THOUGHT‚ÄÙ FIXED UPON HIM AND TRIED TO LOOK AWAY, AND WHEN HE DID THE PAS DE DEUX, HE TWISTED, TURNED, AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIMSELF‚ÄÎSO TERRIBLE, PROBABLY, WERE THE STINGS OF HIS CONSCIENCE! I DON‚ÄÔT REMEMBER ALL THE ABSURD TRICKS THEY PLAYED, HOWEVER; IT WAS ALL IN THE SAME STYLE, SO THAT I FELT AT LAST PAINFULLY ASHAMED. AND THIS SAME EXPRESSION, AS IT WERE, OF SHAME WAS REFLECTED IN THE WHOLE PUBLIC, EVEN ON THE MOST SULLEN FIGURES THAT HAD COME OUT OF THE REFRESHMENT-ROOM. FOR SOME TIME ALL WERE SILENT AND GAZED WITH ANGRY PERPLEXITY. WHEN A MAN IS ASHAMED HE GENERALLY BEGINS TO GET ANGRY AND IS DISPOSED TO BE CYNICAL. BY DEGREES A MURMUR AROSE IN THE AUDIENCE.

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THE MEANING OF IT?‚ÄÙ A MAN WHO HAD COME IN FROM THE REFRESHMENT-ROOM MUTTERED IN ONE OF THE GROUPS.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS SILLY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS SOMETHING LITERARY. IT‚ÄÔS A CRITICISM OF THE VOICE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THAT TO ME?‚ÄÙ

FROM ANOTHER GROUP:

‚ÄÚASSES!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, THEY ARE NOT ASSES; IT‚ÄÔS WE WHO ARE THE ASSES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY ARE YOU AN ASS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM NOT AN ASS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, IF YOU ARE NOT, I AM CERTAINLY NOT.‚ÄÙ

FROM A THIRD GROUP:

‚ÄÚWE OUGHT TO GIVE THEM A GOOD SMACKING AND SEND THEM FLYING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPULL DOWN THE HALL!‚ÄÙ

FROM A FOURTH GROUP:

‚ÄÚI WONDER THE LEMBKES ARE NOT ASHAMED TO LOOK ON!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY SHOULD THEY BE ASHAMED? YOU ARE NOT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, I AM ASHAMED, AND HE IS THE GOVERNOR.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND YOU ARE A PIG.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A COMMONPLACE BALL IN MY LIFE,‚ÄÙ A LADY OBSERVED VICIOUSLY, QUITE CLOSE TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA, OBVIOUSLY WITH THE INTENTION OF BEING OVERHEARD. SHE WAS A STOUT LADY OF FORTY WITH ROUGE ON HER CHEEKS, WEARING A BRIGHT-COLOURED SILK DRESS. ALMOST EVERY ONE IN THE TOWN KNEW HER, BUT NO ONE RECEIVED HER. SHE WAS THE WIDOW OF A CIVIL COUNCILLOR, WHO HAD LEFT HER A WOODEN HOUSE AND A SMALL PENSION; BUT SHE LIVED WELL AND KEPT HORSES. TWO MONTHS PREVIOUSLY SHE HAD CALLED ON YULIA MIHAILOVNA, BUT THE LATTER HAD NOT RECEIVED HER.

‚ÄÚTHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FORESEEN,‚ÄÙ SHE ADDED, LOOKING INSOLENTLY INTO YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS FACE.

‚ÄÚIF YOU COULD FORESEE IT, WHY DID YOU COME?‚ÄÙ YULIA MIHAILOVNA COULD NOT RESIST SAYING.

‚ÄÚBECAUSE I WAS TOO SIMPLE,‚ÄÙ THE SPRIGHTLY LADY ANSWERED INSTANTLY, UP IN ARMS AND EAGER FOR THE FRAY; BUT THE GENERAL INTERVENED.

‚ÄÚCH√®RE DAME‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHE BENT OVER TO YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔD REALLY BETTER BE GOING. WE ARE ONLY IN THEIR WAY AND THEY‚ÄÔLL ENJOY THEMSELVES THOROUGHLY WITHOUT US. YOU‚ÄÔVE DONE YOUR PART, YOU‚ÄÔVE OPENED THE BALL, NOW LEAVE THEM IN PEACE. AND ANDREY ANTONOVITCH DOESN‚ÄÔT SEEM TO BE FEELING QUITE SATISFACTORILY.‚Ä¶ TO AVOID TROUBLE.‚ÄÙ

BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.

ALL THROUGH THE QUADRILLE ANDREY ANTONOVITCH GAZED AT THE DANCERS WITH A SORT OF ANGRY PERPLEXITY, AND WHEN HE HEARD THE COMMENTS OF THE AUDIENCE HE BEGAN LOOKING ABOUT HIM UNEASILY. THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOME OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD COME FROM THE REFRESHMENT-ROOM; THERE WAS AN EXPRESSION OF EXTREME WONDER IN HIS FACE. SUDDENLY THERE WAS A LOUD ROAR OF LAUGHTER AT A CAPER THAT WAS CUT IN THE QUADRILLE. THE EDITOR OF THE ‚ÄÚMENACING PERIODICAL, NOT A PETERSBURG ONE,‚ÄÙ WHO WAS DANCING WITH THE CUDGEL IN HIS HANDS, FELT UTTERLY UNABLE TO ENDURE THE SPECTACLED GAZE OF ‚ÄÚHONEST RUSSIAN THOUGHT,‚ÄÙ AND NOT KNOWING HOW TO ESCAPE IT, SUDDENLY IN THE LAST FIGURE ADVANCED TO MEET HIM STANDING ON HIS HEAD, WHICH WAS MEANT, BY THE WAY, TO TYPIFY THE CONTINUAL TURNING UPSIDE DOWN OF COMMON SENSE BY THE MENACING NON-PETERSBURG GAZETTE. AS LYAMSHIN WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD WALK STANDING ON HIS HEAD, HE HAD UNDERTAKEN TO REPRESENT THE EDITOR WITH THE CUDGEL. YULIA MIHAILOVNA HAD HAD NO IDEA THAT ANYONE WAS GOING TO WALK ON HIS HEAD. ‚ÄÚTHEY CONCEALED THAT FROM ME, THEY CONCEALED IT,‚ÄÙ SHE REPEATED TO ME AFTERWARDS IN DESPAIR AND INDIGNATION. THE LAUGHTER FROM THE CROWD WAS, OF COURSE, PROVOKED NOT BY THE ALLEGORY, WHICH INTERESTED NO ONE, BUT SIMPLY BY A MAN‚ÄÔS WALKING ON HIS HEAD IN A SWALLOW-TAIL COAT. LEMBKE FLEW INTO A RAGE AND SHOOK WITH FURY.

‚ÄÚRASCAL!‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, POINTING TO LYAMSHIN, ‚ÄÚTAKE HOLD OF THE SCOUNDREL, TURN HIM OVER ‚Ä¶ TURN HIS LEGS ‚Ä¶ HIS HEAD ‚Ä¶ SO THAT HIS HEAD‚ÄÔS UP ‚Ä¶ UP!‚ÄÙ

LYAMSHIN JUMPED ON TO HIS FEET. THE LAUGHTER GREW LOUDER.

‚ÄÚTURN OUT ALL THE SCOUNDRELS WHO ARE LAUGHING!‚ÄÙ LEMBKE PRESCRIBED SUDDENLY.

THERE WAS AN ANGRY ROAR AND LAUGHTER IN THE CROWD.

‚ÄÚYOU CAN‚ÄÔT DO LIKE THAT, YOUR EXCELLENCY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU MUSTN‚ÄÔT ABUSE THE PUBLIC.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE A FOOL YOURSELF!‚ÄÙ A VOICE CRIED SUDDENLY FROM A CORNER.

‚ÄÚFILIBUSTERS!‚ÄÙ SHOUTED SOMEONE FROM THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM.

LEMBKE LOOKED ROUND QUICKLY AT THE SHOUT AND TURNED PALE. A VACANT SMILE CAME ON TO HIS LIPS, AS THOUGH HE SUDDENLY UNDERSTOOD AND REMEMBERED SOMETHING.

‚ÄÚGENTLEMEN,‚ÄÙ SAID YULIA MIHAILOVNA, ADDRESSING THE CROWD WHICH WAS PRESSING ROUND THEM, AS SHE DREW HER HUSBAND AWAY‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚGENTLEMEN, EXCUSE ANDREY ANTONOVITCH. ANDREY ANTONOVITCH IS UNWELL ‚Ä¶ EXCUSE ‚Ä¶ FORGIVE HIM, GENTLEMEN.‚ÄÙ

I POSITIVELY HEARD HER SAY ‚ÄÚFORGIVE HIM.‚ÄÙ IT ALL HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY. BUT I REMEMBER FOR A FACT THAT A SECTION OF THE PUBLIC RUSHED OUT OF THE HALL IMMEDIATELY AFTER THOSE WORDS OF YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS AS THOUGH PANIC-STRICKEN. I REMEMBER ONE HYSTERICAL, TEARFUL FEMININE SHRIEK:

‚ÄÚACH, THE SAME THING AGAIN!‚ÄÙ

AND IN THE RETREAT OF THE GUESTS, WHICH WAS ALMOST BECOMING A CRUSH, ANOTHER BOMB EXPLODED EXACTLY AS IN THE AFTERNOON.

‚ÄÚFIRE! ALL THE RIVERSIDE QUARTER IS ON FIRE!‚ÄÙ

I DON‚ÄÔT REMEMBER WHERE THIS TERRIBLE CRY ROSE FIRST, WHETHER IT WAS FIRST RAISED IN THE HALL, OR WHETHER SOMEONE RAN UPSTAIRS FROM THE ENTRY, BUT IT WAS FOLLOWED BY SUCH ALARM THAT I CAN‚ÄÔT ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE IT. MORE THAN HALF THE GUESTS AT THE BALL CAME FROM THE QUARTER BEYOND THE RIVER, AND WERE OWNERS OR OCCUPIERS OF WOODEN HOUSES IN THAT DISTRICT. THEY RUSHED TO THE WINDOWS, PULLED BACK THE CURTAINS IN A FLASH, AND TORE DOWN THE BLINDS. THE RIVERSIDE WAS IN FLAMES. THE FIRE, IT IS TRUE, WAS ONLY BEGINNING, BUT IT WAS IN FLAMES IN THREE SEPARATE PLACES‚ÄÎAND THAT WAS WHAT WAS ALARMING.

‚ÄÚARSON! THE SHPIGULIN MEN!‚ÄÙ ROARED THE CROWD.

I REMEMBER SOME VERY CHARACTERISTIC EXCLAMATIONS:

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE HAD A PRESENTIMENT IN MY HEART THAT THERE‚ÄÔD BE ARSON, I‚ÄÔVE HAD A PRESENTIMENT OF IT THESE LAST FEW DAYS!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE SHPIGULIN MEN, THE SHPIGULIN MEN, NO ONE ELSE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWE WERE ALL LURED HERE ON PURPOSE TO SET FIRE TO IT!‚ÄÙ

THIS LAST MOST AMAZING EXCLAMATION CAME FROM A WOMAN; IT WAS AN UNINTENTIONAL INVOLUNTARY SHRIEK OF A HOUSEWIFE WHOSE GOODS WERE BURNING. EVERY ONE RUSHED FOR THE DOOR. I WON‚ÄÔT DESCRIBE THE CRUSH IN THE VESTIBULE OVER SORTING OUT CLOAKS, SHAWLS, AND PELISSES, THE SHRIEKS OF THE FRIGHTENED WOMEN, THE WEEPING OF THE YOUNG LADIES. I DOUBT WHETHER THERE WAS ANY THEFT, BUT IT WAS NO WONDER THAT IN SUCH DISORDER SOME WENT AWAY WITHOUT THEIR WRAPS BECAUSE THEY WERE UNABLE TO FIND THEM, AND THIS GREW INTO A LEGEND WITH MANY ADDITIONS, LONG PRESERVED IN THE TOWN. LEMBKE AND YULIA MIHAILOVNA WERE ALMOST CRUSHED BY THE CROWD AT THE DOORS.

‚ÄÚSTOP, EVERY ONE! DON‚ÄÔT LET ANYONE OUT!‚ÄÙ YELLED LEMBKE, STRETCHING OUT HIS ARMS MENACINGLY TOWARDS THE CROWDING PEOPLE.

‚ÄÚEVERY ONE WITHOUT EXCEPTION TO BE STRICTLY SEARCHED AT ONCE!‚ÄÙ

A STORM OF VIOLENT OATHS ROSE FROM THE CROWD.

‚ÄÚANDREY ANTONOVITCH! ANDREY ANTONOVITCH!‚ÄÙ CRIED YULIA MIHAILOVNA IN COMPLETE DESPAIR.

‚ÄÚARREST HER FIRST!‚ÄÙ SHOUTED HER HUSBAND, POINTING HIS FINGER AT HER THREATENINGLY. ‚ÄÚSEARCH HER FIRST! THE BALL WAS ARRANGED WITH A VIEW TO THE FIRE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

SHE SCREAMED AND FELL INTO A SWOON. (OH, THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF ITS BEING A REAL ONE.) THE GENERAL, THE PRINCE, AND I RUSHED TO HER ASSISTANCE; THERE WERE OTHERS, EVEN AMONG THE LADIES, WHO HELPED US AT THAT DIFFICULT MOMENT. WE CARRIED THE UNHAPPY WOMAN OUT OF THIS HELL TO HER CARRIAGE, BUT SHE ONLY REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS AS SHE REACHED THE HOUSE, AND HER FIRST UTTERANCE WAS ABOUT ANDREY ANTONOVITCH AGAIN. WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL HER FANCIES, THE ONLY THING LEFT IN HER MIND WAS ANDREY ANTONOVITCH. THEY SENT FOR A DOCTOR. I REMAINED WITH HER FOR A WHOLE HOUR; THE PRINCE DID SO TOO. THE GENERAL, IN AN ACCESS OF GENEROUS FEELING (THOUGH HE HAD BEEN TERRIBLY SCARED), MEANT TO REMAIN ALL NIGHT ‚ÄÚBY THE BEDSIDE OF THE UNHAPPY LADY,‚ÄÙ BUT WITHIN TEN MINUTES HE FELL ASLEEP IN AN ARM-CHAIR IN THE DRAWING-ROOM WHILE WAITING FOR THE DOCTOR, AND THERE WE LEFT HIM.

THE CHIEF OF THE POLICE, WHO HAD HURRIED FROM THE BALL TO THE FIRE, HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING ANDREY ANTONOVITCH OUT OF THE HALL AFTER US, AND ATTEMPTED TO PUT HIM INTO YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS CARRIAGE, TRYING ALL HE COULD TO PERSUADE HIS EXCELLENCY ‚ÄÚTO SEEK REPOSE.‚ÄÙ BUT I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHY HE DID NOT INSIST. ANDREY ANTONOVITCH, OF COURSE, WOULD NOT HEAR OF REPOSE, AND WAS SET ON GOING TO THE FIRE; BUT THAT WAS NOT A SUFFICIENT REASON. IT ENDED IN HIS TAKING HIM TO THE FIRE IN HIS DROSHKY. HE TOLD US AFTERWARDS THAT LEMBKE WAS GESTICULATING ALL THE WAY AND ‚ÄÚSHOUTING ORDERS THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO OBEY OWING TO THEIR UNUSUALNESS.‚ÄÙ IT WAS OFFICIALLY REPORTED LATER ON THAT HIS EXCELLENCY HAD AT THAT TIME BEEN IN A DELIRIOUS CONDITION ‚ÄÚOWING TO A SUDDEN FRIGHT.‚ÄÙ

THERE IS NO NEED TO DESCRIBE HOW THE BALL ENDED. A FEW DOZEN ROWDY FELLOWS, AND WITH THEM SOME LADIES, REMAINED IN THE HALL. THERE WERE NO POLICE PRESENT. THEY WOULD NOT LET THE ORCHESTRA GO, AND BEAT THE MUSICIANS WHO ATTEMPTED TO LEAVE. BY MORNING THEY HAD PULLED ALL PROHORITCH‚ÄÔS STALL TO PIECES, HAD DRUNK THEMSELVES SENSELESS, DANCED THE KAMARINSKY IN ITS UNEXPURGATED FORM, MADE THE ROOMS IN A SHOCKING MESS, AND ONLY TOWARDS DAYBREAK PART OF THIS HOPELESSLY DRUNKEN RABBLE REACHED THE SCENE OF THE FIRE TO MAKE FRESH DISTURBANCES THERE. THE OTHER PART SPENT THE NIGHT IN THE ROOMS DEAD DRUNK, WITH DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES TO THE VELVET SOFAS AND THE FLOOR. NEXT MORNING, AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBILITY, THEY WERE DRAGGED OUT BY THEIR LEGS INTO THE STREET. SO ENDED THE F√™TE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE GOVERNESSES OF OUR PROVINCE.

IV

THE FIRE FRIGHTENED THE INHABITANTS OF THE RIVERSIDE JUST BECAUSE IT WAS EVIDENTLY A CASE OF ARSON. IT WAS CURIOUS THAT AT THE FIRST CRY OF ‚ÄÚFIRE‚ÄÙ ANOTHER CRY WAS RAISED THAT THE SHPIGULIN MEN HAD DONE IT. IT IS NOW WELL KNOWN THAT THREE SHPIGULIN MEN REALLY DID HAVE A SHARE IN SETTING FIRE TO THE TOWN, BUT THAT WAS ALL; ALL THE OTHER FACTORY HANDS WERE COMPLETELY ACQUITTED, NOT ONLY OFFICIALLY BUT ALSO BY PUBLIC OPINION. BESIDES THOSE THREE RASCALS (OF WHOM ONE HAS BEEN CAUGHT AND CONFESSED AND THE OTHER TWO HAVE SO FAR ESCAPED), FEDKA THE CONVICT UNDOUBTEDLY HAD A HAND IN THE ARSON. THAT IS ALL THAT IS KNOWN FOR CERTAIN ABOUT THE FIRE TILL NOW; BUT WHEN IT COMES TO CONJECTURES IT‚ÄÔS A VERY DIFFERENT MATTER. WHAT HAD LED THESE THREE RASCALS TO DO IT? HAD THEY BEEN INSTIGATED BY ANYONE? IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ANSWER ALL THESE QUESTIONS EVEN NOW.

OWING TO THE STRONG WIND, THE FACT THAT THE HOUSES AT THE RIVERSIDE WERE ALMOST ALL WOODEN, AND THAT THEY HAD BEEN SET FIRE TO IN THREE PLACES, THE FIRE SPREAD QUICKLY AND ENVELOPED THE WHOLE QUARTER WITH EXTRAORDINARY RAPIDITY. (THE FIRE BURNT, HOWEVER, ONLY AT TWO ENDS; AT THE THIRD SPOT IT WAS EXTINGUISHED ALMOST AS SOON AS IT BEGAN TO BURN‚ÄÎOF WHICH LATER.) BUT THE PETERSBURG AND MOSCOW PAPERS EXAGGERATED OUR CALAMITY. NOT MORE THAN A QUARTER, ROUGHLY SPEAKING, OF THE RIVERSIDE DISTRICT WAS BURNT DOWN; POSSIBLY LESS INDEED. OUR FIRE BRIGADE, THOUGH IT WAS HARDLY ADEQUATE TO THE SIZE AND POPULATION OF THE TOWN, WORKED WITH GREAT PROMPTITUDE AND DEVOTION. BUT IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN OF MUCH AVAIL, EVEN WITH THE ZEALOUS CO-OPERATION OF THE INHABITANTS, IF THE WIND HAD NOT SUDDENLY DROPPED TOWARDS MORNING. WHEN AN HOUR AFTER OUR FLIGHT FROM THE BALL I MADE MY WAY TO THE RIVERSIDE, THE FIRE WAS AT ITS HEIGHT. A WHOLE STREET PARALLEL WITH THE RIVER WAS IN FLAMES. IT WAS AS LIGHT AS DAY. I WON‚ÄÔT DESCRIBE THE FIRE; EVERY ONE IN RUSSIA KNOWS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. THE BUSTLE AND CRUSH WAS IMMENSE IN THE LANES ADJOINING THE BURNING STREET. THE INHABITANTS, FULLY EXPECTING THE FIRE TO REACH THEIR HOUSES, WERE HAULING OUT THEIR BELONGINGS, BUT HAD NOT YET LEFT THEIR DWELLINGS, AND WERE WAITING MEANWHILE SITTING ON THEIR BOXES AND FEATHER BEDS UNDER THEIR WINDOWS. PART OF THE MALE POPULATION WERE HARD AT WORK RUTHLESSLY CHOPPING DOWN FENCES AND EVEN WHOLE HUTS WHICH WERE NEAR THE FIRE AND ON THE WINDWARD SIDE. NONE WERE CRYING EXCEPT THE CHILDREN, WHO HAD BEEN WAKED OUT OF THEIR SLEEP, THOUGH THE WOMEN WHO HAD DRAGGED OUT THEIR CHATTELS WERE LAMENTING IN SING-SONG VOICES. THOSE WHO HAD NOT FINISHED THEIR TASK WERE STILL SILENT, BUSILY CARRYING OUT THEIR GOODS. SPARKS AND EMBERS WERE CARRIED A LONG WAY IN ALL DIRECTIONS. PEOPLE PUT THEM OUT AS BEST THEY COULD. SOME HELPED TO PUT THE FIRE OUT WHILE OTHERS STOOD ABOUT, ADMIRING IT. A GREAT FIRE AT NIGHT ALWAYS HAS A THRILLING AND EXHILARATING EFFECT. THIS IS WHAT EXPLAINS THE ATTRACTION OF FIREWORKS. BUT IN THAT CASE THE ARTISTIC REGULARITY WITH WHICH THE FIRE IS PRESENTED AND THE COMPLETE LACK OF DANGER GIVE AN IMPRESSION OF LIGHTNESS AND PLAYFULNESS LIKE THE EFFECT OF A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE. A REAL CONFLAGRATION IS A VERY DIFFERENT MATTER. THEN THE HORROR AND A CERTAIN SENSE OF PERSONAL DANGER, TOGETHER WITH THE EXHILARATING EFFECT OF A FIRE AT NIGHT, PRODUCE ON THE SPECTATOR (THOUGH OF COURSE NOT IN THE HOUSEHOLDER WHOSE GOODS ARE BEING BURNT) A CERTAIN CONCUSSION OF THE BRAIN AND, AS IT WERE, A CHALLENGE TO THOSE DESTRUCTIVE INSTINCTS WHICH, ALAS, LIE HIDDEN IN EVERY HEART, EVEN THAT OF THE MILDEST AND MOST DOMESTIC LITTLE CLERK.‚Ä¶ THIS SINISTER SENSATION IS ALMOST ALWAYS FASCINATING. ‚ÄÚI REALLY DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHETHER ONE CAN LOOK AT A FIRE WITHOUT A CERTAIN PLEASURE.‚ÄÙ THIS IS WORD FOR WORD WHAT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SAID TO ME ONE NIGHT ON RETURNING HOME AFTER HE HAD HAPPENED TO WITNESS A FIRE AND WAS STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE SPECTACLE. OF COURSE, THE VERY MAN WHO ENJOYS THE SPECTACLE WILL RUSH INTO THE FIRE HIMSELF TO SAVE A CHILD OR AN OLD WOMAN; BUT THAT IS ALTOGETHER A DIFFERENT MATTER.

FOLLOWING IN THE WAKE OF THE CROWD OF SIGHTSEERS, I SUCCEEDED, WITHOUT ASKING QUESTIONS, IN REACHING THE CHIEF CENTRE OF DANGER, WHERE AT LAST I SAW LEMBKE, WHOM I WAS SEEKING AT YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS REQUEST. HIS POSITION WAS STRANGE AND EXTRAORDINARY. HE WAS STANDING ON THE RUINS OF A FENCE. THIRTY PACES TO THE LEFT OF HIM ROSE THE BLACK SKELETON OF A TWO-STORIED HOUSE WHICH HAD ALMOST BURNT OUT. IT HAD HOLES INSTEAD OF WINDOWS AT EACH STORY, ITS ROOF HAD FALLEN IN, AND THE FLAMES WERE STILL HERE AND THERE CREEPING AMONG THE CHARRED BEAMS. AT THE FARTHER END OF THE COURTYARD, TWENTY PACES AWAY, THE LODGE, ALSO A TWO-STORIED BUILDING, WAS BEGINNING TO BURN, AND THE FIREMEN WERE DOING THEIR UTMOST TO SAVE IT. ON THE RIGHT THE FIREMEN AND THE PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO SAVE A RATHER LARGE WOODEN BUILDING WHICH WAS NOT ACTUALLY BURNING, THOUGH IT HAD CAUGHT FIRE SEVERAL TIMES AND WAS INEVITABLY BOUND TO BE BURNT IN THE END. LEMBKE STOOD FACING THE LODGE, SHOUTING AND GESTICULATING. HE WAS GIVING ORDERS WHICH NO ONE ATTEMPTED TO CARRY OUT. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT EVERY ONE HAD GIVEN HIM UP AS HOPELESS AND LEFT HIM. ANYWAY, THOUGH EVERY ONE IN THE VAST CROWD OF ALL CLASSES, AMONG WHOM THERE WERE GENTLEMEN, AND EVEN THE CATHEDRAL PRIEST, WAS LISTENING TO HIM WITH CURIOSITY AND WONDER, NO ONE SPOKE TO HIM OR TRIED TO GET HIM AWAY. LEMBKE, WITH A PALE FACE AND GLITTERING EYES, WAS UTTERING THE MOST AMAZING THINGS. TO COMPLETE THE PICTURE, HE HAD LOST HIS HAT AND WAS BAREHEADED.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS ALL INCENDIARISM! IT‚ÄÔS NIHILISM! IF ANYTHING IS BURNING, IT‚ÄÔS NIHILISM!‚ÄÙ I HEARD ALMOST WITH HORROR; AND THOUGH THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SURPRISED AT, YET ACTUAL MADNESS, WHEN ONE SEES IT, ALWAYS GIVES ONE A SHOCK.

‚ÄÚYOUR EXCELLENCY,‚ÄÙ SAID A POLICEMAN, COMING UP TO HIM, ‚ÄÚWHAT IF YOU WERE TO TRY THE REPOSE OF HOME?‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS DANGEROUS FOR YOUR EXCELLENCY EVEN TO STAND HERE.‚ÄÙ

THIS POLICEMAN, AS I HEARD AFTERWARDS, HAD BEEN TOLD OFF BY THE CHIEF OF POLICE TO WATCH OVER ANDREY ANTONOVITCH, TO DO HIS UTMOST TO GET HIM HOME, AND IN CASE OF DANGER EVEN TO USE FORCE‚ÄÎA TASK EVIDENTLY BEYOND THE MAN‚ÄÔS POWER.

‚ÄÚTHEY WILL WIPE AWAY THE TEARS OF THE PEOPLE WHOSE HOUSES HAVE BEEN BURNT, BUT THEY WILL BURN DOWN THE TOWN. IT‚ÄÔS ALL THE WORK OF FOUR SCOUNDRELS, FOUR AND A HALF! ARREST THE SCOUNDREL! HE WORMS HIMSELF INTO THE HONOUR OF FAMILIES. THEY MADE USE OF THE GOVERNESSES TO BURN DOWN THE HOUSES. IT‚ÄÔS VILE, VILE! AIE, WHAT‚ÄÔS HE ABOUT?‚ÄÙ HE SHOUTED, SUDDENLY NOTICING A FIREMAN AT THE TOP OF THE BURNING LODGE, UNDER WHOM THE ROOF HAD ALMOST BURNT AWAY AND ROUND WHOM THE FLAMES WERE BEGINNING TO FLARE UP. ‚ÄÚPULL HIM DOWN! PULL HIM DOWN! HE WILL FALL, HE WILL CATCH FIRE, PUT HIM OUT!‚Ä¶ WHAT IS HE DOING THERE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE IS PUTTING THE FIRE OUT, YOUR EXCELLENCY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOT LIKELY. THE FIRE IS IN THE MINDS OF MEN AND NOT IN THE ROOFS OF HOUSES. PULL HIM DOWN AND GIVE IT UP! BETTER GIVE IT UP, MUCH BETTER! LET IT PUT ITSELF OUT. AIE, WHO IS CRYING NOW? AN OLD WOMAN! IT‚ÄÔS AN OLD WOMAN SHOUTING. WHY HAVE THEY FORGOTTEN THE OLD WOMAN?‚ÄÙ

THERE ACTUALLY WAS AN OLD WOMAN CRYING ON THE GROUND FLOOR OF THE BURNING LODGE. SHE WAS AN OLD CREATURE OF EIGHTY, A RELATION OF THE SHOPKEEPER WHO OWNED THE HOUSE. BUT SHE HAD NOT BEEN FORGOTTEN; SHE HAD GONE BACK TO THE BURNING HOUSE WHILE IT WAS STILL POSSIBLE, WITH THE INSANE IDEA OF RESCUING HER FEATHER BED FROM A CORNER ROOM WHICH WAS STILL UNTOUCHED. CHOKING WITH THE SMOKE AND SCREAMING WITH THE HEAT, FOR THE ROOM WAS ON FIRE BY THE TIME SHE REACHED IT, SHE WAS STILL TRYING WITH HER DECREPIT HANDS TO SQUEEZE HER FEATHER BED THROUGH A BROKEN WINDOW PANE. LEMBKE RUSHED TO HER ASSISTANCE. EVERY ONE SAW HIM RUN UP TO THE WINDOW, CATCH HOLD OF ONE CORNER OF THE FEATHER BED AND TRY WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO PULL IT OUT. AS ILL LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, A BOARD FELL AT THAT MOMENT FROM THE ROOF AND HIT THE UNHAPPY GOVERNOR. IT DID NOT KILL HIM, IT MERELY GRAZED HIM ON THE NECK AS IT FELL, BUT ANDREY ANTONOVITCH‚ÄÔS CAREER WAS OVER, AMONG US AT LEAST; THE BLOW KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET AND HE SANK ON THE GROUND UNCONSCIOUS.

THE DAY DAWNED AT LAST, GLOOMY AND SULLEN. THE FIRE WAS ABATING; THE WIND WAS FOLLOWED BY A SUDDEN CALM, AND THEN A FINE DRIZZLING RAIN FELL. I WAS BY THAT TIME IN ANOTHER PART, SOME DISTANCE FROM WHERE LEMBKE HAD FALLEN, AND HERE I OVERHEARD VERY STRANGE CONVERSATIONS IN THE CROWD. A STRANGE FACT HAD COME TO LIGHT. ON THE VERY OUTSKIRTS OF THE QUARTER, ON A PIECE OF WASTE LAND BEYOND THE KITCHEN GARDENS, NOT LESS THAN FIFTY PACES FROM ANY OTHER BUILDINGS, THERE STOOD A LITTLE WOODEN HOUSE WHICH HAD ONLY LATELY BEEN BUILT, AND THIS SOLITARY HOUSE HAD BEEN ON FIRE AT THE VERY BEGINNING, ALMOST BEFORE ANY OTHER. EVEN HAD IT BURNT DOWN, IT WAS SO FAR FROM OTHER HOUSES THAT NO OTHER BUILDING IN THE TOWN COULD HAVE CAUGHT FIRE FROM IT, AND, VICE VERSA, IF THE WHOLE RIVERSIDE HAD BEEN BURNT TO THE GROUND, THAT HOUSE MIGHT HAVE REMAINED INTACT, WHATEVER THE WIND HAD BEEN. IT FOLLOWED THAT IT HAD CAUGHT FIRE SEPARATELY AND INDEPENDENTLY AND THEREFORE NOT ACCIDENTALLY. BUT THE CHIEF POINT WAS THAT IT WAS NOT BURNT TO THE GROUND, AND AT DAYBREAK STRANGE THINGS WERE DISCOVERED WITHIN IT. THE OWNER OF THIS NEW HOUSE, WHO LIVED IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, RUSHED UP AS SOON AS HE SAW IT IN FLAMES AND WITH THE HELP OF HIS NEIGHBOURS PULLED APART A PILE OF FAGGOTS WHICH HAD BEEN HEAPED UP BY THE SIDE WALL AND SET FIRE TO. IN THIS WAY HE SAVED THE HOUSE. BUT THERE WERE LODGERS IN THE HOUSE‚ÄÎTHE CAPTAIN, WHO WAS WELL KNOWN IN THE TOWN, HIS SISTER, AND THEIR ELDERLY SERVANT, AND THESE THREE PERSONS‚ÄÎTHE CAPTAIN, HIS SISTER, AND THEIR SERVANT‚ÄÎHAD BEEN MURDERED AND APPARENTLY ROBBED IN THE NIGHT. (IT WAS HERE THAT THE CHIEF OF POLICE HAD GONE WHILE LEMBKE WAS RESCUING THE FEATHER BED.)

BY MORNING THE NEWS HAD SPREAD AND AN IMMENSE CROWD OF ALL CLASSES, EVEN THE RIVERSIDE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN BURNT OUT HAD FLOCKED TO THE WASTE LAND WHERE THE NEW HOUSE STOOD. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET THERE, SO DENSE WAS THE CROWD. I WAS TOLD AT ONCE THAT THE CAPTAIN HAD BEEN FOUND LYING DRESSED ON THE BENCH WITH HIS THROAT CUT, AND THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN DEAD DRUNK WHEN HE WAS KILLED, SO THAT HE HAD FELT NOTHING, AND HE HAD ‚ÄÚBLED LIKE A BULL‚ÄÙ; THAT HIS SISTER MARYA TIMOFEYEVNA HAD BEEN ‚ÄÚSTABBED ALL OVER‚ÄÙ WITH A KNIFE AND SHE WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR IN THE DOORWAY, SO THAT PROBABLY SHE HAD BEEN AWAKE AND HAD FOUGHT AND STRUGGLED WITH THE MURDERER. THE SERVANT, WHO HAD ALSO PROBABLY BEEN AWAKE, HAD HER SKULL BROKEN. THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE SAID THAT THE CAPTAIN HAD COME TO SEE HIM THE MORNING BEFORE, AND THAT IN HIS DRUNKEN BRAGGING HE HAD SHOWN HIM A LOT OF MONEY, AS MUCH AS TWO HUNDRED ROUBLES. THE CAPTAIN‚ÄÔS SHABBY OLD GREEN POCKET-BOOK WAS FOUND EMPTY ON THE FLOOR, BUT MARYA TIMOFEYEVNA‚ÄÔS BOX HAD NOT BEEN TOUCHED, AND THE SILVER SETTING OF THE IKON HAD NOT BEEN REMOVED EITHER; THE CAPTAIN‚ÄÔS CLOTHES, TOO, HAD NOT BEEN DISTURBED. IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE THIEF HAD BEEN IN A HURRY AND WAS A MAN FAMILIAR WITH THE CAPTAIN‚ÄÔS CIRCUMSTANCES, WHO HAD COME ONLY FOR MONEY AND KNEW WHERE IT WAS KEPT. IF THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE HAD NOT RUN UP AT THAT MOMENT THE BURNING FAGGOT STACK WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE SET FIRE TO THE HOUSE AND ‚ÄÚIT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT FROM THE CHARRED CORPSES HOW THEY HAD DIED.‚ÄÙ

SO THE STORY WAS TOLD. ONE OTHER FACT WAS ADDED: THAT THE PERSON WHO HAD TAKEN THIS HOUSE FOR THE LEBYADKINS WAS NO OTHER THAN MR. STAVROGIN, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, THE SON OF VARVARA PETROVNA. HE HAD COME HIMSELF TO TAKE IT AND HAD HAD MUCH ADO TO PERSUADE THE OWNER TO LET IT, AS THE LATTER HAD INTENDED TO USE IT AS A TAVERN; BUT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH WAS READY TO GIVE ANY RENT HE ASKED AND HAD PAID FOR SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE.

‚ÄÚTHE FIRE WASN‚ÄÔT AN ACCIDENT,‚ÄÙ I HEARD SAID IN THE CROWD.

BUT THE MAJORITY SAID NOTHING. PEOPLE‚ÄÔS FACES WERE SULLEN, BUT I DID NOT SEE SIGNS OF MUCH INDIGNATION. PEOPLE PERSISTED, HOWEVER, IN GOSSIPING ABOUT STAVROGIN, SAYING THAT THE MURDERED WOMAN WAS HIS WIFE; THAT ON THE PREVIOUS DAY HE HAD ‚ÄÚDISHONOURABLY‚ÄÙ ABDUCTED A YOUNG LADY BELONGING TO THE BEST FAMILY IN THE PLACE, THE DAUGHTER OF MADAME DROZDOV, AND THAT A COMPLAINT WAS TO BE LODGED AGAINST HIM IN PETERSBURG; AND THAT HIS WIFE HAD BEEN MURDERED EVIDENTLY THAT HE MIGHT MARRY THE YOUNG LADY. SKVORESHNIKI WAS NOT MORE THAN A MILE AND A HALF AWAY, AND I REMEMBER I WONDERED WHETHER I SHOULD NOT LET THEM KNOW THE POSITION OF AFFAIRS. I DID NOT NOTICE, HOWEVER, THAT THERE WAS ANYONE EGGING THE CROWD ON AND I DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO ACCUSE PEOPLE FALSELY, THOUGH I DID SEE AND RECOGNISED AT ONCE IN THE CROWD AT THE FIRE TWO OR THREE OF THE ROWDY LOT I HAD SEEN IN THE REFRESHMENT-ROOM. I PARTICULARLY REMEMBER ONE THIN, TALL FELLOW, A CABINET-MAKER, AS I FOUND OUT LATER, WITH AN EMACIATED FACE AND A CURLY HEAD, BLACK AS THOUGH GRIMED WITH SOOT. HE WAS NOT DRUNK, BUT IN CONTRAST TO THE GLOOMY PASSIVITY OF THE CROWD SEEMED BESIDE HIMSELF WITH EXCITEMENT. HE KEPT ADDRESSING THE PEOPLE, THOUGH I DON‚ÄÔT REMEMBER HIS WORDS; NOTHING COHERENT THAT HE SAID WAS LONGER THAN ‚ÄÚI SAY, LADS, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THIS? ARE THINGS TO GO ON LIKE THIS?‚ÄÙ AND SO SAYING HE WAVED HIS ARMS.





CHAPTER III. A ROMANCE ENDED

I

FROM THE LARGE BALLROOM OF SKVORESHNIKI (THE ROOM IN WHICH THE LAST INTERVIEW WITH VARVARA PETROVNA AND STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HAD TAKEN PLACE) THE FIRE COULD BE PLAINLY SEEN. AT DAYBREAK, SOON AFTER FIVE IN THE MORNING, LIZA WAS STANDING AT THE FARTHEST WINDOW ON THE RIGHT LOOKING INTENTLY AT THE FADING GLOW. SHE WAS ALONE IN THE ROOM. SHE WAS WEARING THE DRESS SHE HAD WORN THE DAY BEFORE AT THE MATIN√©E‚ÄÎA VERY SMART LIGHT GREEN DRESS COVERED WITH LACE, BUT CRUSHED AND PUT ON CARELESSLY AND WITH HASTE. SUDDENLY NOTICING THAT SOME OF THE HOOKS WERE UNDONE IN FRONT SHE FLUSHED, HURRIEDLY SET IT RIGHT, SNATCHED UP FROM A CHAIR THE RED SHAWL SHE HAD FLUNG DOWN WHEN SHE CAME IN THE DAY BEFORE, AND PUT IT ROUND HER NECK. SOME LOCKS OF HER LUXURIANT HAIR HAD COME LOOSE AND SHOWED BELOW THE SHAWL ON HER RIGHT SHOULDER. HER FACE LOOKED WEARY AND CAREWORN, BUT HER EYES GLOWED UNDER HER FROWNING BROWS. SHE WENT UP TO THE WINDOW AGAIN AND PRESSED HER BURNING FOREHEAD AGAINST THE COLD PANE. THE DOOR OPENED AND NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH CAME IN.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE SENT A MESSENGER ON HORSEBACK,‚ÄÙ HE SAID. ‚ÄÚIN TEN MINUTES WE SHALL HEAR ALL ABOUT IT, MEANTIME THE SERVANTS SAY THAT PART OF THE RIVERSIDE QUARTER HAS BEEN BURNT DOWN, ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRIDGE NEAR THE QUAY. IT‚ÄÔS BEEN BURNING SINCE ELEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK; NOW THE FIRE IS GOING DOWN.‚ÄÙ

HE DID NOT GO NEAR THE WINDOW, BUT STOOD THREE STEPS BEHIND HER; SHE DID NOT TURN TOWARDS HIM.

‚ÄÚIT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN LIGHT AN HOUR AGO BY THE CALENDAR, AND IT‚ÄÔS STILL ALMOST NIGHT,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID IRRITABLY.

‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒCALENDARS ALWAYS TELL LIES,‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ HE OBSERVED WITH A POLITE SMILE, BUT, A LITTLE ASHAMED; HE MADE HASTE TO ADD: ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS DULL TO LIVE BY THE CALENDAR, LIZA.‚ÄÙ

AND HE RELAPSED INTO SILENCE, VEXED AT THE INEPTITUDE OF THE SECOND SENTENCE. LIZA GAVE A WRY SMILE.

‚ÄÚYOU ARE IN SUCH A MELANCHOLY MOOD THAT YOU CANNOT EVEN FIND WORDS TO SPEAK TO ME. BUT YOU NEED NOT TROUBLE, THERE‚ÄÔS A POINT IN WHAT YOU SAID. I ALWAYS LIVE BY THE CALENDAR. EVERY STEP I TAKE IS REGULATED BY THE CALENDAR. DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU?‚ÄÙ

SHE TURNED QUICKLY FROM THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN IN A LOW CHAIR.

‚ÄÚYOU SIT DOWN, TOO, PLEASE. WE HAVEN‚ÄÔT LONG TO BE TOGETHER AND I WANT TO SAY ANYTHING I LIKE.‚Ä¶ WHY SHOULDN‚ÄÔT YOU, TOO, SAY ANYTHING YOU LIKE?‚ÄÙ

NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH SAT BESIDE HER AND SOFTLY, ALMOST TIMIDLY TOOK HER HAND.

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THE MEANING OF THIS TONE, LIZA? WHERE HAS IT SUDDENLY SPRUNG FROM? WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ‚ÄÒWE HAVEN‚ÄÔT LONG TO BE TOGETHER‚ÄÔ? THAT‚ÄÔS THE SECOND MYSTERIOUS PHRASE SINCE YOU WAKED, HALF AN HOUR AGO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE BEGINNING TO RECKON UP MY MYSTERIOUS PHRASES!‚ÄÙ SHE LAUGHED. ‚ÄÚDO YOU REMEMBER I TOLD YOU I WAS A DEAD WOMAN WHEN I CAME IN YESTERDAY? THAT YOU THOUGHT FIT TO FORGET. TO FORGET OR NOT TO NOTICE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT REMEMBER, LIZA. WHY DEAD? YOU MUST LIVE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND IS THAT ALL? YOU‚ÄÔVE QUITE LOST YOUR FLOW OF WORDS. I‚ÄÔVE LIVED MY HOUR AND THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH. DO YOU REMEMBER CHRISTOPHER IVANOVITCH?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO I DON‚ÄÔT,‚ÄÙ HE ANSWERED, FROWNING.

‚ÄÚCHRISTOPHER IVANOVITCH AT LAUSANNE? HE BORED YOU DREADFULLY. HE ALWAYS USED TO OPEN THE DOOR AND SAY, ‚ÄÒI‚ÄÔVE COME FOR ONE MINUTE,‚ÄÔ AND THEN STAY THE WHOLE DAY. I DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO BE LIKE CHRISTOPHER IVANOVITCH AND STAY THE WHOLE DAY.‚ÄÙ

A LOOK OF PAIN CAME INTO HIS FACE.

‚ÄÚLIZA, IT GRIEVES ME, THIS UNNATURAL LANGUAGE. THIS AFFECTATION MUST HURT YOU, TOO. WHAT‚ÄÔS IT FOR? WHAT‚ÄÔS THE OBJECT OF IT?‚ÄÙ

HIS EYES GLOWED.

‚ÄÚLIZA,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, ‚ÄÚI SWEAR I LOVE YOU NOW MORE THAN YESTERDAY WHEN YOU CAME TO ME!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT A STRANGE DECLARATION! WHY BRING IN YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY AND THESE COMPARISONS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU WON‚ÄÔT LEAVE ME,‚ÄÙ HE WENT ON, ALMOST WITH DESPAIR; ‚ÄÚWE WILL GO AWAY TOGETHER, TO-DAY, WON‚ÄÔT WE? WON‚ÄÔT WE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAIE, DON‚ÄÔT SQUEEZE MY HAND SO PAINFULLY! WHERE COULD WE GO TOGETHER TO-DAY? TO ‚ÄÒRISE AGAIN‚ÄÔ SOMEWHERE? NO, WE‚ÄÔVE MADE EXPERIMENTS ENOUGH ‚Ä¶ AND IT‚ÄÔS TOO SLOW FOR ME; AND I AM NOT FIT FOR IT; IT‚ÄÔS TOO EXALTED FOR ME. IF WE ARE TO GO, LET IT BE TO MOSCOW, TO PAY VISITS AND ENTERTAIN‚ÄÎTHAT‚ÄÔS MY IDEAL YOU KNOW; EVEN IN SWITZERLAND I DIDN‚ÄÔT DISGUISE FROM YOU WHAT I WAS LIKE. AS WE CAN‚ÄÔT GO TO MOSCOW AND PAY VISITS SINCE YOU ARE MARRIED, IT‚ÄÔS NO USE TALKING OF THAT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLIZA! WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT HAPPENED IS OVER!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS IMPOSSIBLE! THAT‚ÄÔS CRUEL!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT IF IT IS CRUEL? YOU MUST BEAR IT IF IT IS CRUEL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE AVENGING YOURSELF ON ME FOR YESTERDAY‚ÄÔS CAPRICE,‚ÄÙ HE MUTTERED WITH AN ANGRY SMILE. LIZA FLUSHED.

‚ÄÚWHAT A MEAN THOUGHT!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY THEN DID YOU BESTOW ON ME ‚Ä¶ SO GREAT A HAPPINESS? HAVE I THE RIGHT TO KNOW?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, YOU MUST MANAGE WITHOUT RIGHTS; DON‚ÄÔT AGGRAVATE THE MEANNESS OF YOUR SUPPOSITION BY STUPIDITY. YOU ARE NOT LUCKY TO-DAY. BY THE WAY, YOU SURELY CAN‚ÄÔT BE AFRAID OF PUBLIC OPINION AND THAT YOU WILL BE BLAMED FOR THIS ‚ÄÒGREAT HAPPINESS‚ÄÔ? IF THAT‚ÄÔS IT, FOR GOD‚ÄÔS SAKE DON‚ÄÔT ALARM YOURSELF. IT‚ÄÔS NOT YOUR DOING AT ALL AND YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE TO ANYONE. WHEN I OPENED YOUR DOOR YESTERDAY, YOU DIDN‚ÄÔT EVEN KNOW WHO WAS COMING IN. IT WAS SIMPLY MY CAPRICE, AS YOU EXPRESSED IT JUST NOW, AND NOTHING MORE! YOU CAN LOOK EVERY ONE IN THE FACE BOLDLY AND TRIUMPHANTLY!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOUR WORDS, THAT LAUGH, HAVE BEEN MAKING ME FEEL COLD WITH HORROR FOR THE LAST HOUR. THAT ‚ÄÒHAPPINESS‚ÄÔ OF WHICH YOU SPEAK FRANTICALLY IS WORTH ‚Ä¶ EVERYTHING TO ME. HOW CAN I LOSE YOU NOW? I SWEAR I LOVED YOU LESS YESTERDAY. WHY ARE YOU TAKING EVERYTHING FROM ME TO-DAY? DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT HAS COST ME, THIS NEW HOPE? I‚ÄÔVE PAID FOR IT WITH LIFE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOUR OWN LIFE OR ANOTHER‚ÄÔS?‚ÄÙ

HE GOT UP QUICKLY.

‚ÄÚWHAT DOES THAT MEAN?‚ÄÙ HE BROUGHT OUT, LOOKING AT HER STEADILY.

‚ÄÚHAVE YOU PAID FOR IT WITH YOUR LIFE OR WITH MINE? IS WHAT I MEAN. OR HAVE YOU LOST ALL POWER OF UNDERSTANDING?‚ÄÙ CRIED LIZA, FLUSHING. ‚ÄÚWHY DID YOU START UP SO SUDDENLY? WHY DO YOU STARE AT ME WITH SUCH A LOOK? YOU FRIGHTEN ME. WHAT IS IT YOU ARE AFRAID OF ALL THE TIME? I NOTICED SOME TIME AGO THAT YOU WERE AFRAID AND YOU ARE NOW, THIS VERY MINUTE ‚Ä¶ GOOD HEAVENS, HOW PALE YOU ARE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF YOU KNOW ANYTHING, LIZA, I SWEAR I DON‚ÄÔT ‚Ä¶ AND I WASN‚ÄÔT TALKING OF THAT JUST NOW WHEN I SAID THAT I HAD PAID FOR IT WITH LIFE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND YOU,‚ÄÙ SHE BROUGHT OUT, FALTERING APPREHENSIVELY.

AT LAST A SLOW BROODING SMILE CAME ON TO HIS LIPS. HE SLOWLY SAT DOWN, PUT HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES, AND COVERED HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS.

‚ÄÚA BAD DREAM AND DELIRIUM.‚Ä¶ WE WERE TALKING OF TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT.‚Ä¶ DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU DID NOT KNOW YESTERDAY THAT I SHOULD LEAVE YOU TO-DAY, DID YOU KNOW OR NOT? DON‚ÄÔT TELL A LIE, DID YOU OR NOT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DID,‚ÄÙ HE SAID SOFTLY.

‚ÄÚWELL THEN, WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE? YOU KNEW AND YET YOU ACCEPTED ‚ÄÒTHAT MOMENT‚ÄÔ FOR YOURSELF. AREN‚ÄÔT WE QUITS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTELL ME THE WHOLE TRUTH,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED IN INTENSE DISTRESS. ‚ÄÚWHEN YOU OPENED MY DOOR YESTERDAY, DID YOU KNOW YOURSELF THAT IT WAS ONLY FOR ONE HOUR?‚ÄÙ

SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH HATRED.

‚ÄÚREALLY, THE MOST SENSIBLE PERSON CAN ASK MOST AMAZING QUESTIONS. AND WHY ARE YOU SO UNEASY? CAN IT BE VANITY THAT A WOMAN SHOULD LEAVE YOU FIRST INSTEAD OF YOUR LEAVING HER? DO YOU KNOW, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, SINCE I‚ÄÔVE BEEN WITH YOU I‚ÄÔVE DISCOVERED THAT YOU ARE VERY GENEROUS TO ME, AND IT‚ÄÔS JUST THAT I CAN‚ÄÔT ENDURE FROM YOU.‚ÄÙ

HE GOT UP FROM HIS SEAT AND TOOK A FEW STEPS ABOUT THE ROOM.

‚ÄÚVERY WELL, PERHAPS IT WAS BOUND TO END SO.‚Ä¶ BUT HOW CAN IT ALL HAVE HAPPENED?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS A QUESTION TO WORRY ABOUT! ESPECIALLY AS YOU KNOW THE ANSWER YOURSELF PERFECTLY WELL, AND UNDERSTAND IT BETTER THAN ANYONE ON EARTH, AND WERE COUNTING ON IT YOURSELF. I AM A YOUNG LADY, MY HEART HAS BEEN TRAINED ON THE OPERA, THAT‚ÄÔS HOW IT ALL BEGAN, THAT‚ÄÔS THE SOLUTION.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHERE IS NOTHING IN IT TO FRET YOUR VANITY. IT IS ALL THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH. IT BEGAN WITH A FINE MOMENT WHICH WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME TO BEAR. THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY, WHEN I ‚ÄÒINSULTED‚ÄÔ YOU BEFORE EVERY ONE AND YOU ANSWERED ME SO CHIVALROUSLY, I WENT HOME AND GUESSED AT ONCE THAT YOU WERE RUNNING AWAY FROM ME BECAUSE YOU WERE MARRIED, AND NOT FROM CONTEMPT FOR ME WHICH, AS A FASHIONABLE YOUNG LADY, I DREADED MORE THAN ANYTHING. I UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS FOR MY SAKE, FOR ME, MAD AS I WAS, THAT YOU RAN AWAY. YOU SEE HOW I APPRECIATE YOUR GENEROSITY. THEN PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SKIPPED UP TO ME AND EXPLAINED IT ALL TO ME AT ONCE. HE REVEALED TO ME THAT YOU WERE DOMINATED BY A ‚ÄÒGREAT IDEA,‚ÄÔ BEFORE WHICH HE AND I WERE AS NOTHING, BUT YET THAT I WAS A STUMBLING-BLOCK IN YOUR PATH. HE BROUGHT HIMSELF IN, HE INSISTED THAT WE THREE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER, AND SAID THE MOST FANTASTIC THINGS ABOUT A BOAT AND ABOUT MAPLE-WOOD OARS OUT OF SOME RUSSIAN SONG. I COMPLIMENTED HIM AND TOLD HIM HE WAS A POET, WHICH HE SWALLOWED AS THE REAL THING. AND AS APART FROM HIM I HAD KNOWN LONG BEFORE THAT I HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO DO ANYTHING FOR LONG, I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SPOT. WELL, THAT‚ÄÔS ALL AND QUITE ENOUGH, AND PLEASE LET US HAVE NO MORE EXPLANATIONS. WE MIGHT QUARREL. DON‚ÄÔT BE AFRAID OF ANYONE, I TAKE IT ALL ON MYSELF. I AM HORRID AND CAPRICIOUS, I WAS FASCINATED BY THAT OPERATIC BOAT, I AM A YOUNG LADY ‚Ä¶ BUT YOU KNOW I DID THINK THAT YOU WERE DREADFULLY IN LOVE WITH ME. DON‚ÄÔT DESPISE THE POOR FOOL, AND DON‚ÄÔT LAUGH AT THE TEAR THAT DROPPED JUST NOW. I AM AWFULLY GIVEN TO CRYING WITH SELF-PITY. COME, THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH, THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH. I AM NO GOOD FOR ANYTHING AND YOU ARE NO GOOD FOR ANYTHING; IT‚ÄÔS AS BAD FOR BOTH OF US, SO LET‚ÄÔS COMFORT OURSELVES WITH THAT. ANYWAY, IT EASES OUR VANITY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDREAM AND DELIRIUM,‚ÄÙ CRIED STAVROGIN, WRINGING HIS HANDS, AND PACING ABOUT THE ROOM. ‚ÄÚLIZA, POOR CHILD, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO YOURSELF?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE BURNT MYSELF IN A CANDLE, NOTHING MORE. SURELY YOU ARE NOT CRYING, TOO? YOU SHOULD SHOW LESS FEELING AND BETTER BREEDING.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, WHY DID YOU COME TO ME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT A LUDICROUS POSITION YOU PUT YOURSELF IN IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD BY ASKING SUCH QUESTIONS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY HAVE YOU RUINED YOURSELF, SO GROTESQUELY AND SO STUPIDLY, AND WHAT‚ÄÔS TO BE DONE NOW?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND THIS IS STAVROGIN, ‚ÄÒTHE VAMPIRE STAVROGIN,‚ÄÔ AS YOU ARE CALLED BY A LADY HERE WHO IS IN LOVE WITH YOU! LISTEN! I HAVE TOLD YOU ALREADY, I‚ÄÔVE PUT ALL MY LIFE INTO ONE HOUR AND I AM AT PEACE. DO THE SAME WITH YOURS ‚Ä¶ THOUGH YOU‚ÄÔVE NO NEED TO: YOU HAVE PLENTY OF ‚ÄÒHOURS‚ÄÔ AND ‚ÄÒMOMENTS‚ÄÔ OF ALL SORTS BEFORE YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAS MANY AS YOU; I GIVE YOU MY SOLEMN WORD, NOT ONE HOUR MORE THAN YOU!‚ÄÙ

HE WAS STILL WALKING UP AND DOWN AND DID NOT SEE THE RAPID PENETRATING GLANCE SHE TURNED UPON HIM, IN WHICH THERE SEEMED A DAWNING HOPE. BUT THE LIGHT DIED AWAY AT THE SAME MOMENT.

‚ÄÚIF YOU KNEW WHAT IT COSTS ME THAT I CAN‚ÄÔT BE SINCERE AT THIS MOMENT, LIZA, IF I COULD ONLY TELL YOU ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTELL ME? YOU WANT TO TELL ME SOMETHING, TO ME? GOD SAVE ME FROM YOUR SECRETS!‚ÄÙ SHE BROKE IN ALMOST IN TERROR. HE STOPPED AND WAITED UNEASILY.

‚ÄÚI OUGHT TO CONFESS THAT EVER SINCE THOSE DAYS IN SWITZERLAND I HAVE HAD A STRONG FEELING THAT YOU HAVE SOMETHING AWFUL, LOATHSOME, SOME BLOODSHED ON YOUR CONSCIENCE ‚Ä¶ AND YET SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE YOU LOOK VERY RIDICULOUS. BEWARE OF TELLING ME, IF IT‚ÄÔS TRUE: I SHALL LAUGH YOU TO SCORN. I SHALL LAUGH AT YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.‚Ä¶ AIE, YOU ARE TURNING PALE AGAIN? I WON‚ÄÔT, I WON‚ÄÔT, I‚ÄÔLL GO AT ONCE.‚ÄÙ SHE JUMPED UP FROM HER CHAIR WITH A MOVEMENT OF DISGUST AND CONTEMPT.

‚ÄÚTORTURE ME, PUNISH ME, VENT YOUR SPITE ON ME,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED IN DESPAIR. ‚ÄÚYOU HAVE THE FULL RIGHT. I KNEW I DID NOT LOVE YOU AND YET I RUINED YOU! YES, I ACCEPTED THE MOMENT FOR MY OWN; I HAD A HOPE ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔVE HAD IT A LONG TIME ‚Ä¶ MY LAST HOPE.‚Ä¶ I COULD NOT RESIST THE RADIANCE THAT FLOODED MY HEART WHEN YOU CAME IN TO ME YESTERDAY, OF YOURSELF, ALONE, OF YOUR OWN ACCORD. I SUDDENLY BELIEVED.‚Ä¶ PERHAPS I HAVE FAITH IN IT STILL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WILL REPAY SUCH NOBLE FRANKNESS BY BEING AS FRANK. I DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO BE A SISTER OF MERCY FOR YOU. PERHAPS I REALLY MAY BECOME A NURSE UNLESS I HAPPEN APPROPRIATELY TO DIE TO-DAY; BUT IF I DO I WON‚ÄÔT BE YOUR NURSE, THOUGH, OF COURSE, YOU NEED ONE AS MUCH AS ANY CRIPPLED CREATURE. I ALWAYS FANCIED THAT YOU WOULD TAKE ME TO SOME PLACE WHERE THERE WAS A HUGE WICKED SPIDER, BIG AS A MAN, AND WE SHOULD SPEND OUR LIVES LOOKING AT IT AND BEING AFRAID OF IT. THAT‚ÄÔS HOW OUR LOVE WOULD SPEND ITSELF. APPEAL TO DASHENKA; SHE WILL GO WITH YOU ANYWHERE YOU LIKE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCAN‚ÄÔT YOU HELP THINKING OF HER EVEN NOW?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPOOR LITTLE SPANIEL! GIVE HER MY GREETINGS. DOES SHE KNOW THAT EVEN IN SWITZERLAND YOU HAD FIXED ON HER FOR YOUR OLD AGE? WHAT PRUDENCE! WHAT FORESIGHT! AIE, WHO‚ÄÔS THAT?‚ÄÙ

AT THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM A DOOR OPENED A CRACK; A HEAD WAS THRUST IN AND VANISHED AGAIN HURRIEDLY.

‚ÄÚIS THAT YOU, ALEXEY YEGORYTCH?‚ÄÙ ASKED STAVROGIN.

‚ÄÚNO, IT‚ÄÔS ONLY I.‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH THRUST HIMSELF HALF IN AGAIN. ‚ÄÚHOW DO YOU DO, LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA? GOOD MORNING, ANYWAY. I GUESSED I SHOULD FIND YOU BOTH IN THIS ROOM. I HAVE COME FOR ONE MOMENT LITERALLY, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH. I WAS ANXIOUS TO HAVE A COUPLE OF WORDS WITH YOU AT ALL COSTS ‚Ä¶ ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY ‚Ä¶ ONLY A FEW WORDS!‚ÄÙ

STAVROGIN MOVED TOWARDS HIM BUT TURNED BACK TO LIZA AT THE THIRD STEP.

‚ÄÚIF YOU HEAR ANYTHING DIRECTLY, LIZA, LET ME TELL YOU I AM TO BLAME FOR IT!‚ÄÙ

SHE STARTED AND LOOKED AT HIM IN DISMAY; BUT HE HURRIEDLY WENT OUT.

II

THE ROOM FROM WHICH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD PEEPED IN WAS A LARGE OVAL VESTIBULE. ALEXEY YEGORYTCH HAD BEEN SITTING THERE BEFORE PYOTR STEPANOVITCH CAME IN, BUT THE LATTER SENT HIM AWAY. STAVROGIN CLOSED THE DOOR AFTER HIM AND STOOD EXPECTANT. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH LOOKED RAPIDLY AND SEARCHINGLY AT HIM.

‚ÄÚWELL?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF YOU KNOW ALREADY,‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HURRIEDLY, HIS EYES LOOKING AS THOUGH THEY WOULD DIVE INTO STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS SOUL, ‚ÄÚTHEN, OF COURSE, WE ARE NONE OF US TO BLAME, ABOVE ALL NOT YOU, FOR IT‚ÄÔS SUCH A CONCATENATION ‚Ä¶ SUCH A COINCIDENCE OF EVENTS ‚Ä¶ IN BRIEF, YOU CAN‚ÄÔT BE LEGALLY IMPLICATED AND I‚ÄÔVE RUSHED HERE TO TELL YOU SO BEFOREHAND.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHAVE THEY BEEN BURNT? MURDERED?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMURDERED BUT NOT BURNT, THAT‚ÄÔS THE TROUBLE, BUT I GIVE YOU MY WORD OF HONOUR THAT IT‚ÄÔS NOT BEEN MY FAULT, HOWEVER MUCH YOU MAY SUSPECT ME, EH? DO YOU WANT THE WHOLE TRUTH: YOU SEE THE IDEA REALLY DID CROSS MY MIND‚ÄÎYOU HINTED IT YOURSELF, NOT SERIOUSLY, BUT TEASING ME (FOR, OF COURSE, YOU WOULD NOT HINT IT SERIOUSLY), BUT I COULDN‚ÄÔT BRING MYSELF TO IT, AND WOULDN‚ÄÔT BRING MYSELF TO IT FOR ANYTHING, NOT FOR A HUNDRED ROUBLES‚ÄÎAND WHAT WAS THERE TO BE GAINED BY IT, I MEAN FOR ME, FOR ME.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ (HE WAS IN DESPERATE HASTE AND HIS TALK WAS LIKE THE CLACKING OF A RATTLE.) ‚ÄÚBUT WHAT A COINCIDENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES: I GAVE THAT DRUNKEN FOOL LEBYADKIN TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY ROUBLES OF MY OWN MONEY (DO YOU HEAR, MY OWN MONEY, THERE WASN‚ÄÔT A ROUBLE OF YOURS AND, WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, YOU KNOW IT YOURSELF) THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY, IN THE EVENING‚ÄÎDO YOU HEAR, NOT YESTERDAY AFTER THE MATIN√©E, BUT THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY, MAKE A NOTE OF IT: IT‚ÄÔS A VERY IMPORTANT COINCIDENCE FOR I DID NOT KNOW FOR CERTAIN AT THAT TIME WHETHER LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA WOULD COME TO YOU OR NOT; I GAVE MY OWN MONEY SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU DISTINGUISHED YOURSELF BY TAKING IT INTO YOUR HEAD TO BETRAY YOUR SECRET TO EVERY ONE. WELL, I WON‚ÄÔT GO INTO THAT ‚Ä¶ THAT‚ÄÔS YOUR AFFAIR ‚Ä¶ YOUR CHIVALRY, BUT I MUST OWN I WAS AMAZED, IT WAS A KNOCK-DOWN BLOW. AND FORASMUCH AS I WAS EXCEEDING WEARY OF THESE TRAGIC STORIES‚ÄÎAND LET ME TELL YOU, I TALK SERIOUSLY THOUGH I DO USE BIBLICAL LANGUAGE‚ÄÎAS IT WAS ALL UPSETTING MY PLANS IN FACT, I MADE UP MY MIND AT ANY COST, AND WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE, TO PACK THE LEBYADKINS OFF TO PETERSBURG, ESPECIALLY AS HE WAS SET ON GOING HIMSELF. I MADE ONE MISTAKE: I GAVE THE MONEY IN YOUR NAME;‚ÄÎWAS IT A MISTAKE OR NOT? PERHAPS IT WASN‚ÄÔT A MISTAKE, EH? LISTEN NOW, LISTEN HOW IT HAS ALL TURNED OUT.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

IN THE HEAT OF HIS TALK HE WENT CLOSE UP TO STAVROGIN AND TOOK HOLD OF THE REVERS OF HIS COAT (REALLY, IT MAY HAVE BEEN ON PURPOSE). WITH A VIOLENT MOVEMENT STAVROGIN STRUCK HIM ON THE ARM.

‚ÄÚCOME, WHAT IS IT ‚Ä¶ GIVE OVER ‚Ä¶ YOU‚ÄÔLL BREAK MY ARM ‚Ä¶ WHAT MATTERS IS THE WAY THINGS HAVE TURNED OUT,‚ÄÙ HE RATTLED ON, NOT IN THE LEAST SURPRISED AT THE BLOW. ‚ÄÚI FORKED OUT THE MONEY IN THE EVENING ON CONDITION THAT HIS SISTER AND HE SHOULD SET OFF EARLY NEXT MORNING; I TRUSTED THAT RASCAL LIPUTIN WITH THE JOB OF GETTING THEM INTO THE TRAIN AND SEEING THEM OFF. BUT THAT BEAST LIPUTIN WANTED TO PLAY HIS SCHOOLBOY PRANKS ON THE PUBLIC‚ÄÎPERHAPS YOU HEARD? AT THE MATIN√©E? LISTEN, LISTEN: THEY BOTH GOT DRUNK, MADE UP VERSES OF WHICH HALF ARE LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS; HE RIGGED LEBYADKIN OUT IN A DRESS-COAT, ASSURING ME MEANWHILE THAT HE HAD PACKED HIM OFF THAT MORNING, BUT HE KEPT HIM SHUT SOMEWHERE IN A BACK ROOM, TILL HE THRUST HIM ON THE PLATFORM AT THE MATIN√©E. BUT LEBYADKIN GOT DRUNK QUICKLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY. THEN CAME THE SCANDALOUS SCENE YOU KNOW OF, AND THEN THEY GOT HIM HOME MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE, AND LIPUTIN FILCHED AWAY THE TWO HUNDRED ROUBLES, LEAVING HIM ONLY SMALL CHANGE. BUT IT APPEARS UNLUCKILY THAT ALREADY THAT MORNING LEBYADKIN HAD TAKEN THAT TWO HUNDRED ROUBLES OUT OF HIS POCKET, BOASTED OF IT AND SHOWN IT IN UNDESIRABLE QUARTERS. AND AS THAT WAS JUST WHAT FEDKA WAS EXPECTING, AND AS HE HAD HEARD SOMETHING AT KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS (DO YOU REMEMBER, YOUR HINT?) HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. THAT‚ÄÔS THE WHOLE TRUTH. I AM GLAD, ANYWAY, THAT FEDKA DID NOT FIND THE MONEY, THE RASCAL WAS RECKONING ON A THOUSAND, YOU KNOW! HE WAS IN A HURRY AND SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENED BY THE FIRE HIMSELF.‚Ä¶ WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT, THAT FIRE CAME AS A THUNDERBOLT FOR ME. DEVIL ONLY KNOWS WHAT TO MAKE OF IT! IT IS TAKING THINGS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS.‚Ä¶ YOU SEE, AS I EXPECT SO MUCH OF YOU I WILL HIDE NOTHING FROM YOU: I‚ÄÔVE LONG BEEN HATCHING THIS IDEA OF A FIRE BECAUSE IT SUITS THE NATIONAL AND POPULAR TASTE; BUT I WAS KEEPING IT FOR A CRITICAL MOMENT, FOR THAT PRECIOUS TIME WHEN WE SHOULD ALL RISE UP AND ‚Ä¶ AND THEY SUDDENLY TOOK IT INTO THEIR HEADS TO DO IT, ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE, WITHOUT ORDERS, NOW AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN WE OUGHT TO BE LYING LOW AND KEEPING QUIET! SUCH PRESUMPTION!‚Ä¶ THE FACT IS, I‚ÄÔVE NOT GOT TO THE BOTTOM OF IT YET, THEY TALK ABOUT TWO SHPIGULIN MEN, BUT IF THERE ARE ANY OF OUR FELLOWS IN IT, IF ANY ONE OF THEM HAS HAD A HAND IN IT‚ÄÎSO MUCH THE WORSE FOR HIM! YOU SEE WHAT COMES OF LETTING PEOPLE GET EVER SO LITTLE OUT OF HAND! NO, THIS DEMOCRATIC RABBLE, WITH ITS QUINTETS, IS A POOR FOUNDATION; WHAT WE WANT IS ONE MAGNIFICENT, DESPOTIC WILL, LIKE AN IDOL, RESTING ON SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL AND EXTERNAL.‚Ä¶ THEN THE QUINTETS WILL CRINGE INTO OBEDIENCE AND BE OBSEQUIOUSLY READY ON OCCASION. BUT, ANYWAY, THOUGH, THEY ARE ALL CRYING OUT NOW THAT STAVROGIN WANTED HIS WIFE TO BE BURNT AND THAT THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT CAUSED THE FIRE IN THE TOWN, BUT ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, ARE THEY ALL SAYING THAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, NOT YET, AND I MUST CONFESS I HAVE HEARD NOTHING OF THE SORT, BUT WHAT ONE CAN DO WITH PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY‚ÄÔVE BEEN BURNT OUT! VOX POPULI VOX DEI. A STUPID RUMOUR IS SOON SET GOING. BUT YOU REALLY HAVE NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF. FROM THE LEGAL POINT OF VIEW YOU ARE ALL RIGHT, AND WITH YOUR CONSCIENCE ALSO. FOR YOU DIDN‚ÄÔT WANT IT DONE, DID YOU? THERE‚ÄÔS NO CLUE, NOTHING BUT THE COINCIDENCE.‚Ä¶ THE ONLY THING IS FEDKA MAY REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID THAT NIGHT AT KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS (AND WHAT MADE YOU SAY IT?) BUT THAT PROVES NOTHING AND WE SHALL STOP FEDKA‚ÄÔS MOUTH. I SHALL STOP IT TO-DAY.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND WEREN‚ÄÔT THE BODIES BURNT AT ALL?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOT A BIT; THAT RUFFIAN COULD NOT MANAGE ANYTHING PROPERLY. BUT I AM GLAD, ANYWAY, THAT YOU ARE SO CALM ‚Ä¶ FOR THOUGH YOU ARE NOT IN ANY WAY TO BLAME, EVEN IN THOUGHT, BUT ALL THE SAME.‚Ä¶ AND YOU MUST ADMIT THAT ALL THIS SETTLES YOUR DIFFICULTIES CAPITALLY: YOU ARE SUDDENLY FREE AND A WIDOWER AND CAN MARRY A CHARMING GIRL THIS MINUTE WITH A LOT OF MONEY, WHO IS ALREADY YOURS, INTO THE BARGAIN. SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE BY CRUDE, SIMPLE COINCIDENCE‚ÄÎEH?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚARE YOU THREATENING ME, YOU FOOL?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCOME, LEAVE OFF, LEAVE OFF! HERE YOU ARE, CALLING ME A FOOL, AND WHAT A TONE TO USE! YOU OUGHT TO BE GLAD, YET YOU ‚Ä¶ I RUSHED HERE ON PURPOSE TO LET YOU KNOW IN GOOD TIME.‚Ä¶ BESIDES, HOW COULD I THREATEN YOU? AS IF I CARED FOR WHAT I COULD GET BY THREATS! I WANT YOU TO HELP FROM GOODWILL AND NOT FROM FEAR. YOU ARE THE LIGHT AND THE SUN.‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS I WHO AM TERRIBLY AFRAID OF YOU, NOT YOU OF ME! I AM NOT MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH.‚Ä¶ AND ONLY FANCY, AS I FLEW HERE IN A RACING DROSHKY I SAW MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH BY THE FENCE AT THE FARTHEST CORNER OF YOUR GARDEN ‚Ä¶ IN HIS GREATCOAT, DRENCHED THROUGH, HE MUST HAVE BEEN SITTING THERE ALL NIGHT! QUEER GOINGS ON! HOW MAD PEOPLE CAN BE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH? IS THAT TRUE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, YES. HE IS SITTING BY THE GARDEN FENCE. ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PACES FROM HERE, I THINK. I MADE HASTE TO PASS HIM, BUT HE SAW ME. DIDN‚ÄÔT YOU KNOW? IN THAT CASE I AM GLAD I DIDN‚ÄÔT FORGET TO TELL YOU. A MAN LIKE THAT IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN ANYONE IF HE HAPPENS TO HAVE A REVOLVER ABOUT HIM, AND THEN THE NIGHT, THE SLEET, OR NATURAL IRRITABILITY‚ÄÎFOR AFTER ALL HE IS IN A NICE POSITION, HA HA! WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHY IS HE SITTING THERE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE IS WAITING FOR LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA, OF COURSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL! WHY SHOULD SHE GO OUT TO HIM? AND ‚Ä¶ IN SUCH RAIN TOO ‚Ä¶ WHAT A FOOL!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSHE IS JUST GOING OUT TO HIM!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEH! THAT‚ÄÔS A PIECE OF NEWS! SO THEN ‚Ä¶ BUT LISTEN, HER POSITION IS COMPLETELY CHANGED NOW. WHAT DOES SHE WANT WITH MAVRIKY NOW? YOU ARE FREE, A WIDOWER, AND CAN MARRY HER TO-MORROW. SHE DOESN‚ÄÔT KNOW YET‚ÄÎLEAVE IT TO ME AND I‚ÄÔLL ARRANGE IT ALL FOR YOU. WHERE IS SHE? WE MUST RELIEVE HER MIND TOO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚRELIEVE HER MIND?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚRATHER! LET‚ÄÔS GO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE WON‚ÄÔT GUESS WHAT THOSE DEAD BODIES MEAN?‚ÄÙ SAID STAVROGIN, SCREWING UP HIS EYES IN A PECULIAR WAY.

‚ÄÚOF COURSE SHE WON‚ÄÔT,‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WITH ALL THE CONFIDENCE OF A PERFECT SIMPLETON, ‚ÄÚFOR LEGALLY ‚Ä¶ ECH, WHAT A MAN YOU ARE! WHAT IF SHE DID GUESS? WOMEN ARE SO CLEVER AT SHUTTING THEIR EYES TO SUCH THINGS, YOU DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND WOMEN! APART FROM IT‚ÄÔS BEING ALTOGETHER TO HER INTEREST TO MARRY YOU NOW, BECAUSE THERE‚ÄÔS NO DENYING SHE‚ÄÔS DISGRACED HERSELF; APART FROM THAT, I TALKED TO HER OF ‚ÄÒTHE BOAT‚ÄÔ AND I SAW THAT ONE COULD AFFECT HER BY IT, SO THAT SHOWS YOU WHAT THE GIRL IS MADE OF. DON‚ÄÔT BE UNEASY, SHE WILL STEP OVER THOSE DEAD BODIES WITHOUT TURNING A HAIR‚ÄÎESPECIALLY AS YOU ARE NOT TO BLAME FOR THEM; NOT IN THE LEAST, ARE YOU? SHE WILL ONLY KEEP THEM IN RESERVE TO USE THEM AGAINST YOU WHEN YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN MARRIED TWO OR THREE YEARS. EVERY WOMAN SAVES UP SOMETHING OF THE SORT OUT OF HER HUSBAND‚ÄÔS PAST WHEN SHE GETS MARRIED, BUT BY THAT TIME ‚Ä¶ WHAT MAY NOT HAPPEN IN A YEAR? HA HA!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF YOU‚ÄÔVE COME IN A RACING DROSHKY, TAKE HER TO MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH NOW. SHE SAID JUST NOW THAT SHE COULD NOT ENDURE ME AND WOULD LEAVE ME, AND SHE CERTAINLY WILL NOT ACCEPT MY CARRIAGE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT! CAN SHE REALLY BE LEAVING? HOW CAN THIS HAVE COME ABOUT?‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, STARING STUPIDLY AT HIM.

‚ÄÚSHE‚ÄÔS GUESSED SOMEHOW DURING THIS NIGHT THAT I DON‚ÄÔT LOVE HER ‚Ä¶ WHICH SHE KNEW ALL ALONG, INDEED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT DON‚ÄÔT YOU LOVE HER?‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WITH AN EXPRESSION OF EXTREME SURPRISE. ‚ÄÚIF SO, WHY DID YOU KEEP HER WHEN SHE CAME TO YOU YESTERDAY, INSTEAD OF TELLING HER PLAINLY LIKE AN HONOURABLE MAN THAT YOU DIDN‚ÄÔT CARE FOR HER? THAT WAS HORRIBLY SHABBY ON YOUR PART; AND HOW MEAN YOU MAKE ME LOOK IN HER EYES!‚ÄÙ

STAVROGIN SUDDENLY LAUGHED.

‚ÄÚI AM LAUGHING AT MY MONKEY,‚ÄÙ HE EXPLAINED AT ONCE.

‚ÄÚAH! YOU SAW THAT I WAS PUTTING IT ON!‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, LAUGHING TOO, WITH GREAT ENJOYMENT. ‚ÄÚI DID IT TO AMUSE YOU! ONLY FANCY, AS SOON AS YOU CAME OUT TO ME I GUESSED FROM YOUR FACE THAT YOU‚ÄÔD BEEN ‚ÄÒUNLUCKY.‚ÄÔ A COMPLETE FIASCO, PERHAPS. EH? THERE! I‚ÄÔLL BET ANYTHING,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, ALMOST GASPING WITH DELIGHT, ‚ÄÚTHAT YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN SITTING SIDE BY SIDE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM ALL NIGHT WASTING YOUR PRECIOUS TIME DISCUSSING SOMETHING LOFTY AND ELEVATED.‚Ä¶ THERE, FORGIVE ME, FORGIVE ME; IT‚ÄÔS NOT MY BUSINESS. I FELT SURE YESTERDAY THAT IT WOULD ALL END IN FOOLISHNESS. I BROUGHT HER TO YOU SIMPLY TO AMUSE YOU, AND TO SHOW YOU THAT YOU WOULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE A DULL TIME WITH ME. I SHALL BE OF USE TO YOU A HUNDRED TIMES IN THAT WAY. I ALWAYS LIKE PLEASING PEOPLE. IF YOU DON‚ÄÔT WANT HER NOW, WHICH WAS WHAT I WAS RECKONING ON WHEN I CAME, THEN ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSO YOU BROUGHT HER SIMPLY FOR MY AMUSEMENT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, WHAT ELSE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOT TO MAKE ME KILL MY WIFE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCOME. YOU‚ÄÔVE NOT KILLED HER? WHAT A TRAGIC FELLOW YOU ARE!

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS JUST THE SAME; YOU KILLED HER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DIDN‚ÄÔT KILL HER! I TELL YOU I HAD NO HAND IN IT.‚Ä¶ YOU ARE BEGINNING TO MAKE ME UNEASY, THOUGH.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGO ON. YOU SAID, ‚ÄÒIF YOU DON‚ÄÔT WANT HER NOW, THEN ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄÒ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEN, LEAVE IT TO ME, OF COURSE. I CAN QUITE EASILY MARRY HER OFF TO MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, THOUGH I DIDN‚ÄÔT MAKE HIM SIT DOWN BY THE FENCE. DON‚ÄÔT TAKE THAT NOTION INTO YOUR HEAD. I AM AFRAID OF HIM, NOW. YOU TALK ABOUT MY DROSHKY, BUT I SIMPLY DASHED BY.‚Ä¶ WHAT IF HE HAS A REVOLVER? IT‚ÄÔS A GOOD THING I BROUGHT MINE. HERE IT IS.‚ÄÙ HE BROUGHT A REVOLVER OUT OF HIS POCKET, SHOWED IT, AND HID IT AGAIN AT ONCE. ‚ÄÚI TOOK IT AS I WAS COMING SUCH A LONG WAY.‚Ä¶ BUT I‚ÄÔLL ARRANGE ALL THAT FOR YOU IN A TWINKLING: HER LITTLE HEART IS ACHING AT THIS MOMENT FOR MAVRIKY; IT SHOULD BE, ANYWAY.‚Ä¶ AND, DO YOU KNOW, I AM REALLY RATHER SORRY FOR HER? IF I TAKE HER TO MAVRIKY SHE WILL BEGIN ABOUT YOU DIRECTLY; SHE WILL PRAISE YOU TO HIM AND ABUSE HIM TO HIS FACE. YOU KNOW THE HEART OF WOMAN! THERE YOU ARE, LAUGHING AGAIN! I AM AWFULLY GLAD THAT YOU ARE SO CHEERFUL NOW. COME, LET‚ÄÔS GO. I‚ÄÔLL BEGIN WITH MAVRIKY RIGHT AWAY, AND ABOUT THEM ‚Ä¶ THOSE WHO‚ÄÔVE BEEN MURDERED ‚Ä¶ HADN‚ÄÔT WE BETTER KEEP QUIET NOW? SHE‚ÄÔLL HEAR LATER ON, ANYWAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT WILL SHE HEAR? WHO‚ÄÔS BEEN MURDERED? WHAT WERE YOU SAYING ABOUT MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH?‚ÄÙ SAID LIZA, SUDDENLY OPENING THE DOOR.

‚ÄÚAH! YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN LISTENING?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT WERE YOU SAYING JUST NOW ABOUT MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH? HAS HE BEEN MURDERED?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAH! THEN YOU DIDN‚ÄÔT HEAR? DON‚ÄÔT DISTRESS YOURSELF, MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH IS ALIVE AND WELL, AND YOU CAN SATISFY YOURSELF OF IT IN AN INSTANT, FOR HE IS HERE BY THE WAYSIDE, BY THE GARDEN FENCE ‚Ä¶ AND I BELIEVE HE‚ÄÔS BEEN SITTING THERE ALL NIGHT. HE IS DRENCHED THROUGH IN HIS GREATCOAT! HE SAW ME AS I DROVE PAST.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS NOT TRUE. YOU SAID ‚ÄÒMURDERED.‚ÄÔ ‚Ä¶ WHO‚ÄÔS BEEN MURDERED?‚ÄÙ SHE INSISTED WITH AGONISING MISTRUST.

‚ÄÚTHE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED ARE MY WIFE, HER BROTHER LEBYADKIN, AND THEIR SERVANT,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN BROUGHT OUT FIRMLY.

LIZA TREMBLED AND TURNED TERRIBLY PALE.

‚ÄÚA STRANGE BRUTAL OUTRAGE, LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA. A SIMPLE CASE OF ROBBERY,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH RATTLED OFF AT ONCE ‚ÄÚSIMPLY ROBBERY, UNDER COVER OF THE FIRE. THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY FEDKA THE CONVICT, AND IT WAS ALL THAT FOOL LEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS FAULT FOR SHOWING EVERY ONE HIS MONEY.‚Ä¶ I RUSHED HERE WITH THE NEWS ‚Ä¶ IT FELL ON ME LIKE A THUNDERBOLT. STAVROGIN COULD HARDLY STAND WHEN I TOLD HIM. WE WERE DELIBERATING HERE WHETHER TO TELL YOU AT ONCE OR NOT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, IS HE TELLING THE TRUTH?‚ÄÙ LIZA ARTICULATED FAINTLY.

‚ÄÚNO; IT‚ÄÔS FALSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFALSE?‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, STARTING. ‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHEAVENS! I SHALL GO MAD!‚ÄÙ CRIED LIZA.

‚ÄÚDO YOU UNDERSTAND, ANYWAY, THAT HE IS MAD NOW!‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH CRIED AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE. ‚ÄÚAFTER ALL, HIS WIFE HAS JUST BEEN MURDERED. YOU SEE HOW WHITE HE IS.‚Ä¶ WHY, HE HAS BEEN WITH YOU THE WHOLE NIGHT. HE HASN‚ÄÔT LEFT YOUR SIDE A MINUTE. HOW CAN YOU SUSPECT HIM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, TELL ME, AS BEFORE GOD, ARE YOU GUILTY OR NOT, AND I SWEAR I‚ÄÔLL BELIEVE YOUR WORD AS THOUGH IT WERE GOD‚ÄÔS, AND I‚ÄÔLL FOLLOW YOU TO THE END OF THE EARTH. YES, I WILL. I‚ÄÔLL FOLLOW YOU LIKE A DOG.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY ARE YOU TORMENTING HER, YOU FANTASTIC CREATURE?‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH IN EXASPERATION. ‚ÄÚLIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA, UPON MY OATH, YOU CAN CRUSH ME INTO POWDER, BUT HE IS NOT GUILTY. ON THE CONTRARY, IT HAS CRUSHED HIM, AND HE IS RAVING, YOU SEE THAT. HE IS NOT TO BLAME IN ANY WAY, NOT IN ANY WAY, NOT EVEN IN THOUGHT!‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS ALL THE WORK OF ROBBERS WHO WILL PROBABLY BE FOUND WITHIN A WEEK AND FLOGGED.‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS ALL THE WORK OF FEDKA THE CONVICT, AND SOME SHPIGULIN MEN, ALL THE TOWN IS AGOG WITH IT. THAT‚ÄÔS WHY I SAY SO TOO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIS THAT RIGHT? IS THAT RIGHT?‚ÄÙ LIZA WAITED TREMBLING FOR HER FINAL SENTENCE.

‚ÄÚI DID NOT KILL THEM, AND I WAS AGAINST IT, BUT I KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO BE KILLED AND I DID NOT STOP THE MURDERERS. LEAVE ME, LIZA,‚ÄÙ STAVROGIN BROUGHT OUT, AND HE WALKED INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM.

LIZA HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS AND WALKED OUT OF THE HOUSE. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS RUSHING AFTER HER, BUT AT ONCE HURRIED BACK AND WENT INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM.

‚ÄÚSO THAT‚ÄÔS YOUR LINE? THAT‚ÄÔS YOUR LINE? SO THERE‚ÄÔS NOTHING YOU ARE AFRAID OF?‚ÄÙ HE FLEW AT STAVROGIN IN AN ABSOLUTE FURY, MUTTERING INCOHERENTLY, SCARCELY ABLE TO FIND WORDS AND FOAMING AT THE MOUTH.

STAVROGIN STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND DID NOT ANSWER A WORD. HE CLUTCHED A LOCK OF HIS HAIR IN HIS LEFT HAND AND SMILED HELPLESSLY. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH PULLED HIM VIOLENTLY BY THE SLEEVE.

‚ÄÚIS IT ALL OVER WITH YOU? SO THAT‚ÄÔS THE LINE YOU ARE TAKING? YOU‚ÄÔLL INFORM AGAINST ALL OF US, AND GO TO A MONASTERY YOURSELF, OR TO THE DEVIL.‚Ä¶ BUT I‚ÄÔLL DO FOR YOU, THOUGH YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF ME!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAH! THAT‚ÄÔS YOU CHATTERING!‚ÄÙ SAID STAVROGIN, NOTICING HIM AT LAST. ‚ÄÚRUN,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, COMING TO HIMSELF SUDDENLY, ‚ÄÚRUN AFTER HER, ORDER THE CARRIAGE, DON‚ÄÔT LEAVE HER.‚Ä¶ RUN, RUN! TAKE HER HOME SO THAT NO ONE MAY KNOW ‚Ä¶ AND THAT SHE MAYN‚ÄÔT GO THERE ‚Ä¶ TO THE BODIES ‚Ä¶ TO THE BODIES.‚Ä¶ FORCE HER TO GET INTO THE CARRIAGE ‚Ä¶ ALEXEY YEGORYTCH! ALEXEY YEGORYTCH!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSTAY, DON‚ÄÔT SHOUT! BY NOW SHE IS IN MAVRIKY‚ÄÔS ARMS.‚Ä¶ MAVRIKY WON‚ÄÔT PUT HER INTO YOUR CARRIAGE.‚Ä¶ STAY! THERE‚ÄÔS SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE CARRIAGE!‚ÄÙ

HE SEIZED HIS REVOLVER AGAIN. STAVROGIN LOOKED AT HIM GRAVELY.

‚ÄÚVERY WELL, KILL ME,‚ÄÙ HE SAID SOFTLY, ALMOST CONCILIATORILY.

‚ÄÚFOO. DAMN IT! WHAT A MAZE OF FALSE SENTIMENT A MAN CAN GET INTO!‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, SHAKING WITH RAGE. ‚ÄÚYES, REALLY, YOU OUGHT TO BE KILLED! SHE OUGHT SIMPLY TO SPIT AT YOU! FINE SORT OF ‚ÄÒMAGIC BOAT,‚ÄÔ YOU ARE; YOU ARE A BROKEN-DOWN, LEAKY OLD HULK!‚Ä¶ YOU OUGHT TO PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER IF ONLY FROM SPITE! ECH! WHY, WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD IT MAKE TO YOU SINCE YOU ASK FOR A BULLET THROUGH YOUR BRAINS YOURSELF?‚ÄÙ

STAVROGIN SMILED STRANGELY.

‚ÄÚIF YOU WERE NOT SUCH A BUFFOON I MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE SAID YES NOW.‚Ä¶ IF YOU HAD ONLY A GRAIN OF SENSE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM A BUFFOON, BUT I DON‚ÄÔT WANT YOU, MY BETTER HALF, TO BE ONE! DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?‚ÄÙ

STAVROGIN DID UNDERSTAND, THOUGH PERHAPS NO ONE ELSE DID. SHATOV, FOR INSTANCE, WAS ASTONISHED WHEN STAVROGIN TOLD HIM THAT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD ENTHUSIASM.

‚ÄÚGO TO THE DEVIL NOW, AND TO-MORROW PERHAPS I MAY WRING SOMETHING OUT OF MYSELF. COME TO-MORROW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES? YES?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW CAN I TELL?‚Ä¶ GO TO HELL. GO TO HELL.‚ÄÙ AND HE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM.

‚ÄÚPERHAPS, AFTER ALL, IT MAY BE FOR THE BEST,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH MUTTERED TO HIMSELF AS HE HID THE REVOLVER.

III

HE RUSHED OFF TO OVERTAKE LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA. SHE HAD NOT GOT FAR AWAY, ONLY A FEW STEPS, FROM THE HOUSE. SHE HAD BEEN DETAINED BY ALEXEY YEGORYTCH, WHO WAS FOLLOWING A STEP BEHIND HER, IN A TAIL COAT, AND WITHOUT A HAT; HIS HEAD WAS BOWED RESPECTFULLY. HE WAS PERSISTENTLY ENTREATING HER TO WAIT FOR A CARRIAGE; THE OLD MAN WAS ALARMED AND ALMOST IN TEARS.

‚ÄÚGO ALONG. YOUR MASTER IS ASKING FOR TEA, AND THERE‚ÄÔS NO ONE TO GIVE IT TO HIM,‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, PUSHING HIM AWAY. HE TOOK LIZA‚ÄÔS ARM.

SHE DID NOT PULL HER ARM AWAY, BUT SHE SEEMED HARDLY TO KNOW WHAT SHE WAS DOING; SHE WAS STILL DAZED.

‚ÄÚTO BEGIN WITH, YOU ARE GOING THE WRONG WAY,‚ÄÙ BABBLED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. ‚ÄÚWE OUGHT TO GO THIS WAY, AND NOT BY THE GARDEN, AND, SECONDLY, WALKING IS IMPOSSIBLE IN ANY CASE. IT‚ÄÔS OVER TWO MILES, AND YOU ARE NOT PROPERLY DRESSED. IF YOU WOULD WAIT A SECOND, I CAME IN A DROSHKY; THE HORSE IS IN THE YARD. I‚ÄÔLL GET IT INSTANTLY, PUT YOU IN, AND GET YOU HOME SO THAT NO ONE SEES YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW KIND YOU ARE,‚ÄÙ SAID LIZA GRACIOUSLY.

‚ÄÚOH, NOT AT ALL. ANY HUMANE MAN IN MY POSITION WOULD DO THE SAME.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

LIZA LOOKED AT HIM, AND WAS SURPRISED.

‚ÄÚGOOD HEAVENS! WHY I THOUGHT IT WAS THAT OLD MAN HERE STILL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLISTEN. I AM AWFULLY GLAD THAT YOU TAKE IT LIKE THIS, BECAUSE IT‚ÄÔS ALL SUCH A FRIGHTFULLY STUPID CONVENTION, AND SINCE IT‚ÄÔS COME TO THAT, HADN‚ÄÔT I BETTER TELL THE OLD MAN TO GET THE CARRIAGE AT ONCE. IT‚ÄÔS ONLY A MATTER OF TEN MINUTES AND WE‚ÄÔLL TURN BACK AND WAIT IN THE PORCH, EH?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WANT FIRST ‚Ä¶ WHERE ARE THOSE MURDERED PEOPLE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAH! WHAT NEXT? THAT WAS WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF.‚Ä¶ NO, WE‚ÄÔD BETTER LEAVE THOSE WRETCHED CREATURES ALONE; IT‚ÄÔS NO USE YOUR LOOKING AT THEM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. I KNOW THAT HOUSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL? WHAT IF YOU DO KNOW IT? COME; IT‚ÄÔS RAINING, AND THERE‚ÄÔS A FOG. (A NICE JOB THIS SACRED DUTY I‚ÄÔVE TAKEN UPON MYSELF.) LISTEN, LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA! IT‚ÄÔS ONE OF TWO ALTERNATIVES. EITHER YOU COME WITH ME IN THE DROSHKY‚ÄÎIN THAT CASE WAIT HERE, AND DON‚ÄÔT TAKE ANOTHER STEP, FOR IF WE GO ANOTHER TWENTY STEPS WE MUST BE SEEN BY MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH! WHERE? WHERE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, IF YOU WANT TO GO WITH HIM, I‚ÄÔLL TAKE YOU A LITTLE FARTHER, IF YOU LIKE, AND SHOW YOU WHERE HE SITS, BUT I DON‚ÄÔT CARE TO GO UP TO HIM JUST NOW. NO, THANK YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE IS WAITING FOR ME. GOOD GOD!‚ÄÙ SHE SUDDENLY STOPPED, AND A FLUSH OF COLOUR FLOODED HER FACE.

‚ÄÚOH! COME NOW. IF HE IS AN UNCONVENTIONAL MAN! YOU KNOW, LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA, IT‚ÄÔS NONE OF MY BUSINESS. I AM A COMPLETE OUTSIDER, AND YOU KNOW THAT YOURSELF. BUT, STILL, I WISH YOU WELL.‚Ä¶ IF YOUR ‚ÄÒFAIRY BOAT‚ÄÔ HAS FAILED YOU, IF IT HAS TURNED OUT TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN A ROTTEN OLD HULK, ONLY FIT TO BE CHOPPED UP ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAH! THAT‚ÄÔS FINE, THAT‚ÄÔS LOVELY,‚ÄÙ CRIED LIZA.

‚ÄÚLOVELY, AND YET YOUR TEARS ARE FALLING. YOU MUST HAVE SPIRIT. YOU MUST BE AS GOOD AS A MAN IN EVERY WAY. IN OUR AGE, WHEN WOMAN.‚Ä¶ FOO, HANG IT,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS ON THE POINT OF SPITTING. ‚ÄÚAND THE CHIEF POINT IS THAT THERE IS NOTHING TO REGRET. IT MAY ALL TURN OUT FOR THE BEST. MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH IS A MAN.‚Ä¶ IN FACT, HE IS A MAN OF FEELING THOUGH NOT TALKATIVE, BUT THAT‚ÄÔS A GOOD THING, TOO, AS LONG AS HE HAS NO CONVENTIONAL NOTIONS, OF COURSE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLOVELY, LOVELY!‚ÄÙ LIZA LAUGHED HYSTERICALLY.

‚ÄÚWELL, HANG IT ALL ‚Ä¶ LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA,‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SUDDENLY PIQUED. ‚ÄÚI AM SIMPLY HERE ON YOUR ACCOUNT.‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS NOTHING TO ME.‚Ä¶ I HELPED YOU YESTERDAY WHEN YOU WANTED IT YOURSELF. TO-DAY ‚Ä¶ WELL, YOU CAN SEE MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH FROM HERE; THERE HE‚ÄÔS SITTING; HE DOESN‚ÄÔT SEE US. I SAY, LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA, HAVE YOU EVER READ ‚ÄÒPOLENKA SAXE‚ÄÔ?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS THE NAME OF A NOVEL, ‚ÄÒPOLENKA SAXE.‚ÄÔ I READ IT WHEN I WAS A STUDENT.‚Ä¶ IN IT A VERY WEALTHY OFFICIAL OF SOME SORT, SAXE, ARRESTED HIS WIFE AT A SUMMER VILLA FOR INFIDELITY.‚Ä¶ BUT, HANG IT; IT‚ÄÔS NO CONSEQUENCE! YOU‚ÄÔLL SEE, MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH WILL MAKE YOU AN OFFER BEFORE YOU GET HOME. HE DOESN‚ÄÔT SEE US YET.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚACH! DON‚ÄÔT LET HIM SEE US!‚ÄÙ LIZA CRIED SUDDENLY, LIKE A MAD CREATURE. ‚ÄÚCOME AWAY, COME AWAY! TO THE WOODS, TO THE FIELDS!‚ÄÙ

AND SHE RAN BACK.

‚ÄÚLIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA, THIS IS SUCH COWARDICE,‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, RUNNING AFTER HER. ‚ÄÚAND WHY DON‚ÄÔT YOU WANT HIM TO SEE YOU? ON THE CONTRARY, YOU MUST LOOK HIM STRAIGHT IN THE FACE, WITH PRIDE.‚Ä¶ IF IT‚ÄÔS SOME FEELING ABOUT THAT ‚Ä¶ SOME MAIDENLY ‚Ä¶ THAT‚ÄÔS SUCH A PREJUDICE, SO OUT OF DATE ‚Ä¶ BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING? WHERE ARE YOU GOING? ECH! SHE IS RUNNING! BETTER GO BACK TO STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS AND TAKE MY DROSHKY.‚Ä¶ WHERE ARE YOU GOING? THAT‚ÄÔS THE WAY TO THE FIELDS! THERE! SHE‚ÄÔS FALLEN DOWN!‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

HE STOPPED. LIZA WAS FLYING ALONG LIKE A BIRD, NOT CONSCIOUS WHERE SHE WAS GOING, AND PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS ALREADY FIFTY PACES BEHIND HER. SHE STUMBLED OVER A MOUND OF EARTH AND FELL DOWN. AT THE SAME MOMENT THERE WAS THE SOUND OF A TERRIBLE SHOUT FROM BEHIND. IT CAME FROM MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, WHO HAD SEEN HER FLIGHT AND HER FALL, AND WAS RUNNING TO HER ACROSS THE FIELD. IN A FLASH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD RETIRED INTO STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS GATEWAY TO MAKE HASTE AND GET INTO HIS DROSHKY.

MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH WAS ALREADY STANDING IN TERRIBLE ALARM BY LIZA, WHO HAD RISEN TO HER FEET; HE WAS BENDING OVER HER AND HOLDING HER HANDS IN BOTH OF HIS. ALL THE INCREDIBLE SURROUNDINGS OF THIS MEETING OVERWHELMED HIM, AND TEARS WERE ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS. HE SAW THE WOMAN FOR WHOM HE HAD SUCH REVERENT DEVOTION RUNNING MADLY ACROSS THE FIELDS, AT SUCH AN HOUR, IN SUCH WEATHER, WITH NOTHING OVER HER DRESS, THE GAY DRESS SHE WORE THE DAY BEFORE NOW CRUMPLED AND MUDDY FROM HER FALL.‚Ä¶ HE COULD NOT UTTER A WORD; HE TOOK OFF HIS GREATCOAT, AND WITH TREMBLING HANDS PUT IT ROUND HER SHOULDERS. SUDDENLY HE UTTERED A CRY, FEELING THAT SHE HAD PRESSED HER LIPS TO HIS HAND.

‚ÄÚLIZA,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, ‚ÄÚI AM NO GOOD FOR ANYTHING, BUT DON‚ÄÔT DRIVE ME AWAY FROM YOU!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, NO! LET US MAKE HASTE AWAY FROM HERE. DON‚ÄÔT LEAVE ME!‚ÄÙ AND, SEIZING HIS HAND, SHE DREW HIM AFTER HER. ‚ÄÚMAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH,‚ÄÙ SHE SUDDENLY DROPPED HER VOICE TIMIDLY, ‚ÄÚI KEPT A BOLD FACE THERE ALL THE TIME, BUT NOW I AM AFRAID OF DEATH. I SHALL DIE SOON, VERY SOON, BUT I AM AFRAID, I AM AFRAID TO DIE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ SHE WHISPERED, PRESSING HIS HAND TIGHT.

‚ÄÚOH, IF THERE WERE SOMEONE,‚ÄÙ HE LOOKED ROUND IN DESPAIR. ‚ÄÚSOME PASSER-BY! YOU WILL GET YOUR FEET WET, YOU ‚Ä¶ WILL LOSE YOUR REASON!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS ALL RIGHT; IT‚ÄÔS ALL RIGHT,‚ÄÙ SHE TRIED TO REASSURE HIM. ‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS RIGHT. I AM NOT SO FRIGHTENED WITH YOU. HOLD MY HAND, LEAD ME.‚Ä¶ WHERE ARE WE GOING NOW? HOME? NO! I WANT FIRST TO SEE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED. HIS WIFE HAS BEEN MURDERED THEY SAY, AND HE SAYS HE KILLED HER HIMSELF. BUT THAT‚ÄÔS NOT TRUE, IS IT? I WANT TO SEE FOR MYSELF THOSE THREE WHO‚ÄÔVE BEEN KILLED ‚Ä¶ ON MY ACCOUNT ‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS BECAUSE OF THEM HIS LOVE FOR ME HAS GROWN COLD SINCE LAST NIGHT.‚Ä¶ I SHALL SEE AND FIND OUT EVERYTHING. MAKE HASTE, MAKE HASTE, I KNOW THE HOUSE ‚Ä¶ THERE‚ÄÔS A FIRE THERE.‚Ä¶ MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, MY DEAR ONE, DON‚ÄÔT FORGIVE ME IN MY SHAME! WHY FORGIVE ME? WHY ARE YOU CRYING? GIVE ME A BLOW AND KILL ME HERE IN THE FIELD, LIKE A DOG!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO ONE IS YOUR JUDGE NOW,‚ÄÙ MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH PRONOUNCED FIRMLY. ‚ÄÚGOD FORGIVE YOU. I LEAST OF ALL CAN BE YOUR JUDGE.‚ÄÙ

BUT IT WOULD BE STRANGE TO DESCRIBE THEIR CONVERSATION. AND MEANWHILE THEY WALKED HAND IN HAND QUICKLY, HURRYING AS THOUGH THEY WERE CRAZY. THEY WERE GOING STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE FIRE. MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH STILL HAD HOPES OF MEETING A CART AT LEAST, BUT NO ONE CAME THAT WAY. A MIST OF FINE, DRIZZLING RAIN ENVELOPED THE WHOLE COUNTRY, SWALLOWING UP EVERY RAY OF LIGHT, EVERY GLEAM OF COLOUR, AND TRANSFORMING EVERYTHING INTO ONE SMOKY, LEADEN, INDISTINGUISHABLE MASS. IT HAD LONG BEEN DAYLIGHT, YET IT SEEMED AS THOUGH IT WERE STILL NIGHT. AND SUDDENLY IN THIS COLD FOGGY MIST THERE APPEARED COMING TOWARDS THEM A STRANGE AND ABSURD FIGURE. PICTURING IT NOW I THINK I SHOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED MY EYES IF I HAD BEEN IN LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA‚ÄÔS PLACE, YET SHE UTTERED A CRY OF JOY, AND RECOGNISED THE APPROACHING FIGURE AT ONCE. IT WAS STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. HOW HE HAD GONE OFF, HOW THE INSANE, IMPRACTICABLE IDEA OF HIS FLIGHT CAME TO BE CARRIED OUT, OF THAT LATER. I WILL ONLY MENTION THAT HE WAS IN A FEVER THAT MORNING, YET EVEN ILLNESS DID NOT PREVENT HIS STARTING. HE WAS WALKING RESOLUTELY ON THE DAMP GROUND. IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HAD PLANNED THE ENTERPRISE TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY, ALONE WITH HIS INEXPERIENCE AND LACK OF PRACTICAL SENSE. HE WORE ‚ÄÚTRAVELLING DRESS,‚ÄÙ THAT IS, A GREATCOAT WITH A WIDE PATENT-LEATHER BELT, FASTENED WITH A BUCKLE AND A PAIR OF NEW HIGH BOOTS PULLED OVER HIS TROUSERS. PROBABLY HE HAD FOR SOME TIME PAST PICTURED A TRAVELLER AS LOOKING LIKE THIS, AND THE BELT AND THE HIGH BOOTS WITH THE SHINING TOPS LIKE A HUSSAR‚ÄÔS, IN WHICH HE COULD HARDLY WALK, HAD BEEN READY SOME TIME BEFORE. A BROAD-BRIMMED HAT, A KNITTED SCARF, TWISTED CLOSE ROUND HIS NECK, A STICK IN HIS RIGHT HAND, AND AN EXCEEDINGLY SMALL BUT EXTREMELY TIGHTLY PACKED BAG IN HIS LEFT, COMPLETED HIS GET-UP. HE HAD, BESIDES, IN THE SAME RIGHT HAND, AN OPEN UMBRELLA. THESE THREE OBJECTS‚ÄÎTHE UMBRELLA, THE STICK, AND THE BAG‚ÄÎHAD BEEN VERY AWKWARD TO CARRY FOR THE FIRST MILE, AND HAD BEGUN TO BE HEAVY BY THE SECOND.

‚ÄÚCAN IT REALLY BE YOU?‚ÄÙ CRIED LIZA, LOOKING AT HIM WITH DISTRESSED WONDER, AFTER HER FIRST RUSH OF INSTINCTIVE GLADNESS.

‚ÄÚLISE,‚ÄÙ CRIED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, RUSHING TO HER ALMOST IN DELIRIUM TOO. ‚ÄÚCH√®RE, CH√®RE.‚Ä¶ CAN YOU BE OUT, TOO ‚Ä¶ IN SUCH A FOG? YOU SEE THE GLOW OF FIRE. VOUS √™TES MALHEUREUSE, N‚ÄÔEST-CE PAS? I SEE, I SEE. DON‚ÄÔT TELL ME, BUT DON‚ÄÔT QUESTION ME EITHER. NOUS SOMMES TOUS MALHEUREUX MAIS IL FAUT LES PARDONNER TOUS. PARDONNONS, LISE, AND LET US BE FREE FOREVER. TO BE QUIT OF THE WORLD AND BE COMPLETELY FREE. IL FAUT PARDONNER, PARDONNER, ET PARDONNER!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT WHY ARE YOU KNEELING DOWN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBECAUSE, TAKING LEAVE OF THE WORLD, I WANT TO TAKE LEAVE OF ALL MY PAST IN YOUR PERSON!‚ÄÙ HE WEPT AND RAISED BOTH HER HANDS TO HIS TEAR-STAINED EYES. ‚ÄÚI KNEEL TO ALL THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL IN MY LIFE. I KISS AND GIVE THANKS! NOW I‚ÄÔVE TORN MYSELF IN HALF; LEFT BEHIND A MAD VISIONARY WHO DREAMED OF SOARING TO THE SKY. VINGT-DEUX ANS, HERE. A SHATTERED, FROZEN OLD MAN. A TUTOR CHEZ CE MARCHAND, S‚ÄÔIL EXISTE POURTANT CE MARCHAND.‚Ä¶ BUT HOW DRENCHED YOU ARE, LISE!‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, JUMPING ON TO HIS FEET, FEELING THAT HIS KNEES TOO WERE SOAKED BY THE WET EARTH. ‚ÄÚAND HOW IS IT POSSIBLE ‚Ä¶ YOU ARE IN SUCH A DRESS ‚Ä¶ AND ON FOOT, AND IN THESE FIELDS?‚Ä¶ YOU ARE CRYING! VOUS √™TES MALHEUREUSE. BAH, I DID HEAR SOMETHING.‚Ä¶ BUT WHERE HAVE YOU COME FROM NOW?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED HURRIED QUESTIONS WITH AN UNEASY AIR, LOOKING IN EXTREME BEWILDERMENT AT MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH. ‚ÄÚMAIS SAVEZ-VOUS L‚ÄÔHEURE QU‚ÄÔIL EST?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSTEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO‚ÄÔVE BEEN MURDERED?‚Ä¶ IS IT TRUE? IS IT TRUE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHESE PEOPLE! I SAW THE GLOW OF THEIR WORK ALL NIGHT. THEY WERE BOUND TO END IN THIS.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HIS EYES FLASHED AGAIN. ‚ÄÚI AM FLEEING AWAY FROM MADNESS, FROM A DELIRIOUS DREAM. I AM FLEEING AWAY TO SEEK FOR RUSSIA. EXISTE-T-ELLE, LA RUSSIE? BAH! C‚ÄÔEST VOUS, CHER CAPITAINE! I‚ÄÔVE NEVER DOUBTED THAT I SHOULD MEET YOU SOMEWHERE ON SOME HIGH ADVENTURE.‚Ä¶ BUT TAKE MY UMBRELLA, AND‚ÄÎWHY MUST YOU BE ON FOOT? FOR GOD‚ÄÔS SAKE, DO AT LEAST TAKE MY UMBRELLA, FOR I SHALL HIRE A CARRIAGE SOMEWHERE IN ANY CASE. I AM ON FOOT BECAUSE STASIE (I MEAN, NASTASYA) WOULD HAVE SHOUTED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE WHOLE STREET IF SHE‚ÄÔD FOUND OUT I WAS GOING AWAY. SO I SLIPPED AWAY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE INCOGNITO. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW; IN THE VOICE THEY WRITE OF THERE BEING BRIGANDS EVERYWHERE, BUT I THOUGHT SURELY I SHOULDN‚ÄÔT MEET A BRIGAND THE MOMENT I CAME OUT ON THE ROAD. CH√®RE LISE, I THOUGHT YOU SAID SOMETHING OF SOMEONE‚ÄÔS BEING MURDERED. OH, MON DIEU! YOU ARE ILL!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCOME ALONG, COME ALONG!‚ÄÙ CRIED LIZA, ALMOST IN HYSTERICS, DRAWING MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH AFTER HER AGAIN. ‚ÄÚWAIT A MINUTE, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH!‚ÄÙ SHE CAME BACK SUDDENLY TO HIM. ‚ÄÚSTAY, POOR DARLING, LET ME SIGN YOU WITH THE CROSS. PERHAPS, IT WOULD BE BETTER TO PUT YOU UNDER CONTROL, BUT I‚ÄÔD RATHER MAKE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER YOU. YOU, TOO, PRAY FOR ‚ÄÒPOOR‚ÄÔ LIZA‚ÄÎJUST A LITTLE, DON‚ÄÔT BOTHER TOO MUCH ABOUT IT. MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, GIVE THAT BABY BACK HIS UMBRELLA. YOU MUST GIVE IT HIM. THAT‚ÄÔS RIGHT.‚Ä¶ COME, LET US GO, LET US GO!‚ÄÙ

THEY REACHED THE FATAL HOUSE AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THE HUGE CROWD, WHICH HAD GATHERED ROUND IT, HAD ALREADY HEARD A GOOD DEAL OF STAVROGIN, AND OF HOW MUCH IT WAS TO HIS INTEREST TO MURDER HIS WIFE. YET, I REPEAT, THE IMMENSE MAJORITY WENT ON LISTENING WITHOUT MOVING OR UTTERING A WORD. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO WERE EXCITED WERE BAWLING DRUNKARDS AND EXCITABLE INDIVIDUALS OF THE SAME SORT AS THE GESTICULATORY CABINET-MAKER. EVERY ONE KNEW THE LATTER AS A MAN REALLY OF MILD DISPOSITION, BUT HE WAS LIABLE ON OCCASION TO GET EXCITED AND TO FLY OFF AT A TANGENT IF ANYTHING STRUCK HIM IN A CERTAIN WAY. I DID NOT SEE LIZA AND MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH ARRIVE. PETRIFIED WITH AMAZEMENT, I FIRST NOTICED LIZA SOME DISTANCE AWAY IN THE CROWD, AND I DID NOT AT ONCE CATCH SIGHT OF MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH. I FANCY THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN HE FELL TWO OR THREE STEPS BEHIND HER OR WAS PRESSED BACK BY THE CRUSH. LIZA, FORCING HER WAY THROUGH THE CROWD, SEEING AND NOTICING NOTHING ROUND HER, LIKE ONE IN A DELIRIUM, LIKE A PATIENT ESCAPED FROM A HOSPITAL, ATTRACTED ATTENTION ONLY TOO QUICKLY, OF COURSE. THERE AROSE A HUBBUB OF LOUD TALKING AND AT LAST SUDDEN SHOUTS. SOME ONE BAWLED OUT, ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS WOMAN!‚ÄÙ AND ON THE OTHER SIDE, ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS NOT ENOUGH TO MURDER THEM, SHE WANTS TO LOOK AT THEM!‚ÄÙ ALL AT ONCE I SAW AN ARM RAISED ABOVE HER HEAD FROM BEHIND AND SUDDENLY BROUGHT DOWN UPON IT. LIZA FELL TO THE GROUND. WE HEARD A FEARFUL SCREAM FROM MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH AS HE DASHED TO HER ASSISTANCE AND STRUCK WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH THE MAN WHO STOOD BETWEEN HIM AND LIZA. BUT AT THAT INSTANT THE SAME CABINETMAKER SEIZED HIM WITH BOTH ARMS FROM BEHIND. FOR SOME MINUTES NOTHING COULD BE DISTINGUISHED IN THE SCRIMMAGE THAT FOLLOWED. I BELIEVE LIZA GOT UP BUT WAS KNOCKED DOWN BY ANOTHER BLOW. SUDDENLY THE CROWD PARTED AND A SMALL SPACE WAS LEFT EMPTY ROUND LIZA‚ÄÔS PROSTRATE FIGURE, AND MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH, FRANTIC WITH GRIEF AND COVERED WITH BLOOD, WAS STANDING OVER HER, SCREAMING, WEEPING, AND WRINGING HIS HANDS. I DON‚ÄÔT REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT FOLLOWED AFTER; I ONLY REMEMBER THAT THEY BEGAN TO CARRY LIZA AWAY. I RAN AFTER HER. SHE WAS STILL ALIVE AND PERHAPS STILL CONSCIOUS. THE CABINET-MAKER AND THREE OTHER MEN IN THE CROWD WERE SEIZED. THESE THREE STILL DENY HAVING TAKEN ANY PART IN THE DASTARDLY DEED, STUBBORNLY MAINTAINING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ARRESTED BY MISTAKE. PERHAPS IT‚ÄÔS THE TRUTH. THOUGH THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THE CABINET-MAKER IS CLEAR, HE IS SO IRRATIONAL THAT HE IS STILL UNABLE TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED COHERENTLY. I TOO, AS A SPECTATOR, THOUGH AT SOME DISTANCE, HAD TO GIVE EVIDENCE AT THE INQUEST. I DECLARED THAT IT HAD ALL HAPPENED ENTIRELY ACCIDENTALLY THROUGH THE ACTION OF MEN PERHAPS MOVED BY ILL-FEELING, YET SCARCELY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING‚ÄÎDRUNK AND IRRESPONSIBLE. I AM OF THAT OPINION TO THIS DAY.





CHAPTER IV. THE LAST RESOLUTION

I

THAT MORNING MANY PEOPLE SAW PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. ALL WHO SAW HIM REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS IN A PARTICULARLY EXCITED STATE. AT TWO O‚ÄÔCLOCK HE WENT TO SEE GAGANOV, WHO HAD ARRIVED FROM THE COUNTRY ONLY THE DAY BEFORE, AND WHOSE HOUSE WAS FULL OF VISITORS HOTLY DISCUSSING THE EVENTS OF THE PREVIOUS DAY. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH TALKED MORE THAN ANYONE AND MADE THEM LISTEN TO HIM. HE WAS ALWAYS CONSIDERED AMONG US AS A ‚ÄÚCHATTERBOX OF A STUDENT WITH A SCREW LOOSE,‚ÄÙ BUT NOW HE TALKED OF YULIA MIHAILOVNA, AND IN THE GENERAL EXCITEMENT THE THEME WAS AN ENTHRALLING ONE. AS ONE WHO HAD RECENTLY BEEN HER INTIMATE AND CONFIDENTIAL FRIEND, HE DISCLOSED MANY NEW AND UNEXPECTED DETAILS CONCERNING HER; INCIDENTALLY (AND OF COURSE UNGUARDEDLY) HE REPEATED SOME OF HER OWN REMARKS ABOUT PERSONS KNOWN TO ALL IN THE TOWN, AND THEREBY PIQUED THEIR VANITY. HE DROPPED IT ALL IN A VAGUE AND RAMBLING WAY, LIKE A MAN FREE FROM GUILE DRIVEN BY HIS SENSE OF HONOUR TO THE PAINFUL NECESSITY OF CLEARING UP A PERFECT MOUNTAIN OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS, AND SO SIMPLE-HEARTED THAT HE HARDLY KNEW WHERE TO BEGIN AND WHERE TO LEAVE OFF. HE LET SLIP IN A RATHER UNGUARDED WAY, TOO, THAT YULIA MIHAILOVNA KNEW THE WHOLE SECRET OF STAVROGIN AND THAT SHE HAD BEEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WHOLE INTRIGUE. SHE HAD TAKEN HIM IN TOO, FOR HE, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, HAD ALSO BEEN IN LOVE WITH THIS UNHAPPY LIZA, YET HE HAD BEEN SO HOODWINKED THAT HE HAD ALMOST TAKEN HER TO STAVROGIN HIMSELF IN THE CARRIAGE. ‚ÄÚYES, YES, IT‚ÄÔS ALL VERY WELL FOR YOU TO LAUGH, GENTLEMEN, BUT IF ONLY I‚ÄÔD KNOWN, IF I‚ÄÔD KNOWN HOW IT WOULD END!‚ÄÙ HE CONCLUDED. TO VARIOUS EXCITED INQUIRIES ABOUT STAVROGIN HE BLUNTLY REPLIED THAT IN HIS OPINION THE CATASTROPHE TO THE LEBYADKINS WAS A PURE COINCIDENCE, AND THAT IT WAS ALL LEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS OWN FAULT FOR DISPLAYING HIS MONEY. HE EXPLAINED THIS PARTICULARLY WELL. ONE OF HIS LISTENERS OBSERVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD HIS ‚ÄÚPRETENDING‚ÄÙ; THAT HE HAD EATEN AND DRUNK AND ALMOST SLEPT AT YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS, YET NOW HE WAS THE FIRST TO BLACKEN HER CHARACTER, AND THAT THIS WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A FINE THING TO DO AS HE SUPPOSED. BUT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH IMMEDIATELY DEFENDED HIMSELF.

‚ÄÚI ATE AND DRANK THERE NOT BECAUSE I HAD NO MONEY, AND IT‚ÄÔS NOT MY FAULT THAT I WAS INVITED THERE. ALLOW ME TO JUDGE FOR MYSELF HOW FAR I NEED TO BE GRATEFUL FOR THAT.‚ÄÙ

THE GENERAL IMPRESSION WAS IN HIS FAVOUR. ‚ÄÚHE MAY BE RATHER ABSURD, AND OF COURSE HE IS A NONSENSICAL FELLOW, YET STILL HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS FOOLISHNESS. ON THE CONTRARY, IT APPEARS THAT HE TRIED TO STOP HER.‚ÄÙ

ABOUT TWO O‚ÄÔCLOCK THE NEWS SUDDENLY CAME THAT STAVROGIN, ABOUT WHOM THERE WAS SO MUCH TALK, HAD SUDDENLY LEFT FOR PETERSBURG BY THE MIDDAY TRAIN. THIS INTERESTED PEOPLE IMMENSELY; MANY OF THEM FROWNED. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS SO MUCH STRUCK THAT I WAS TOLD HE TURNED QUITE PALE AND CRIED OUT STRANGELY, ‚ÄÚWHY, HOW COULD THEY HAVE LET HIM GO?‚ÄÙ HE HURRIED AWAY FROM GAGANOV‚ÄÔS FORTHWITH, YET HE WAS SEEN IN TWO OR THREE OTHER HOUSES.

TOWARDS DUSK HE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING IN TO SEE YULIA MIHAILOVNA THOUGH HE HAD THE GREATEST PAINS TO DO SO, AS SHE HAD ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO SEE HIM. I HEARD OF THIS FROM THE LADY HERSELF ONLY THREE WEEKS AFTERWARDS, JUST BEFORE HER DEPARTURE FOR PETERSBURG. SHE GAVE ME NO DETAILS, BUT OBSERVED WITH A SHUDDER THAT ‚ÄÚHE HAD ON THAT OCCASION ASTOUNDED HER BEYOND ALL BELIEF.‚ÄÙ I IMAGINE THAT ALL HE DID WAS TO TERRIFY HER BY THREATENING TO CHARGE HER WITH BEING AN ACCOMPLICE IF SHE ‚ÄÚSAID ANYTHING.‚ÄÙ THE NECESSITY FOR THIS INTIMIDATION AROSE FROM HIS PLANS AT THE MOMENT, OF WHICH SHE, OF COURSE, KNEW NOTHING; AND ONLY LATER, FIVE DAYS AFTERWARDS, SHE GUESSED WHY HE HAD BEEN SO DOUBTFUL OF HER RETICENCE AND SO AFRAID OF A NEW OUTBURST OF INDIGNATION ON HER PART.

BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT O‚ÄÔCLOCK, WHEN IT WAS DARK, ALL THE FIVE MEMBERS OF THE QUINTET MET TOGETHER AT ENSIGN ERKEL‚ÄÔS LODGINGS IN A LITTLE CROOKED HOUSE AT THE END OF THE TOWN. THE MEETING HAD BEEN FIXED BY PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HIMSELF, BUT HE WAS UNPARDONABLY LATE, AND THE MEMBERS WAITED OVER AN HOUR FOR HIM. THIS ENSIGN ERKEL WAS THAT YOUNG OFFICER WHO HAD SAT THE WHOLE EVENING AT VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS WITH A PENCIL IN HIS HAND AND A NOTEBOOK BEFORE HIM. HE HAD NOT LONG BEEN IN THE TOWN; HE LODGED ALONE WITH TWO OLD WOMEN, SISTERS, IN A SECLUDED BY-STREET AND WAS SHORTLY TO LEAVE THE TOWN; A MEETING AT HIS HOUSE WAS LESS LIKELY TO ATTRACT NOTICE THAN ANYWHERE. THIS STRANGE BOY WAS DISTINGUISHED BY EXTREME TACITURNITY: HE WAS CAPABLE OF SITTING FOR A DOZEN EVENINGS IN SUCCESSION IN NOISY COMPANY, WITH THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONVERSATION GOING ON AROUND HIM, WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD, THOUGH HE LISTENED WITH EXTREME ATTENTION, WATCHING THE SPEAKERS WITH HIS CHILDLIKE EYES. HIS FACE WAS VERY PRETTY AND EVEN HAD A CERTAIN LOOK OF CLEVERNESS. HE DID NOT BELONG TO THE QUINTET; IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE HAD SOME SPECIAL JOB OF A PURELY PRACTICAL CHARACTER. IT IS KNOWN NOW THAT HE HAD NOTHING OF THE SORT AND PROBABLY DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS POSITION HIMSELF. IT WAS SIMPLY THAT HE WAS FILLED WITH HERO-WORSHIP FOR PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WHOM HE HAD ONLY LATELY MET. IF HE HAD MET A MONSTER OF INIQUITY WHO HAD INCITED HIM TO FOUND A BAND OF BRIGANDS ON THE PRETEXT OF SOME ROMANTIC AND SOCIALISTIC OBJECT, AND AS A TEST HAD BIDDEN HIM ROB AND MURDER THE FIRST PEASANT HE MET, HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE OBEYED AND DONE IT. HE HAD AN INVALID MOTHER TO WHOM HE SENT HALF OF HIS SCANTY PAY‚ÄÎAND HOW SHE MUST HAVE KISSED THAT POOR LITTLE FLAXEN HEAD, HOW SHE MUST HAVE TREMBLED AND PRAYED OVER IT! I GO INTO THESE DETAILS ABOUT HIM BECAUSE I FEEL VERY SORRY FOR HIM.

‚ÄÚOUR FELLOWS‚ÄÙ WERE EXCITED. THE EVENTS OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT HAD MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION ON THEM, AND I FANCY THEY WERE IN A PANIC. THE SIMPLE DISORDERLINESS IN WHICH THEY HAD SO ZEALOUSLY AND SYSTEMATICALLY TAKEN PART HAD ENDED IN A WAY THEY HAD NOT EXPECTED. THE FIRE IN THE NIGHT, THE MURDER OF THE LEBYADKINS, THE SAVAGE BRUTALITY OF THE CROWD WITH LIZA, HAD BEEN A SERIES OF SURPRISES WHICH THEY HAD NOT ANTICIPATED IN THEIR PROGRAMME. THEY HOTLY ACCUSED THE HAND THAT HAD GUIDED THEM OF DESPOTISM AND DUPLICITY. IN FACT, WHILE THEY WERE WAITING FOR PYOTR STEPANOVITCH THEY WORKED EACH OTHER UP TO SUCH A POINT THAT THEY RESOLVED AGAIN TO ASK HIM FOR A DEFINITE EXPLANATION, AND IF HE EVADED AGAIN, AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE, TO DISSOLVE THE QUINTET AND TO FOUND INSTEAD A NEW SECRET SOCIETY ‚ÄÚFOR THE PROPAGANDA OF IDEAS‚ÄÙ AND ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE ON THE BASIS OF DEMOCRACY AND EQUALITY. LIPUTIN, SHIGALOV, AND THE AUTHORITY ON THE PEASANTRY SUPPORTED THIS PLAN; LYAMSHIN SAID NOTHING, THOUGH HE LOOKED APPROVING. VIRGINSKY HESITATED AND WANTED TO HEAR PYOTR STEPANOVITCH FIRST. IT WAS DECIDED TO HEAR PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, BUT STILL HE DID NOT COME; SUCH CASUALNESS ADDED FUEL TO THE FLAMES. ERKEL WAS ABSOLUTELY SILENT AND DID NOTHING BUT ORDER THE TEA, WHICH HE BROUGHT FROM HIS LANDLADIES IN GLASSES ON A TRAY, NOT BRINGING IN THE SAMOVAR NOR ALLOWING THE SERVANT TO ENTER.

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH DID NOT TURN UP TILL HALF-PAST EIGHT. WITH RAPID STEPS HE WENT UP TO THE CIRCULAR TABLE BEFORE THE SOFA ROUND WHICH THE COMPANY WERE SEATED; HE KEPT HIS CAP IN HIS HAND AND REFUSED TEA. HE LOOKED ANGRY, SEVERE, AND SUPERCILIOUS. HE MUST HAVE OBSERVED AT ONCE FROM THEIR FACES THAT THEY WERE ‚ÄÚMUTINOUS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBEFORE I OPEN MY MOUTH, YOU‚ÄÔVE GOT SOMETHING HIDDEN; OUT WITH IT.‚ÄÙ

LIPUTIN BEGAN ‚ÄÚIN THE NAME OF ALL,‚ÄÙ AND DECLARED IN A VOICE QUIVERING WITH RESENTMENT ‚ÄÚTHAT IF THINGS WERE GOING ON LIKE THAT THEY MIGHT AS WELL BLOW THEIR BRAINS OUT.‚ÄÙ OH, THEY WERE NOT AT ALL AFRAID TO BLOW THEIR BRAINS OUT, THEY WERE QUITE READY TO, IN FACT, BUT ONLY TO SERVE THE COMMON CAUSE (A GENERAL MOVEMENT OF APPROBATION). SO HE MUST BE MORE OPEN WITH THEM SO THAT THEY MIGHT ALWAYS KNOW BEFOREHAND, ‚ÄÚOR ELSE WHAT WOULD THINGS BE COMING TO?‚ÄÙ (AGAIN A STIR AND SOME GUTTURAL SOUNDS.) TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS WAS HUMILIATING AND DANGEROUS. ‚ÄÚWE DON‚ÄÔT SAY SO BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID, BUT IF ONE ACTS AND THE REST ARE ONLY PAWNS, THEN ONE WOULD BLUNDER AND ALL WOULD BE LOST.‚ÄÙ (EXCLAMATIONS. ‚ÄÚYES, YES.‚ÄÙ GENERAL APPROVAL.)

‚ÄÚDAMN IT ALL, WHAT DO YOU WANT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT CONNECTION IS THERE BETWEEN THE COMMON CAUSE AND THE PETTY INTRIGUES OF MR. STAVROGIN?‚ÄÙ CRIED LIPUTIN, BOILING OVER. ‚ÄÚSUPPOSE HE IS IN SOME MYSTERIOUS RELATION TO THE CENTRE, IF THAT LEGENDARY CENTRE REALLY EXISTS AT ALL, IT‚ÄÔS NO CONCERN OF OURS. AND MEANTIME A MURDER HAS BEEN COMMITTED, THE POLICE HAVE BEEN ROUSED; IF THEY FOLLOW THE THREAD THEY MAY FIND WHAT IT STARTS FROM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF STAVROGIN AND YOU ARE CAUGHT, WE SHALL BE CAUGHT TOO,‚ÄÙ ADDED THE AUTHORITY ON THE PEASANTRY.

‚ÄÚAND TO NO GOOD PURPOSE FOR THE COMMON CAUSE,‚ÄÙ VIRGINSKY CONCLUDED DESPONDENTLY.

‚ÄÚWHAT NONSENSE! THE MURDER IS A CHANCE CRIME; IT WAS COMMITTED BY FEDKA FOR THE SAKE OF ROBBERY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚH‚ÄÔM! STRANGE COINCIDENCE, THOUGH,‚ÄÙ SAID LIPUTIN, WRIGGLING.

‚ÄÚAND IF YOU WILL HAVE IT, IT‚ÄÔS ALL THROUGH YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHROUGH US?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIN THE FIRST PLACE, YOU, LIPUTIN, HAD A SHARE IN THE INTRIGUE YOURSELF; AND THE SECOND CHIEF POINT IS, YOU WERE ORDERED TO GET LEBYADKIN AWAY AND GIVEN MONEY TO DO IT; AND WHAT DID YOU DO? IF YOU‚ÄÔD GOT HIM AWAY NOTHING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT WASN‚ÄÔT IT YOU YOURSELF WHO SUGGESTED THE IDEA THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO SET HIM ON TO READ HIS VERSES?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAN IDEA IS NOT A COMMAND. THE COMMAND WAS TO GET HIM AWAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCOMMAND! RATHER A QUEER WORD.‚Ä¶ ON THE CONTRARY, YOUR ORDERS WERE TO DELAY SENDING HIM OFF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU MADE A MISTAKE AND SHOWED YOUR FOOLISHNESS AND SELF-WILL. THE MURDER WAS THE WORK OF FEDKA, AND HE CARRIED IT OUT ALONE FOR THE SAKE OF ROBBERY. YOU HEARD THE GOSSIP AND BELIEVED IT. YOU WERE SCARED. STAVROGIN IS NOT SUCH A FOOL, AND THE PROOF OF THAT IS HE LEFT THE TOWN AT TWELVE O‚ÄÔCLOCK AFTER AN INTERVIEW WITH THE VICE-GOVERNOR; IF THERE WERE ANYTHING IN IT THEY WOULD NOT LET HIM GO TO PETERSBURG IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT WE ARE NOT MAKING OUT THAT MR. STAVROGIN COMMITTED THE MURDER HIMSELF,‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN REJOINED SPITEFULLY AND UNCEREMONIOUSLY. ‚ÄÚHE MAY HAVE KNOWN NOTHING ABOUT IT, LIKE ME; AND YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT, THOUGH I AM MIXED UP IN IT LIKE MUTTON IN A HASH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHOM ARE YOU ACCUSING?‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, LOOKING AT HIM DARKLY.

‚ÄÚTHOSE WHOSE INTEREST IT IS TO BURN DOWN TOWNS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU MAKE MATTERS WORSE BY WRIGGLING OUT OF IT. HOWEVER, WON‚ÄÔT YOU READ THIS AND PASS IT TO THE OTHERS, SIMPLY AS A FACT OF INTEREST?‚ÄÙ

HE PULLED OUT OF HIS POCKET LEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS ANONYMOUS LETTER TO LEMBKE AND HANDED IT TO LIPUTIN. THE LATTER READ IT, WAS EVIDENTLY SURPRISED, AND PASSED IT THOUGHTFULLY TO HIS NEIGHBOUR; THE LETTER QUICKLY WENT THE ROUND.

‚ÄÚIS THAT REALLY LEBYADKIN‚ÄÔS HANDWRITING?‚ÄÙ OBSERVED SHIGALOV.

‚ÄÚIT IS,‚ÄÙ ANSWERED LIPUTIN AND TOLKATCHENKO (THE AUTHORITY ON THE PEASANTRY).

‚ÄÚI SIMPLY BROUGHT IT AS A FACT OF INTEREST AND BECAUSE I KNEW YOU WERE SO SENTIMENTAL OVER LEBYADKIN,‚ÄÙ REPEATED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, TAKING THE LETTER BACK. ‚ÄÚSO IT TURNS OUT, GENTLEMEN, THAT A STRAY FEDKA RELIEVES US QUITE BY CHANCE OF A DANGEROUS MAN. THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT CHANCE DOES SOMETIMES! IT‚ÄÔS INSTRUCTIVE, ISN‚ÄÔT IT?‚ÄÙ

THE MEMBERS EXCHANGED RAPID GLANCES.

‚ÄÚAND NOW, GENTLEMEN, IT‚ÄÔS MY TURN TO ASK QUESTIONS,‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, ASSUMING AN AIR OF DIGNITY. ‚ÄÚLET ME KNOW WHAT BUSINESS YOU HAD TO SET FIRE TO THE TOWN WITHOUT PERMISSION.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THIS! WE, WE SET FIRE TO THE TOWN? THAT IS LAYING THE BLAME ON OTHERS!‚ÄÙ THEY EXCLAIMED.

‚ÄÚI QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CARRIED THE GAME TOO FAR,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH PERSISTED STUBBORNLY, ‚ÄÚBUT IT‚ÄÔS NOT A MATTER OF PETTY SCANDALS WITH YULIA MIHAILOVNA. I‚ÄÔVE BROUGHT YOU HERE GENTLEMEN, TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THE GREATNESS OF THE DANGER YOU HAVE SO STUPIDLY INCURRED, WHICH IS A MENACE TO MUCH BESIDES YOURSELVES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEXCUSE ME, WE, ON THE CONTRARY, WERE INTENDING JUST NOW TO POINT OUT TO YOU THE GREATNESS OF THE DESPOTISM AND UNFAIRNESS YOU HAVE SHOWN IN TAKING SUCH A SERIOUS AND ALSO STRANGE STEP WITHOUT CONSULTING THE MEMBERS,‚ÄÙ VIRGINSKY, WHO HAD BEEN HITHERTO SILENT, PROTESTED, ALMOST WITH INDIGNATION.

‚ÄÚAND SO YOU DENY IT? BUT I MAINTAIN THAT YOU SET FIRE TO THE TOWN, YOU AND NONE BUT YOU. GENTLEMEN, DON‚ÄÔT TELL LIES! I HAVE GOOD EVIDENCE. BY YOUR RASHNESS YOU EXPOSED THE COMMON CAUSE TO DANGER. YOU ARE ONLY ONE KNOT IN AN ENDLESS NETWORK OF KNOTS‚ÄÎAND YOUR DUTY IS BLIND OBEDIENCE TO THE CENTRE. YET THREE MEN OF YOU INCITED THE SHPIGULIN MEN TO SET FIRE TO THE TOWN WITHOUT THE LEAST INSTRUCTION TO DO SO, AND THE FIRE HAS TAKEN PLACE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT THREE? WHAT THREE OF US?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY, AT THREE O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE NIGHT, YOU, TOLKATCHENKO, WERE INCITING FOMKA ZAVYALOV AT THE ‚ÄÒFORGET-ME-NOT.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚUPON MY WORD!‚ÄÙ CRIED THE LATTER, JUMPING UP, ‚ÄÚI SCARCELY SAID A WORD TO HIM, AND WHAT I DID SAY WAS WITHOUT INTENTION, SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN FLOGGED THAT MORNING. AND I DROPPED IT AT ONCE; I SAW HE WAS TOO DRUNK. IF YOU HAD NOT REFERRED TO IT I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN. A WORD COULD NOT SET THE PLACE ON FIRE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE LIKE A MAN WHO SHOULD BE SURPRISED THAT A TINY SPARK COULD BLOW A WHOLE POWDER MAGAZINE INTO THE AIR.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SPOKE IN A WHISPER IN HIS EAR, IN A CORNER; HOW COULD YOU HAVE HEARD OF IT?‚ÄÙ

TOLKATCHENKO REFLECTED SUDDENLY.

‚ÄÚI WAS SITTING THERE UNDER THE TABLE. DON‚ÄÔT DISTURB YOURSELVES, GENTLEMEN; I KNOW EVERY STEP YOU TAKE. YOU SMILE SARCASTICALLY, MR. LIPUTIN? BUT I KNOW, FOR INSTANCE, THAT YOU PINCHED YOUR WIFE BLACK AND BLUE AT MIDNIGHT, THREE DAYS AGO, IN YOUR BEDROOM AS YOU WERE GOING TO BED.‚ÄÙ

LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS MOUTH FELL OPEN AND HE TURNED PALE. (IT WAS AFTERWARDS FOUND OUT THAT HE KNEW OF THIS EXPLOIT OF LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS FROM AGAFYA, LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS SERVANT, WHOM HE HAD PAID FROM THE BEGINNING TO SPY ON HIM; THIS ONLY CAME OUT LATER.)

‚ÄÚMAY I STATE A FACT?‚ÄÙ SAID SHIGALOV, GETTING UP.

‚ÄÚSTATE IT.‚ÄÙ

SHIGALOV SAT DOWN AND PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER.

‚ÄÚSO FAR AS I UNDERSTAND‚ÄÎAND IT‚ÄÔS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO UNDERSTAND IT‚ÄÎYOU YOURSELF AT FIRST AND A SECOND TIME LATER, DREW WITH GREAT ELOQUENCE, BUT TOO THEORETICALLY, A PICTURE OF RUSSIA COVERED WITH AN ENDLESS NETWORK OF KNOTS. EACH OF THESE CENTRES OF ACTIVITY, PROSELYTISING AND RAMIFYING ENDLESSLY, AIMS BY SYSTEMATIC DENUNCIATION TO INJURE THE PRESTIGE OF LOCAL AUTHORITY, TO REDUCE THE VILLAGES TO CONFUSION, TO SPREAD CYNICISM AND SCANDALS, TOGETHER WITH COMPLETE DISBELIEF IN EVERYTHING AND AN EAGERNESS FOR SOMETHING BETTER, AND FINALLY, BY MEANS OF FIRES, AS A PRE-EMINENTLY NATIONAL METHOD, TO REDUCE THE COUNTRY AT A GIVEN MOMENT, IF NEED BE, TO DESPERATION. ARE THOSE YOUR WORDS WHICH I TRIED TO REMEMBER ACCURATELY? IS THAT THE PROGRAMME YOU GAVE US AS THE AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE, WHICH IS TO THIS DAY UTTERLY UNKNOWN TO US AND ALMOST LIKE A MYTH?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS CORRECT, ONLY YOU ARE VERY TEDIOUS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEVERY ONE HAS A RIGHT TO EXPRESS HIMSELF IN HIS OWN WAY. GIVING US TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE SEPARATE KNOTS OF THE GENERAL NETWORK ALREADY COVERING RUSSIA NUMBER BY NOW SEVERAL HUNDRED, AND PROPOUNDING THE THEORY THAT IF EVERY ONE DOES HIS WORK SUCCESSFULLY, ALL RUSSIA AT A GIVEN MOMENT, AT A SIGNAL ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAH, DAMN IT ALL, I HAVE ENOUGH TO DO WITHOUT YOU!‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, TWISTING IN HIS CHAIR.

‚ÄÚVERY WELL, I‚ÄÔLL CUT IT SHORT AND I‚ÄÔLL END SIMPLY BY ASKING IF WE‚ÄÔVE SEEN THE DISORDERLY SCENES, WE‚ÄÔVE SEEN THE DISCONTENT OF THE PEOPLE, WE‚ÄÔVE SEEN AND TAKEN PART IN THE DOWNFALL OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATION, AND FINALLY, WE‚ÄÔVE SEEN WITH OUR OWN EYES THE TOWN ON FIRE? WHAT DO YOU FIND AMISS? ISN‚ÄÔT THAT YOUR PROGRAMME? WHAT CAN YOU BLAME US FOR?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚACTING ON YOUR OWN INITIATIVE!‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH CRIED FURIOUSLY. ‚ÄÚWHILE I AM HERE YOU OUGHT NOT TO HAVE DARED TO ACT WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. ENOUGH. WE ARE ON THE EVE OF BETRAYAL, AND PERHAPS TO-MORROW OR TO-NIGHT YOU‚ÄÔLL BE SEIZED. SO THERE. I HAVE AUTHENTIC INFORMATION.‚ÄÙ

AT THIS ALL WERE AGAPE WITH ASTONISHMENT.

‚ÄÚYOU WILL BE ARRESTED NOT ONLY AS THE INSTIGATORS OF THE FIRE, BUT AS A QUINTET. THE TRAITOR KNOWS THE WHOLE SECRET OF THE NETWORK. SO YOU SEE WHAT A MESS YOU‚ÄÔVE MADE OF IT!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSTAVROGIN, NO DOUBT,‚ÄÙ CRIED LIPUTIN.

‚ÄÚWHAT ‚Ä¶ WHY STAVROGIN?‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SEEMED SUDDENLY TAKEN ABACK. ‚ÄÚHANG IT ALL,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, PULLING HIMSELF TOGETHER AT ONCE, ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS SHATOV! I BELIEVE YOU ALL KNOW NOW THAT SHATOV IN HIS TIME WAS ONE OF THE SOCIETY. I MUST TELL YOU THAT, WATCHING HIM THROUGH PERSONS HE DOES NOT SUSPECT, I FOUND OUT TO MY AMAZEMENT THAT HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT THE ORGANISATION OF THE NETWORK AND ‚Ä¶ EVERYTHING, IN FACT. TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM BEING CHARGED WITH HAVING FORMERLY BELONGED, HE WILL GIVE INFORMATION AGAINST ALL. HE HAS BEEN HESITATING UP TILL NOW AND I HAVE SPARED HIM. YOUR FIRE HAS DECIDED HIM: HE IS SHAKEN AND WILL HESITATE NO LONGER. TO-MORROW WE SHALL BE ARRESTED AS INCENDIARIES AND POLITICAL OFFENDERS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIS IT TRUE? HOW DOES SHATOV KNOW?‚ÄÙ THE EXCITEMENT WAS INDESCRIBABLE.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS ALL PERFECTLY TRUE. I HAVE NO RIGHT TO REVEAL THE SOURCE FROM WHICH I LEARNT IT OR HOW I DISCOVERED IT, BUT I TELL YOU WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU MEANWHILE: THROUGH ONE PERSON I CAN ACT ON SHATOV SO THAT WITHOUT HIS SUSPECTING IT HE WILL PUT OFF GIVING INFORMATION, BUT NOT MORE THAN FOR TWENTY-FOUR HOURS.‚ÄÙ ALL WERE SILENT.

‚ÄÚWE REALLY MUST SEND HIM TO THE DEVIL!‚ÄÙ TOLKATCHENKO WAS THE FIRST TO EXCLAIM.

‚ÄÚIT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DONE LONG AGO,‚ÄÙ LYAMSHIN PUT IN MALIGNANTLY, STRIKING THE TABLE WITH HIS FIST.

‚ÄÚBUT HOW IS IT TO BE DONE?‚ÄÙ MUTTERED LIPUTIN. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH AT ONCE TOOK UP THE QUESTION AND UNFOLDED HIS PLAN. THE PLAN WAS THE FOLLOWING DAY AT NIGHTFALL TO DRAW SHATOV AWAY TO A SECLUDED SPOT TO HAND OVER THE SECRET PRINTING PRESS WHICH HAD BEEN IN HIS KEEPING AND WAS BURIED THERE, AND THERE ‚ÄÚTO SETTLE THINGS.‚ÄÙ HE WENT INTO VARIOUS ESSENTIAL DETAILS WHICH WE WILL OMIT HERE, AND EXPLAINED MINUTELY SHATOV‚ÄÔS PRESENT AMBIGUOUS ATTITUDE TO THE CENTRAL SOCIETY, OF WHICH THE READER KNOWS ALREADY.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS ALL VERY WELL,‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN OBSERVED IRRESOLUTELY, ‚ÄÚBUT SINCE IT WILL BE ANOTHER ADVENTURE ‚Ä¶ OF THE SAME SORT ‚Ä¶ IT WILL MAKE TOO GREAT A SENSATION.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO DOUBT,‚ÄÙ ASSENTED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, ‚ÄÚBUT I‚ÄÔVE PROVIDED AGAINST THAT. WE HAVE THE MEANS OF AVERTING SUSPICION COMPLETELY.‚ÄÙ

AND WITH THE SAME MINUTENESS HE TOLD THEM ABOUT KIRILLOV, OF HIS INTENTION TO SHOOT HIMSELF, AND OF HIS PROMISE TO WAIT FOR A SIGNAL FROM THEM AND TO LEAVE A LETTER BEHIND HIM TAKING ON HIMSELF ANYTHING THEY DICTATED TO HIM (ALL OF WHICH THE READER KNOWS ALREADY).

‚ÄÚHIS DETERMINATION TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE‚ÄÎA PHILOSOPHIC, OR AS I SHOULD CALL IT, INSANE DECISION‚ÄÎHAS BECOME KNOWN THERE‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WENT ON TO EXPLAIN. ‚ÄÚTHERE NOT A THREAD, NOT A GRAIN OF DUST IS OVERLOOKED; EVERYTHING IS TURNED TO THE SERVICE OF THE CAUSE. FORESEEING HOW USEFUL IT MIGHT BE AND SATISFYING THEMSELVES THAT HIS INTENTION WAS QUITE SERIOUS, THEY HAD OFFERED HIM THE MEANS TO COME TO RUSSIA (HE WAS SET FOR SOME REASON ON DYING IN RUSSIA), GAVE HIM A COMMISSION WHICH HE PROMISED TO CARRY OUT (AND HE HAD DONE SO), AND HAD, MOREOVER, BOUND HIM BY A PROMISE, AS YOU ALREADY KNOW, TO COMMIT SUICIDE ONLY WHEN HE WAS TOLD TO. HE PROMISED EVERYTHING. YOU MUST NOTE THAT HE BELONGS TO THE ORGANISATION ON A PARTICULAR FOOTING AND IS ANXIOUS TO BE OF SERVICE; MORE THAN THAT I CAN‚ÄÔT TELL YOU. TO-MORROW, AFTER SHATOV‚ÄÔS AFFAIR, I‚ÄÔLL DICTATE A NOTE TO HIM SAYING THAT HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS DEATH. THAT WILL SEEM VERY PLAUSIBLE: THEY WERE FRIENDS AND TRAVELLED TOGETHER TO AMERICA, THERE THEY QUARRELLED; AND IT WILL ALL BE EXPLAINED IN THE LETTER ‚Ä¶ AND ‚Ä¶ AND PERHAPS, IF IT SEEMS FEASIBLE, WE MIGHT DICTATE SOMETHING MORE TO KIRILLOV‚ÄÎSOMETHING ABOUT THE MANIFESTOES, FOR INSTANCE, AND EVEN PERHAPS ABOUT THE FIRE. BUT I‚ÄÔLL THINK ABOUT THAT. YOU NEEDN‚ÄÔT WORRY YOURSELVES, HE HAS NO PREJUDICES; HE‚ÄÔLL SIGN ANYTHING.‚ÄÙ

THERE WERE EXPRESSIONS OF DOUBT. IT SOUNDED A FANTASTIC STORY. BUT THEY HAD ALL HEARD MORE OR LESS ABOUT KIRILLOV; LIPUTIN MORE THAN ALL.

‚ÄÚHE MAY CHANGE HIS MIND AND NOT WANT TO,‚ÄÙ SAID SHIGALOV; ‚ÄÚHE IS A MADMAN ANYWAY, SO HE IS NOT MUCH TO BUILD UPON.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT BE UNEASY, GENTLEMEN, HE WILL WANT TO,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SNAPPED OUT. ‚ÄÚI AM OBLIGED BY OUR AGREEMENT TO GIVE HIM WARNING THE DAY BEFORE, SO IT MUST BE TO-DAY. I INVITE LIPUTIN TO GO WITH ME AT ONCE TO SEE HIM AND MAKE CERTAIN, AND HE WILL TELL YOU, GENTLEMEN, WHEN HE COMES BACK‚ÄÎTO-DAY IF NEED BE‚ÄÎWHETHER WHAT I SAY IS TRUE. HOWEVER,‚ÄÙ HE BROKE OFF SUDDENLY WITH INTENSE EXASPERATION, AS THOUGH HE SUDDENLY FELT HE WAS DOING PEOPLE LIKE THEM TOO MUCH HONOUR BY WASTING TIME IN PERSUADING THEM, ‚ÄÚHOWEVER, DO AS YOU PLEASE. IF YOU DON‚ÄÔT DECIDE TO DO IT, THE UNION IS BROKEN UP‚ÄÎBUT SOLELY THROUGH YOUR INSUBORDINATION AND TREACHERY. IN THAT CASE WE ARE ALL INDEPENDENT FROM THIS MOMENT. BUT UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, BESIDES THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF SHATOV‚ÄÔS BETRAYAL AND ITS CONSEQUENCES, YOU WILL HAVE BROUGHT UPON YOURSELVES ANOTHER LITTLE UNPLEASANTNESS OF WHICH YOU WERE DEFINITELY WARNED WHEN THE UNION WAS FORMED. AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED, I AM NOT MUCH AFRAID OF YOU, GENTLEMEN.‚Ä¶ DON‚ÄÔT IMAGINE THAT I AM SO INVOLVED WITH YOU.‚Ä¶ BUT THAT‚ÄÔS NO MATTER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, WE DECIDE TO DO IT,‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN PRONOUNCED.

‚ÄÚTHERE‚ÄÔS NO OTHER WAY OUT OF IT,‚ÄÙ MUTTERED TOLKATCHENKO, ‚ÄÚAND IF ONLY LIPUTIN CONFIRMS ABOUT KIRILLOV, THEN ‚Ä¶

‚ÄÚI AM AGAINST IT; WITH ALL MY SOUL AND STRENGTH I PROTEST AGAINST SUCH A MURDEROUS DECISION,‚ÄÙ SAID VIRGINSKY, STANDING UP.

‚ÄÚBUT?‚ÄÙ ASKED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH.‚Ä¶

‚ÄÚBUT WHAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU SAID BUT ‚Ä¶ AND I AM WAITING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT THINK I DID SAY BUT ‚Ä¶ I ONLY MEANT TO SAY THAT IF YOU DECIDE TO DO IT, THEN ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEN?‚ÄÙ

VIRGINSKY DID NOT ANSWER.

‚ÄÚI THINK THAT ONE IS AT LIBERTY TO NEGLECT DANGER TO ONE‚ÄÔS OWN LIFE,‚ÄÙ SAID ERKEL, SUDDENLY OPENING HIS MOUTH, ‚ÄÚBUT IF IT MAY INJURE THE CAUSE, THEN I CONSIDER ONE OUGHT NOT TO DARE TO NEGLECT DANGER TO ONE‚ÄÔS LIFE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

HE BROKE OFF IN CONFUSION, BLUSHING. ABSORBED AS THEY ALL WERE IN THEIR OWN IDEAS, THEY ALL LOOKED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT‚ÄÎIT WAS SUCH A SURPRISE THAT HE TOO COULD SPEAK.

‚ÄÚI AM FOR THE CAUSE,‚ÄÙ VIRGINSKY PRONOUNCED SUDDENLY.

EVERY ONE GOT UP. IT WAS DECIDED TO COMMUNICATE ONCE MORE AND MAKE FINAL ARRANGEMENTS AT MIDDAY ON THE MORROW, THOUGH WITHOUT MEETING. THE PLACE WHERE THE PRINTING PRESS WAS HIDDEN WAS ANNOUNCED AND EACH WAS ASSIGNED HIS PART AND HIS DUTY. LIPUTIN AND PYOTR STEPANOVITCH PROMPTLY SET OFF TOGETHER TO KIRILLOV.

II

ALL OUR FELLOWS BELIEVED THAT SHATOV WAS GOING TO BETRAY THEM; BUT THEY ALSO BELIEVED THAT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS PLAYING WITH THEM LIKE PAWNS. AND YET THEY KNEW, TOO, THAT IN ANY CASE THEY WOULD ALL MEET ON THE SPOT NEXT DAY AND THAT SHATOV‚ÄÔS FATE WAS SEALED. THEY SUDDENLY FELT LIKE FLIES CAUGHT IN A WEB BY A HUGE SPIDER; THEY WERE FURIOUS, BUT THEY WERE TREMBLING WITH TERROR.

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, OF COURSE, HAD TREATED THEM BADLY; IT MIGHT ALL HAVE GONE OFF FAR MORE HARMONIOUSLY AND EASILY IF HE HAD TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO EMBELLISH THE FACTS EVER SO LITTLE. INSTEAD OF PUTTING THE FACTS IN A DECOROUS LIGHT, AS AN EXPLOIT WORTHY OF ANCIENT ROME OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT, HE SIMPLY APPEALED TO THEIR ANIMAL FEARS AND LAID STRESS ON THE DANGER TO THEIR OWN SKINS, WHICH WAS SIMPLY INSULTING; OF COURSE THERE WAS A STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE IN EVERYTHING AND THERE WAS NO OTHER PRINCIPLE IN NATURE, THEY ALL KNEW THAT, BUT STILL.‚Ä¶

BUT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD NO TIME TO TROT OUT THE ROMANS; HE WAS COMPLETELY THROWN OUT OF HIS RECKONING. STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS FLIGHT HAD ASTOUNDED AND CRUSHED HIM. IT WAS A LIE WHEN HE SAID THAT STAVROGIN HAD SEEN THE VICE-GOVERNOR; WHAT WORRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS THAT STAVROGIN HAD GONE OFF WITHOUT SEEING ANYONE, EVEN HIS MOTHER‚ÄÎAND IT WAS CERTAINLY STRANGE THAT HE HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO LEAVE WITHOUT HINDRANCE. (THE AUTHORITIES WERE CALLED TO ACCOUNT FOR IT AFTERWARDS.) PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD BEEN MAKING INQUIRIES ALL DAY, BUT SO FAR HAD FOUND OUT NOTHING, AND HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO UPSET. AND HOW COULD HE, HOW COULD HE GIVE UP STAVROGIN ALL AT ONCE LIKE THIS! THAT WAS WHY HE COULD NOT BE VERY TENDER WITH THE QUINTET. BESIDES, THEY TIED HIS HANDS: HE HAD ALREADY DECIDED TO GALLOP AFTER STAVROGIN AT ONCE; AND MEANWHILE HE WAS DETAINED BY SHATOV; HE HAD TO CEMENT THE QUINTET TOGETHER ONCE FOR ALL, IN CASE OF EMERGENCY. ‚ÄÚPITY TO WASTE THEM, THEY MIGHT BE OF USE.‚ÄÙ THAT, I IMAGINE, WAS HIS WAY OF REASONING.

AS FOR SHATOV, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT HE WOULD BETRAY THEM. ALL THAT HE HAD TOLD THE OTHERS ABOUT IT WAS A LIE: HE HAD NEVER SEEN THE DOCUMENT NOR HEARD OF IT, BUT HE THOUGHT IT AS CERTAIN AS THAT TWICE TWO MAKES FOUR. IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT WHAT HAD HAPPENED‚ÄÎTHE DEATH OF LIZA, THE DEATH OF MARYA TIMOFYEVNA‚ÄÎWOULD BE TOO MUCH FOR SHATOV, AND THAT HE WOULD MAKE UP HIS MIND AT ONCE. WHO KNOWS? PERHAPS HE HAD GROUNDS FOR SUPPOSING IT. IT IS KNOWN, TOO, THAT HE HATED SHATOV PERSONALLY; THERE HAD AT SOME TIME BEEN A QUARREL BETWEEN THEM, AND PYOTR STEPANOVITCH NEVER FORGAVE AN OFFENCE. I AM CONVINCED, INDEED, THAT THIS WAS HIS LEADING MOTIVE.

WE HAVE NARROW BRICK PAVEMENTS IN OUR TOWN, AND IN SOME STREETS ONLY RAISED WOODEN PLANKS INSTEAD OF A PAVEMENT. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WALKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PAVEMENT, TAKING UP THE WHOLE OF IT, UTTERLY REGARDLESS OF LIPUTIN, WHO HAD NO ROOM TO WALK BESIDE HIM AND SO HAD TO HURRY A STEP BEHIND OR RUN IN THE MUDDY ROAD IF HE WANTED TO SPEAK TO HIM. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SUDDENLY REMEMBERED HOW HE HAD LATELY SPLASHED THROUGH THE MUD TO KEEP PACE WITH STAVROGIN, WHO HAD WALKED, AS HE WAS DOING NOW, TAKING UP THE WHOLE PAVEMENT. HE RECALLED THE WHOLE SCENE, AND RAGE CHOKED HIM.

BUT LIPUTIN, TOO, WAS CHOKING WITH RESENTMENT. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH MIGHT TREAT THE OTHERS AS HE LIKED, BUT HIM! WHY, HE KNEW MORE THAN ALL THE REST, WAS IN CLOSER TOUCH WITH THE WORK AND TAKING MORE INTIMATE PART IN IT THAN ANYONE, AND HITHERTO HIS SERVICES HAD BEEN CONTINUAL, THOUGH INDIRECT. OH, HE KNEW THAT EVEN NOW PYOTR STEPANOVITCH MIGHT RUIN HIM IF IT CAME TO THE WORST. BUT HE HAD LONG HATED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, AND NOT BECAUSE HE WAS A DANGER BUT BECAUSE OF HIS OVERBEARING MANNER. NOW, WHEN HE HAD TO MAKE UP HIS MIND TO SUCH A DEED, HE RAGED INWARDLY MORE THAN ALL THE REST PUT TOGETHER. ALAS! HE KNEW THAT NEXT DAY ‚ÄÚLIKE A SLAVE‚ÄÙ HE WOULD BE THE FIRST ON THE SPOT AND WOULD BRING THE OTHERS, AND IF HE COULD SOMEHOW HAVE MURDERED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH BEFORE THE MORROW, WITHOUT RUINING HIMSELF, OF COURSE, HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE MURDERED HIM.

ABSORBED IN HIS SENSATIONS, HE TRUDGED DEJECTEDLY AFTER HIS TORMENTOR, WHO SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN HIS EXISTENCE, THOUGH HE GAVE HIM A RUDE AND CARELESS SHOVE WITH HIS ELBOW NOW AND THEN. SUDDENLY PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HALTED IN ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL THOROUGHFARES AND WENT INTO A RESTAURANT.

‚ÄÚWHAT ARE YOU DOING?‚ÄÙ CRIED LIPUTIN, BOILING OVER. ‚ÄÚTHIS IS A RESTAURANT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WANT A BEEFSTEAK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚUPON MY WORD! IT IS ALWAYS FULL OF PEOPLE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT IF IT IS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT ‚Ä¶ WE SHALL BE LATE. IT‚ÄÔS TEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK ALREADY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU CAN‚ÄÔT BE TOO LATE TO GO THERE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT I SHALL BE LATE! THEY ARE EXPECTING ME BACK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, LET THEM; BUT IT WOULD BE STUPID OF YOU TO GO TO THEM. WITH ALL YOUR BOBBERY I‚ÄÔVE HAD NO DINNER. AND THE LATER YOU GO TO KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS THE MORE SURE YOU ARE TO FIND HIM.‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WENT TO A ROOM APART. LIPUTIN SAT IN AN EASY CHAIR ON ONE SIDE, ANGRY AND RESENTFUL, AND WATCHED HIM EATING. HALF AN HOUR AND MORE PASSED. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH DID NOT HURRY HIMSELF; HE ATE WITH RELISH, RANG THE BELL, ASKED FOR A DIFFERENT KIND OF MUSTARD, THEN FOR BEER, WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO LIPUTIN. HE WAS PONDERING DEEPLY. HE WAS CAPABLE OF DOING TWO THINGS AT ONCE‚ÄÎEATING WITH RELISH AND PONDERING DEEPLY. LIPUTIN LOATHED HIM SO INTENSELY AT LAST THAT HE COULD NOT TEAR HIMSELF AWAY. IT WAS LIKE A NERVOUS OBSESSION. HE COUNTED EVERY MORSEL OF BEEFSTEAK THAT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH PUT INTO HIS MOUTH; HE LOATHED HIM FOR THE WAY HE OPENED IT, FOR THE WAY HE CHEWED, FOR THE WAY HE SMACKED HIS LIPS OVER THE FAT MORSELS, HE LOATHED THE STEAK ITSELF. AT LAST THINGS BEGAN TO SWIM BEFORE HIS EYES; HE BEGAN TO FEEL SLIGHTLY GIDDY; HE FELT HOT AND COLD RUN DOWN HIS SPINE BY TURNS.

‚ÄÚYOU ARE DOING NOTHING; READ THAT,‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SUDDENLY, THROWING HIM A SHEET OF PAPER. LIPUTIN WENT NEARER TO THE CANDLE. THE PAPER WAS CLOSELY COVERED WITH BAD HANDWRITING, WITH CORRECTIONS IN EVERY LINE. BY THE TIME HE HAD MASTERED IT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD PAID HIS BILL AND WAS READY TO GO. WHEN THEY WERE ON THE PAVEMENT LIPUTIN HANDED HIM BACK THE PAPER.

‚ÄÚKEEP IT; I‚ÄÔLL TELL YOU AFTERWARDS.‚Ä¶ WHAT DO YOU SAY TO IT, THOUGH?‚ÄÙ

LIPUTIN SHUDDERED ALL OVER.

‚ÄÚIN MY OPINION ‚Ä¶ SUCH A MANIFESTO ‚Ä¶ IS NOTHING BUT A RIDICULOUS ABSURDITY.‚ÄÙ

HIS ANGER BROKE OUT; HE FELT AS THOUGH HE WERE BEING CAUGHT UP AND CARRIED ALONG.

‚ÄÚIF WE DECIDE TO DISTRIBUTE SUCH MANIFESTOES,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, QUIVERING ALL OVER, ‚ÄÚWE‚ÄÔLL MAKE OURSELVES, CONTEMPTIBLE BY OUR STUPIDITY AND INCOMPETENCE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚH‚ÄÔM! I THINK DIFFERENTLY,‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WALKING ON RESOLUTELY.

‚ÄÚSO DO I; SURELY IT ISN‚ÄÔT YOUR WORK?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS NOT YOUR BUSINESS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI THINK TOO THAT DOGGEREL, ‚ÄÒA NOBLE PERSONALITY,‚ÄÔ IS THE MOST UTTER TRASH POSSIBLE, AND IT COULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY HERZEN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE TALKING NONSENSE; IT‚ÄÔS A GOOD POEM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM SURPRISED, TOO, FOR INSTANCE,‚ÄÙ SAID LIPUTIN, STILL DASHING ALONG WITH DESPERATE LEAPS, ‚ÄÚTHAT IT IS SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD ACT SO AS TO BRING EVERYTHING TO THE GROUND. IT‚ÄÔS NATURAL IN EUROPE TO WISH TO DESTROY EVERYTHING BECAUSE THERE‚ÄÔS A PROLETARIAT THERE, BUT WE ARE ONLY AMATEURS HERE AND IN MY OPINION ARE ONLY SHOWING OFF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI THOUGHT YOU WERE A FOURIERIST.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFOURIER SAYS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT, QUITE DIFFERENT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNOW IT‚ÄÔS NONSENSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, FOURIER ISN‚ÄÔT NONSENSE.‚Ä¶ EXCUSE ME, I CAN‚ÄÔT BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE A RISING IN MAY.‚ÄÙ

LIPUTIN POSITIVELY UNBUTTONED HIS COAT, HE WAS SO HOT.

‚ÄÚWELL, THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH; BUT NOW, THAT I MAYN‚ÄÔT FORGET IT,‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, PASSING WITH EXTRAORDINARY COOLNESS TO ANOTHER SUBJECT, ‚ÄÚYOU WILL HAVE TO PRINT THIS MANIFESTO WITH YOUR OWN HANDS. WE‚ÄÔRE GOING TO DIG UP SHATOV‚ÄÔS PRINTING PRESS, AND YOU WILL TAKE IT TO-MORROW. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE YOU MUST PRINT AS MANY COPIES AS YOU CAN, AND THEN DISTRIBUTE THEM ALL THE WINTER. THE MEANS WILL BE PROVIDED. YOU MUST DO AS MANY COPIES AS POSSIBLE, FOR YOU‚ÄÔLL BE ASKED FOR THEM FROM OTHER PLACES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, EXCUSE ME; I CAN‚ÄÔT UNDERTAKE SUCH A ‚Ä¶ I DECLINE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔLL TAKE IT ALL THE SAME. I AM ACTING ON THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE, AND YOU ARE BOUND TO OBEY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND I CONSIDER THAT OUR CENTRES ABROAD HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT RUSSIA IS LIKE AND HAVE LOST ALL TOUCH, AND THAT‚ÄÔS WHY THEY TALK SUCH NONSENSE.‚Ä¶ I EVEN THINK THAT INSTEAD OF MANY HUNDREDS OF QUINTETS IN RUSSIA, WE ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT EXISTS, AND THERE IS NO NETWORK AT ALL,‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN GASPED FINALLY.

‚ÄÚTHE MORE CONTEMPTIBLE OF YOU, THEN, TO RUN AFTER THE CAUSE WITHOUT BELIEVING IN IT ‚Ä¶ AND YOU ARE RUNNING AFTER ME NOW LIKE A MEAN LITTLE CUR.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, I‚ÄÔM NOT. WE HAVE A FULL RIGHT TO BREAK OFF AND FOUND A NEW SOCIETY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFOOL!‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH BOOMED AT HIM THREATENINGLY ALL OF A SUDDEN, WITH FLASHING EYES.

THEY STOOD FACING ONE ANOTHER FOR SOME TIME. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH TURNED AND PURSUED HIS WAY CONFIDENTLY.

THE IDEA FLASHED THROUGH LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS MIND, ‚ÄÚTURN AND GO BACK; IF I DON‚ÄÔT TURN NOW I SHALL NEVER GO BACK.‚ÄÙ HE PONDERED THIS FOR TEN STEPS, BUT AT THE ELEVENTH A NEW AND DESPERATE IDEA FLASHED INTO HIS MIND: HE DID NOT TURN AND DID NOT GO BACK.

THEY WERE APPROACHING FILIPOV‚ÄÔS HOUSE, BUT BEFORE REACHING IT THEY TURNED DOWN A SIDE STREET, OR, TO BE MORE ACCURATE, AN INCONSPICUOUS PATH UNDER A FENCE, SO THAT FOR SOME TIME THEY HAD TO WALK ALONG A STEEP SLOPE ABOVE A DITCH WHERE THEY COULD NOT KEEP THEIR FOOTING WITHOUT HOLDING THE FENCE. AT A DARK CORNER IN THE SLANTING FENCE PYOTR STEPANOVITCH TOOK OUT A PLANK, LEAVING A GAP, THROUGH WHICH HE PROMPTLY SCRAMBLED. LIPUTIN WAS SURPRISED, BUT HE CRAWLED THROUGH AFTER HIM; THEN THEY REPLACED THE PLANK AFTER THEM. THIS WAS THE SECRET WAY BY WHICH FEDKA USED TO VISIT KIRILLOV.

‚ÄÚSHATOV MUSTN‚ÄÔT KNOW THAT WE ARE HERE,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WHISPERED STERNLY TO LIPUTIN.

III

KIRILLOV WAS SITTING ON HIS LEATHER SOFA DRINKING TEA, AS HE ALWAYS WAS AT THAT HOUR. HE DID NOT GET UP TO MEET THEM, BUT GAVE A SORT OF START AND LOOKED AT THE NEW-COMERS ANXIOUSLY.

‚ÄÚYOU ARE NOT MISTAKEN,‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS JUST THAT I‚ÄÔVE COME ABOUT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO-DAY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, NO, TO-MORROW ‚Ä¶ ABOUT THIS TIME.‚ÄÙ AND HE HURRIEDLY SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE, WATCHING KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS AGITATION WITH SOME UNEASINESS. BUT THE LATTER HAD ALREADY REGAINED HIS COMPOSURE AND LOOKED AS USUAL.

‚ÄÚTHESE PEOPLE STILL REFUSE TO BELIEVE IN YOU. YOU ARE NOT VEXED AT MY BRINGING LIPUTIN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO-DAY I AM NOT VEXED; TO-MORROW I WANT TO BE ALONE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT NOT BEFORE I COME, AND THEREFORE IN MY PRESENCE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SHOULD PREFER NOT IN YOUR PRESENCE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU REMEMBER YOU PROMISED TO WRITE AND TO SIGN ALL I DICTATED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT CARE. AND NOW WILL YOU BE HERE LONG?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI HAVE TO SEE ONE MAN AND TO REMAIN HALF AN HOUR, SO WHATEVER YOU SAY I SHALL STAY THAT HALF-HOUR.‚ÄÙ

KIRILLOV DID NOT SPEAK. LIPUTIN MEANWHILE SAT DOWN ON ONE SIDE UNDER THE PORTRAIT OF THE BISHOP. THAT LAST DESPERATE IDEA GAINED MORE AND MORE POSSESSION OF HIM. KIRILLOV SCARCELY NOTICED HIM. LIPUTIN HAD HEARD OF KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS THEORY BEFORE AND ALWAYS LAUGHED AT HIM; BUT NOW HE WAS SILENT AND LOOKED GLOOMILY ROUND HIM.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE NO OBJECTION TO SOME TEA,‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, MOVING UP. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE JUST HAD SOME STEAK AND WAS RECKONING ON GETTING TEA WITH YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDRINK IT. YOU CAN HAVE SOME IF YOU LIKE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU USED TO OFFER IT TO ME,‚ÄÙ OBSERVED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SOURLY.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS NO MATTER. LET LIPUTIN HAVE SOME TOO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, I ‚Ä¶ CAN‚ÄÔT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT WANT TO OR CAN‚ÄÔT?‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, TURNING QUICKLY TO HIM.

‚ÄÚI AM NOT GOING TO HERE,‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN SAID EXPRESSIVELY.

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH FROWNED.

‚ÄÚTHERE‚ÄÔS A FLAVOUR OF MYSTICISM ABOUT THAT; GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT TO MAKE OF YOU PEOPLE!‚ÄÙ

NO ONE ANSWERED; THERE WAS A FULL MINUTE OF SILENCE.

‚ÄÚBUT I KNOW ONE THING,‚ÄÙ HE ADDED ABRUPTLY, ‚ÄÚTHAT NO SUPERSTITION WILL PREVENT ANY ONE OF US FROM DOING HIS DUTY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHAS STAVROGIN GONE?‚ÄÙ ASKED KIRILLOV.

‚ÄÚYES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS DONE WELL.‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS EYES GLEAMED, BUT HE RESTRAINED HIMSELF.

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT CARE WHAT YOU THINK AS LONG AS EVERY ONE KEEPS HIS WORD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL KEEP MY WORD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI ALWAYS KNEW THAT YOU WOULD DO YOUR DUTY LIKE AN INDEPENDENT AND PROGRESSIVE MAN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE AN ABSURD FELLOW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT MAY BE; I AM VERY GLAD TO AMUSE YOU. I AM ALWAYS GLAD IF I CAN GIVE PEOPLE PLEASURE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE VERY ANXIOUS I SHOULD SHOOT MYSELF AND ARE AFRAID I MIGHT SUDDENLY NOT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, YOU SEE, IT WAS YOUR OWN DOING‚ÄÎCONNECTING YOUR PLAN WITH OUR WORK. RECKONING ON YOUR PLAN WE HAVE ALREADY DONE SOMETHING, SO THAT YOU COULDN‚ÄÔT REFUSE NOW BECAUSE YOU‚ÄÔVE LET US IN FOR IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE NO CLAIM AT ALL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI UNDERSTAND, I UNDERSTAND; YOU ARE PERFECTLY FREE, AND WE DON‚ÄÔT COME IN SO LONG AS YOUR FREE INTENTION IS CARRIED OUT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND AM I TO TAKE ON MYSELF ALL THE NASTY THINGS YOU‚ÄÔVE DONE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLISTEN, KIRILLOV, ARE YOU AFRAID? IF YOU WANT TO CRY OFF, SAY SO AT ONCE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM NOT AFRAID.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI ASK BECAUSE YOU ARE MAKING SO MANY INQUIRIES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚARE YOU GOING SOON?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚASKING QUESTIONS AGAIN?‚ÄÙ

KIRILLOV SCANNED HIM CONTEMPTUOUSLY.

‚ÄÚYOU SEE,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WENT ON, GETTING ANGRIER AND ANGRIER, AND UNABLE TO TAKE THE RIGHT TONE, ‚ÄÚYOU WANT ME TO GO AWAY, TO BE ALONE, TO CONCENTRATE YOURSELF, BUT ALL THAT‚ÄÔS A BAD SIGN FOR YOU‚ÄÎFOR YOU ABOVE ALL. YOU WANT TO THINK A GREAT DEAL. TO MY MIND YOU‚ÄÔD BETTER NOT THINK. AND REALLY YOU MAKE ME UNEASY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHERE‚ÄÔS ONLY ONE THING I HATE, THAT AT SUCH A MOMENT I SHOULD HAVE A REPTILE LIKE YOU BESIDE ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, THAT DOESN‚ÄÔT MATTER. I‚ÄÔLL GO AWAY AT THE TIME AND STAND ON THE STEPS IF YOU LIKE. IF YOU ARE SO CONCERNED ABOUT TRIFLES WHEN IT COMES TO DYING, THEN ‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS ALL A VERY BAD SIGN. I‚ÄÔLL GO OUT ON TO THE STEPS AND YOU CAN IMAGINE I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT, AND THAT I AM A MAN INFINITELY BELOW YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, NOT INFINITELY; YOU‚ÄÔVE GOT ABILITIES, BUT THERE‚ÄÔS A LOT YOU DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND BECAUSE YOU ARE A LOW MAN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDELIGHTED, DELIGHTED. I TOLD YOU ALREADY I AM DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE ENTERTAINMENT ‚Ä¶ AT SUCH A MOMENT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT IS, I ‚Ä¶ WELL, I LISTEN WITH RESPECT, ANYWAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU CAN DO NOTHING; EVEN NOW YOU CAN‚ÄÔT HIDE YOUR PETTY SPITE, THOUGH IT‚ÄÔS NOT TO YOUR INTEREST TO SHOW IT. YOU‚ÄÔLL MAKE ME CROSS, AND THEN I MAY WANT ANOTHER SIX MONTHS.‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH LOOKED AT HIS WATCH. ‚ÄÚI NEVER UNDERSTOOD YOUR THEORY, BUT I KNOW YOU DIDN‚ÄÔT INVENT IT FOR OUR SAKES, SO I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD CARRY IT OUT APART FROM US. AND I KNOW TOO THAT YOU HAVEN‚ÄÔT MASTERED THE IDEA BUT THE IDEA HAS MASTERED YOU, SO YOU WON‚ÄÔT PUT IT OFF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT? THE IDEA HAS MASTERED ME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND NOT I MASTERED THE IDEA? THAT‚ÄÔS GOOD. YOU HAVE A LITTLE SENSE. ONLY YOU TEASE ME AND I AM PROUD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS A GOOD THING, THAT‚ÄÔS A GOOD THING. JUST WHAT YOU NEED, TO BE PROUD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚENOUGH. YOU‚ÄÔVE DRUNK YOUR TEA; GO AWAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDAMN IT ALL, I SUPPOSE I MUST‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎPYOTR STEPANOVITCH GOT UP‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚTHOUGH IT‚ÄÔS EARLY. LISTEN, KIRILLOV. SHALL I FIND THAT MAN‚ÄÎYOU KNOW WHOM I MEAN‚ÄÎAT MYASNITCHIHA‚ÄÔS? OR HAS SHE TOO BEEN LYING?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU WON‚ÄÔT FIND HIM, BECAUSE HE IS HERE AND NOT THERE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHERE! DAMN IT ALL, WHERE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSITTING IN THE KITCHEN, EATING AND DRINKING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW DARED HE?‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, FLUSHING ANGRILY. ‚ÄÚIT WAS HIS DUTY TO WAIT ‚Ä¶ WHAT NONSENSE! HE HAS NO PASSPORT, NO MONEY!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT KNOW. HE CAME TO SAY GOOD-BYE; HE IS DRESSED AND READY. HE IS GOING AWAY AND WON‚ÄÔT COME BACK. HE SAYS YOU ARE A SCOUNDREL AND HE DOESN‚ÄÔT WANT TO WAIT FOR YOUR MONEY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHA HA! HE IS AFRAID THAT I‚ÄÔLL ‚Ä¶ BUT EVEN NOW I CAN ‚Ä¶ IF ‚Ä¶ WHERE IS HE, IN THE KITCHEN?‚ÄÙ

KIRILLOV OPENED A SIDE DOOR INTO A TINY DARK ROOM; FROM THIS ROOM THREE STEPS LED STRAIGHT TO THE PART OF THE KITCHEN WHERE THE COOK‚ÄÔS BED WAS USUALLY PUT, BEHIND THE PARTITION. HERE, IN THE CORNER UNDER THE IKONS, FEDKA WAS SITTING NOW, AT A BARE DEAL TABLE. BEFORE HIM STOOD A PINT BOTTLE, A PLATE OF BREAD, AND SOME COLD BEEF AND POTATOES ON AN EARTHENWARE DISH. HE WAS EATING IN A LEISURELY WAY AND WAS ALREADY HALF DRUNK, BUT HE WAS WEARING HIS SHEEP-SKIN COAT AND WAS EVIDENTLY READY FOR A JOURNEY. A SAMOVAR WAS BOILING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN, BUT IT WAS NOT FOR FEDKA, WHO HAD EVERY NIGHT FOR A WEEK OR MORE ZEALOUSLY BLOWN IT UP AND GOT IT READY FOR ‚ÄÚALEXEY NILITCH, FOR HE‚ÄÔS SUCH A HABIT OF DRINKING TEA AT NIGHTS.‚ÄÙ I AM STRONGLY DISPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT, AS KIRILLOV HAD NOT A COOK, HE HAD COOKED THE BEEF AND POTATOES THAT MORNING WITH HIS OWN HANDS FOR FEDKA.

‚ÄÚWHAT NOTION IS THIS?‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WHISKING INTO THE ROOM. ‚ÄÚWHY DIDN‚ÄÔT YOU WAIT WHERE YOU WERE ORDERED?‚ÄÙ

AND SWINGING HIS FIST, HE BROUGHT IT DOWN HEAVILY ON THE TABLE.

FEDKA ASSUMED AN AIR OF DIGNITY.

‚ÄÚYOU WAIT A BIT, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, YOU WAIT A BIT,‚ÄÙ HE BEGAN, WITH A SWAGGERING EMPHASIS ON EACH WORD, ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS YOUR FIRST DUTY TO UNDERSTAND HERE THAT YOU ARE ON A POLITE VISIT TO MR. KIRILLOV, ALEXEY NILITCH, WHOSE BOOTS YOU MIGHT CLEAN ANY DAY, BECAUSE BESIDE YOU HE IS A MAN OF CULTURE AND YOU ARE ONLY‚ÄÎFOO!‚ÄÙ

AND HE MADE A JAUNTY SHOW OF SPITTING TO ONE SIDE. HAUGHTINESS AND DETERMINATION WERE EVIDENT IN HIS MANNER, AND A CERTAIN VERY THREATENING ASSUMPTION OF ARGUMENTATIVE CALM THAT SUGGESTED AN OUTBURST TO FOLLOW. BUT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD NO TIME TO REALISE THE DANGER, AND IT DID NOT FIT IN WITH HIS PRECONCEIVED IDEAS. THE INCIDENTS AND DISASTERS OF THE DAY HAD QUITE TURNED HIS HEAD. LIPUTIN, AT THE TOP OF THE THREE STEPS, STARED INQUISITIVELY DOWN FROM THE LITTLE DARK ROOM.

‚ÄÚDO YOU OR DON‚ÄÔT YOU WANT A TRUSTWORTHY PASSPORT AND GOOD MONEY TO GO WHERE YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN TOLD? YES OR NO?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚD‚ÄÔYOU SEE, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN DECEIVING ME FROM THE FIRST, AND SO YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN A REGULAR SCOUNDREL TO ME. FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A FILTHY HUMAN LOUSE‚ÄÎTHAT‚ÄÔS HOW I LOOK ON YOU. YOU‚ÄÔVE PROMISED ME A LOT OF MONEY FOR SHEDDING INNOCENT BLOOD AND SWORE IT WAS FOR MR. STAVROGIN, THOUGH IT TURNS OUT TO BE NOTHING BUT YOUR WANT OF BREEDING. I DIDN‚ÄÔT GET A FARTHING OUT OF IT, LET ALONE FIFTEEN HUNDRED, AND MR. STAVROGIN HIT YOU IN THE FACE, WHICH HAS COME TO OUR EARS. NOW YOU ARE THREATENING ME AGAIN AND PROMISING ME MONEY‚ÄÎWHAT FOR, YOU DON‚ÄÔT SAY. AND I SHOULDN‚ÄÔT WONDER IF YOU ARE SENDING ME TO PETERSBURG TO PLOT SOME REVENGE IN YOUR SPITE AGAINST MR. STAVROGIN, NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH, RECKONING ON MY SIMPLICITY. AND THAT PROVES YOU ARE THE CHIEF MURDERER. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DESERVE FOR THE VERY FACT THAT IN THE DEPRAVITY OF YOUR HEART YOU‚ÄÔVE GIVEN UP BELIEVING IN GOD HIMSELF, THE TRUE CREATOR? YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN AN IDOLATER AND ARE ON A LEVEL WITH THE TATAR AND THE MORDVA. ALEXEY NILITCH, WHO IS A PHILOSOPHER, HAS EXPOUNDED THE TRUE GOD, THE CREATOR, MANY A TIME TO YOU, AS WELL AS THE CREATION OF THE WORLD AND THE FATE THAT‚ÄÔS TO COME AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF EVERY SORT OF CREATURE AND EVERY SORT OF BEAST OUT OF THE APOCALYPSE, BUT YOU‚ÄÔVE PERSISTED LIKE A SENSELESS IDOL IN YOUR DEAFNESS AND YOUR DUMBNESS AND HAVE BROUGHT ENSIGN ERKEL TO THE SAME, LIKE THE VERIEST EVIL SEDUCER AND SO-CALLED ATHEIST.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAH, YOU DRUNKEN DOG! HE STRIPS THE IKONS OF THEIR SETTING AND THEN PREACHES ABOUT GOD!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚD‚ÄÔYOU SEE, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, I TELL YOU TRULY THAT I HAVE STRIPPED THE IKONS, BUT I ONLY TOOK OUT THE PEARLS; AND HOW DO YOU KNOW? PERHAPS MY OWN TEAR WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A PEARL IN THE FURNACE OF THE MOST HIGH TO MAKE UP FOR MY SUFFERINGS, SEEING I AM JUST THAT VERY ORPHAN, HAVING NO DAILY REFUGE. DO YOU KNOW FROM THE BOOKS THAT ONCE, IN ANCIENT TIMES, A MERCHANT WITH JUST SUCH TEARFUL SIGHS AND PRAYERS STOLE A PEARL FROM THE HALO OF THE MOTHER OF GOD, AND AFTERWARDS, IN THE FACE OF ALL THE PEOPLE, LAID THE WHOLE PRICE OF IT AT HER FEET, AND THE HOLY MOTHER SHELTERED HIM WITH HER MANTLE BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE, SO THAT IT WAS A MIRACLE, AND THE COMMAND WAS GIVEN THROUGH THE AUTHORITIES TO WRITE IT ALL DOWN WORD FOR WORD IN THE IMPERIAL BOOKS. AND YOU LET A MOUSE IN, SO YOU INSULTED THE VERY THRONE OF GOD. AND IF YOU WERE NOT MY NATURAL MASTER, WHOM I DANDLED IN MY ARMS WHEN I WAS A STRIPLING, I WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU NOW, WITHOUT BUDGING FROM THIS PLACE!‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH FLEW INTO A VIOLENT RAGE.

‚ÄÚTELL ME, HAVE YOU SEEN STAVROGIN TO-DAY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT YOU DARE TO QUESTION ME. MR. STAVROGIN IS FAIRLY AMAZED AT YOU, AND HE HAD NO SHARE IN IT EVEN IN WISH, LET ALONE INSTRUCTIONS OR GIVING MONEY. YOU‚ÄÔVE PRESUMED WITH ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔLL GET THE MONEY AND YOU‚ÄÔLL GET ANOTHER TWO THOUSAND IN PETERSBURG, WHEN YOU GET THERE, IN A LUMP SUM, AND YOU‚ÄÔLL GET MORE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE LYING, MY FINE GENTLEMAN, AND IT MAKES ME LAUGH TO SEE HOW EASILY YOU ARE TAKEN IN. MR. STAVROGIN STANDS AT THE TOP OF THE LADDER ABOVE YOU, AND YOU YELP AT HIM FROM BELOW LIKE A SILLY PUPPY DOG, WHILE HE THINKS IT WOULD BE DOING YOU AN HONOUR TO SPIT AT YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT DO YOU KNOW,‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH IN A RAGE, ‚ÄÚTHAT I WON‚ÄÔT LET YOU STIR A STEP FROM HERE, YOU SCOUNDREL, AND I‚ÄÔLL HAND YOU STRAIGHT OVER TO THE POLICE.‚ÄÙ

FEDKA LEAPT ON TO HIS FEET AND HIS EYES GLEAMED WITH FURY. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH PULLED OUT HIS REVOLVER. THEN FOLLOWED A RAPID AND REVOLTING SCENE: BEFORE PYOTR STEPANOVITCH COULD TAKE AIM, FEDKA SWUNG ROUND AND IN A FLASH STRUCK HIM ON THE CHEEK WITH ALL HIS MIGHT. THEN THERE WAS THE THUD OF A SECOND BLOW, A THIRD, THEN A FOURTH, ALL ON THE CHEEK. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS DAZED; WITH HIS EYES STARTING OUT OF HIS HEAD, HE MUTTERED SOMETHING, AND SUDDENLY CRASHED FULL LENGTH TO THE GROUND.

‚ÄÚTHERE YOU ARE; TAKE HIM,‚ÄÙ SHOUTED FEDKA WITH A TRIUMPHANT SWAGGER; HE INSTANTLY TOOK UP HIS CAP, HIS BAG FROM UNDER THE BENCH, AND WAS GONE. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH LAY GASPING AND UNCONSCIOUS. LIPUTIN EVEN IMAGINED THAT HE HAD BEEN MURDERED. KIRILLOV RAN HEADLONG INTO THE KITCHEN.

‚ÄÚWATER!‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, AND LADLING SOME WATER IN AN IRON DIPPER FROM A BUCKET, HE POURED IT OVER THE INJURED MAN‚ÄÔS HEAD. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH STIRRED, RAISED HIS HEAD, SAT UP, AND LOOKED BLANKLY ABOUT HIM.

‚ÄÚWELL, HOW ARE YOU?‚ÄÙ ASKED KIRILLOV. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH LOOKED AT HIM INTENTLY, STILL NOT RECOGNISING HIM; BUT SEEING LIPUTIN PEEPING IN FROM THE KITCHEN, HE SMILED HIS HATEFUL SMILE AND SUDDENLY GOT UP, PICKING UP HIS REVOLVER FROM THE FLOOR.

‚ÄÚIF YOU TAKE IT INTO YOUR HEAD TO RUN AWAY TO-MORROW LIKE THAT SCOUNDREL STAVROGIN,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, POUNCING FURIOUSLY ON KIRILLOV, PALE, STAMMERING, AND HARDLY ABLE TO ARTICULATE HIS WORDS, ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL HANG YOU ‚Ä¶ LIKE A FLY ‚Ä¶ OR CRUSH YOU ‚Ä¶ IF IT‚ÄÔS AT THE OTHER END OF THE WORLD ‚Ä¶ DO YOU UNDERSTAND!‚ÄÙ

AND HE HELD THE REVOLVER STRAIGHT AT KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS HEAD; BUT ALMOST AT THE SAME MINUTE, COMING COMPLETELY TO HIMSELF, HE DREW BACK HIS HAND, THRUST THE REVOLVER INTO HIS POCKET, AND WITHOUT SAYING ANOTHER WORD RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE. LIPUTIN FOLLOWED HIM. THEY CLAMBERED THROUGH THE SAME GAP AND AGAIN WALKED ALONG THE SLOPE HOLDING TO THE FENCE. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH STRODE RAPIDLY DOWN THE STREET SO THAT LIPUTIN COULD SCARCELY KEEP UP WITH HIM. AT THE FIRST CROSSING HE SUDDENLY STOPPED.

‚ÄÚWELL?‚ÄÙ HE TURNED TO LIPUTIN WITH A CHALLENGE.

LIPUTIN REMEMBERED THE REVOLVER AND WAS STILL TREMBLING ALL OVER AFTER THE SCENE HE HAD WITNESSED; BUT THE ANSWER SEEMED TO COME OF ITSELF IRRESISTIBLY FROM HIS TONGUE:

‚ÄÚI THINK ‚Ä¶ I THINK THAT ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDID YOU SEE WHAT FEDKA WAS DRINKING IN THE KITCHEN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT HE WAS DRINKING? HE WAS DRINKING VODKA.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL THEN, LET ME TELL YOU IT‚ÄÔS THE LAST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WILL DRINK VODKA. I RECOMMEND YOU TO REMEMBER THAT AND REFLECT ON IT. AND NOW GO TO HELL; YOU ARE NOT WANTED TILL TO-MORROW. BUT MIND NOW, DON‚ÄÔT BE A FOOL!‚ÄÙ

LIPUTIN RUSHED HOME FULL SPEED.

IV

HE HAD LONG HAD A PASSPORT IN READINESS MADE OUT IN A FALSE NAME. IT SEEMS A WILD IDEA THAT THIS PRUDENT LITTLE MAN, THE PETTY DESPOT OF HIS FAMILY, WHO WAS, ABOVE ALL THINGS, A SHARP MAN OF BUSINESS AND A CAPITALIST, AND WHO WAS AN OFFICIAL TOO (THOUGH HE WAS A FOURIERIST), SHOULD LONG BEFORE HAVE CONCEIVED THE FANTASTIC PROJECT OF PROCURING THIS PASSPORT IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, THAT HE MIGHT ESCAPE ABROAD BY MEANS OF IT IF ‚Ä¶ HE DID ADMIT THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS IF, THOUGH NO DOUBT HE WAS NEVER ABLE HIMSELF TO FORMULATE WHAT THIS IF MIGHT MEAN.

BUT NOW IT SUDDENLY FORMULATED ITSELF, AND IN A MOST UNEXPECTED WAY. THAT DESPERATE IDEA WITH WHICH HE HAD GONE TO KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS AFTER THAT ‚ÄÚFOOL‚ÄÙ HE HAD HEARD FROM PYOTR STEPANOVITCH ON THE PAVEMENT, HAD BEEN TO ABANDON EVERYTHING AT DAWN NEXT DAY AND TO EMIGRATE ABROAD. IF ANYONE DOUBTS THAT SUCH FANTASTIC INCIDENTS OCCUR IN EVERYDAY RUSSIAN LIFE, EVEN NOW, LET HIM LOOK INTO THE BIOGRAPHIES OF ALL THE RUSSIAN EXILES ABROAD. NOT ONE OF THEM ESCAPED WITH MORE WISDOM OR REAL JUSTIFICATION. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE UNRESTRAINED DOMINATION OF PHANTOMS AND NOTHING MORE.

RUNNING HOME, HE BEGAN BY LOCKING HIMSELF IN, GETTING OUT HIS TRAVELLING BAG, AND FEVERISHLY BEGINNING TO PACK. HIS CHIEF ANXIETY WAS THE QUESTION OF MONEY, AND HOW MUCH HE COULD RESCUE FROM THE IMPENDING RUIN‚ÄÎAND BY WHAT MEANS. HE THOUGHT OF IT AS ‚ÄÚRESCUING,‚ÄÙ FOR IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE COULD NOT LINGER AN HOUR, AND THAT BY DAYLIGHT HE MUST BE ON THE HIGH ROAD. HE DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO TAKE THE TRAIN EITHER; HE VAGUELY DETERMINED TO TAKE IT AT THE SECOND OR THIRD BIG STATION FROM THE TOWN, AND TO MAKE HIS WAY THERE ON FOOT, IF NECESSARY. IN THAT WAY, INSTINCTIVELY AND MECHANICALLY HE BUSIED HIMSELF IN HIS PACKING WITH A PERFECT WHIRL OF IDEAS IN HIS HEAD‚ÄÎAND SUDDENLY STOPPED SHORT, GAVE IT ALL UP, AND WITH A DEEP GROAN STRETCHED HIMSELF ON THE SOFA.

HE FELT CLEARLY, AND SUDDENLY REALISED THAT HE MIGHT ESCAPE, BUT THAT HE WAS BY NOW UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF DECIDING WHETHER HE OUGHT TO MAKE OFF BEFORE OR AFTER SHATOV‚ÄÔS DEATH; THAT HE WAS SIMPLY A LIFELESS BODY, A CRUDE INERT MASS; THAT HE WAS BEING MOVED BY AN AWFUL OUTSIDE POWER; AND THAT, THOUGH HE HAD A PASSPORT TO GO ABROAD, THAT THOUGH HE COULD RUN AWAY FROM SHATOV (OTHERWISE WHAT NEED WAS THERE OF SUCH HASTE?), YET HE WOULD RUN AWAY, NOT FROM SHATOV, NOT BEFORE HIS MURDER, BUT AFTER IT, AND THAT THAT WAS DETERMINED, SIGNED, AND SEALED.

IN INSUFFERABLE DISTRESS, TREMBLING EVERY INSTANT AND WONDERING AT HIMSELF, ALTERNATELY GROANING ALOUD AND NUMB WITH TERROR, HE MANAGED TO EXIST TILL ELEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK NEXT MORNING LOCKED IN AND LYING ON THE SOFA; THEN CAME THE SHOCK HE WAS AWAITING, AND IT AT ONCE DETERMINED HIM. WHEN HE UNLOCKED HIS DOOR AND WENT OUT TO HIS HOUSEHOLD AT ELEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK THEY TOLD HIM THAT THE RUNAWAY CONVICT AND BRIGAND, FEDKA, WHO WAS A TERROR TO EVERY ONE, WHO HAD PILLAGED CHURCHES AND ONLY LATELY BEEN GUILTY OF MURDER AND ARSON, WHO WAS BEING PURSUED AND COULD NOT BE CAPTURED BY OUR POLICE, HAD BEEN FOUND AT DAYBREAK MURDERED, FIVE MILES FROM THE TOWN, AT A TURNING OFF THE HIGH ROAD, AND THAT THE WHOLE TOWN WAS TALKING OF IT ALREADY. HE RUSHED HEADLONG OUT OF THE HOUSE AT ONCE TO FIND OUT FURTHER DETAILS, AND LEARNED, TO BEGIN WITH, THAT FEDKA, WHO HAD BEEN FOUND WITH HIS SKULL BROKEN, HAD APPARENTLY BEEN ROBBED AND, SECONDLY, THAT THE POLICE ALREADY HAD STRONG SUSPICION AND EVEN GOOD GROUNDS FOR BELIEVING THAT THE MURDERER WAS ONE OF THE SHPIGULIN MEN CALLED FOMKA, THE VERY ONE WHO HAD BEEN HIS ACCOMPLICE IN MURDERING THE LEBYADKINS AND SETTING FIRE TO THEIR HOUSE, AND THAT THERE HAD BEEN A QUARREL BETWEEN THEM ON THE ROAD ABOUT A LARGE SUM OF MONEY STOLEN FROM LEBYADKIN, WHICH FEDKA WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE HIDDEN. LIPUTIN RAN TO PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS LODGINGS AND SUCCEEDED IN LEARNING AT THE BACK DOOR, ON THE SLY, THAT THOUGH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD NOT RETURNED HOME TILL ABOUT ONE O‚ÄÔCLOCK AT NIGHT, HE HAD SLEPT THERE QUIETLY ALL NIGHT TILL EIGHT O‚ÄÔCLOCK NEXT MORNING. OF COURSE, THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT FEDKA‚ÄÔS DEATH, AND THAT SUCH CAREERS USUALLY HAVE SUCH AN ENDING; BUT THE COINCIDENCE OF THE FATAL WORDS THAT ‚ÄÚIT WAS THE LAST TIME FEDKA WOULD DRINK VODKA,‚ÄÙ WITH THE PROMPT FULFILMENT OF THE PREDICTION, WAS SO REMARKABLE THAT LIPUTIN NO LONGER HESITATED. THE SHOCK HAD BEEN GIVEN; IT WAS AS THOUGH A STONE HAD FALLEN UPON HIM AND CRUSHED HIM FOREVER. RETURNING HOME, HE THRUST HIS TRAVELLING-BAG UNDER THE BED WITHOUT A WORD, AND IN THE EVENING AT THE HOUR FIXED HE WAS THE FIRST TO APPEAR AT THE APPOINTED SPOT TO MEET SHATOV, THOUGH IT‚ÄÔS TRUE HE STILL HAD HIS PASSPORT IN HIS POCKET.





CHAPTER V. A WANDERER

I

THE CATASTROPHE WITH LIZA AND THE DEATH OF MARYA TIMOFYEVNA MADE AN OVERWHELMING IMPRESSION ON SHATOV. I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT THAT MORNING I MET HIM IN PASSING; HE SEEMED TO ME NOT HIMSELF. HE TOLD ME AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT ON THE EVENING BEFORE AT NINE O‚ÄÔCLOCK (THAT IS, THREE HOURS BEFORE THE FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT) HE HAD BEEN AT MARYA TIMOFYEVNA‚ÄÔS. HE WENT IN THE MORNING TO LOOK AT THE CORPSES, BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW GAVE NO EVIDENCE OF ANY SORT THAT MORNING. MEANWHILE, TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY THERE WAS A PERFECT TEMPEST IN HIS SOUL, AND ‚Ä¶ I THINK I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT THERE WAS A MOMENT AT DUSK WHEN HE WANTED TO GET UP, GO OUT AND TELL EVERYTHING. WHAT THAT EVERYTHING WAS, NO ONE BUT HE COULD SAY. OF COURSE HE WOULD HAVE ACHIEVED NOTHING, AND WOULD HAVE SIMPLY BETRAYED HIMSELF. HE HAD NO PROOFS WHATEVER WITH WHICH TO CONVICT THE PERPETRATORS OF THE CRIME, AND, INDEED, HE HAD NOTHING BUT VAGUE CONJECTURES TO GO UPON, THOUGH TO HIM THEY AMOUNTED TO COMPLETE CERTAINTY. BUT HE WAS READY TO RUIN HIMSELF IF HE COULD ONLY ‚ÄÚCRUSH THE SCOUNDRELS‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎHIS OWN WORDS. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD GUESSED FAIRLY CORRECTLY AT THIS IMPULSE IN HIM, AND HE KNEW HIMSELF THAT HE WAS RISKING A GREAT DEAL IN PUTTING OFF THE EXECUTION OF HIS NEW AWFUL PROJECT TILL NEXT DAY. ON HIS SIDE THERE WAS, AS USUAL, GREAT SELF-CONFIDENCE AND CONTEMPT FOR ALL THESE ‚ÄÚWRETCHED CREATURES‚ÄÙ AND FOR SHATOV IN PARTICULAR. HE HAD FOR YEARS DESPISED SHATOV FOR HIS ‚ÄÚWHINING IDIOCY,‚ÄÙ AS HE HAD EXPRESSED IT IN FORMER DAYS ABROAD, AND HE WAS ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT THAT HE COULD DEAL WITH SUCH A GUILELESS CREATURE, THAT IS, KEEP AN EYE ON HIM ALL THAT DAY, AND PUT A CHECK ON HIM AT THE FIRST SIGN OF DANGER. YET WHAT SAVED ‚ÄÚTHE SCOUNDRELS‚ÄÙ FOR A SHORT TIME WAS SOMETHING QUITE UNEXPECTED WHICH THEY HAD NOT FORESEEN.‚Ä¶

TOWARDS EIGHT O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE EVENING (AT THE VERY TIME WHEN THE QUINTET WAS MEETING AT ERKEL‚ÄÔS, AND WAITING IN INDIGNATION AND EXCITEMENT FOR PYOTR STEPANOVITCH) SHATOV WAS LYING IN THE DARK ON HIS BED WITH A HEADACHE AND A SLIGHT CHILL; HE WAS TORTURED BY UNCERTAINTY, HE WAS ANGRY, HE KEPT MAKING UP HIS MIND, AND COULD NOT MAKE IT UP FINALLY, AND FELT, WITH A CURSE, THAT IT WOULD ALL LEAD TO NOTHING. GRADUALLY HE SANK INTO A BRIEF DOZE AND HAD SOMETHING LIKE A NIGHTMARE. HE DREAMT THAT HE WAS LYING ON HIS BED, TIED UP WITH CORDS AND UNABLE TO STIR, AND MEANTIME HE HEARD A TERRIBLE BANGING THAT ECHOED ALL OVER THE HOUSE, A BANGING ON THE FENCE, AT THE GATE, AT HIS DOOR, IN KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS LODGE, SO THAT THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS SHAKING, AND A FAR-AWAY FAMILIAR VOICE THAT WRUNG HIS HEART WAS CALLING TO HIM PITEOUSLY. HE SUDDENLY WOKE AND SAT UP IN BED. TO HIS SURPRISE THE BANGING AT THE GATE WENT ON, THOUGH NOT NEARLY SO VIOLENT AS IT HAD SEEMED IN HIS DREAM. THE KNOCKS WERE REPEATED AND PERSISTENT, AND THE STRANGE VOICE ‚ÄÚTHAT WRUNG HIS HEART‚ÄÙ COULD STILL BE HEARD BELOW AT THE GATE, THOUGH NOT PITEOUSLY BUT ANGRILY AND IMPATIENTLY, ALTERNATING WITH ANOTHER VOICE, MORE RESTRAINED AND ORDINARY. HE JUMPED UP, OPENED THE CASEMENT PANE AND PUT HIS HEAD OUT.

‚ÄÚWHO‚ÄÔS THERE?‚ÄÙ HE CALLED, LITERALLY NUMB WITH TERROR.

‚ÄÚIF YOU ARE SHATOV,‚ÄÙ THE ANSWER CAME HARSHLY AND RESOLUTELY FROM BELOW, ‚ÄÚBE SO GOOD AS TO TELL ME STRAIGHT OUT AND HONESTLY WHETHER YOU AGREE TO LET ME IN OR NOT?‚ÄÙ

IT WAS TRUE: HE RECOGNISED THE VOICE!

‚ÄÚMARIE!‚Ä¶ IS IT YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, YES, MARYA SHATOV, AND I ASSURE YOU I CAN‚ÄÔT KEEP THE DRIVER A MINUTE LONGER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHIS MINUTE ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔLL GET A CANDLE,‚ÄÙ SHATOV CRIED FAINTLY. THEN HE RUSHED TO LOOK FOR THE MATCHES. THE MATCHES, AS ALWAYS HAPPENS AT SUCH MOMENTS, COULD NOT BE FOUND. HE DROPPED THE CANDLESTICK AND THE CANDLE ON THE FLOOR AND AS SOON AS HE HEARD THE IMPATIENT VOICE FROM BELOW AGAIN, HE ABANDONED THE SEARCH AND DASHED DOWN THE STEEP STAIRS TO OPEN THE GATE.

‚ÄÚBE SO GOOD AS TO HOLD THE BAG WHILE I SETTLE WITH THIS BLOCKHEAD,‚ÄÙ WAS HOW MADAME MARYA SHATOV GREETED HIM BELOW, AND SHE THRUST INTO HIS HANDS A RATHER LIGHT CHEAP CANVAS HANDBAG STUDDED WITH BRASS NAILS, OF DRESDEN MANUFACTURE. SHE ATTACKED THE DRIVER WITH EXASPERATION.

‚ÄÚALLOW ME TO TELL YOU, YOU ARE ASKING TOO MUCH. IF YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN DRIVING ME FOR AN EXTRA HOUR THROUGH THESE FILTHY STREETS, THAT‚ÄÔS YOUR FAULT, BECAUSE IT SEEMS YOU DIDN‚ÄÔT KNOW WHERE TO FIND THIS STUPID STREET AND IMBECILE HOUSE. TAKE YOUR THIRTY KOPECKS AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND THAT YOU‚ÄÔLL GET NOTHING MORE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚECH, LADY, YOU TOLD ME YOURSELF VOZNESENSKY STREET AND THIS IS BOGOYAVLENSKY; VOZNESENSKY IS EVER SO FAR AWAY. YOU‚ÄÔVE SIMPLY PUT THE HORSE INTO A STEAM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚVOZNESENSKY, BOGOYAVLENSKY‚ÄÎYOU OUGHT TO KNOW ALL THOSE STUPID NAMES BETTER THAN I DO, AS YOU ARE AN INHABITANT; BESIDES, YOU ARE UNFAIR, I TOLD YOU FIRST OF ALL FILIPOV‚ÄÔS HOUSE AND YOU DECLARED YOU KNEW IT. IN ANY CASE YOU CAN HAVE ME UP TO-MORROW IN THE LOCAL COURT, BUT NOW I BEG YOU TO LET ME ALONE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHERE, HERE‚ÄÔS ANOTHER FIVE KOPECKS.‚ÄÙ WITH EAGER HASTE SHATOV PULLED A FIVE-KOPECK PIECE OUT OF HIS POCKET AND GAVE IT TO THE DRIVER.

‚ÄÚDO ME A FAVOUR, I BEG YOU, DON‚ÄÔT DARE TO DO THAT!‚ÄÙ MADAME SHATOV FLARED UP, BUT THE DRIVER DROVE OFF AND SHATOV, TAKING HER HAND, DREW HER THROUGH THE GATE.

‚ÄÚMAKE HASTE, MARIE, MAKE HASTE ‚Ä¶ THAT‚ÄÔS NO MATTER, AND ‚Ä¶ YOU ARE WET THROUGH. TAKE CARE, WE GO UP HERE‚ÄÎHOW SORRY I AM THERE‚ÄÔS NO LIGHT‚ÄÎTHE STAIRS ARE STEEP, HOLD TIGHT, HOLD TIGHT! WELL, THIS IS MY ROOM. EXCUSE MY HAVING NO LIGHT ‚Ä¶ ONE MINUTE!‚ÄÙ

HE PICKED UP THE CANDLESTICK BUT IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE THE MATCHES WERE FOUND. MADAME SHATOV STOOD WAITING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM, SILENT AND MOTIONLESS.

‚ÄÚTHANK GOD, HERE THEY ARE AT LAST!‚ÄÙ HE CRIED JOYFULLY, LIGHTING UP THE ROOM. MARYA SHATOV TOOK A CURSORY SURVEY OF HIS ABODE.

‚ÄÚTHEY TOLD ME YOU LIVED IN A POOR WAY, BUT I DIDN‚ÄÔT EXPECT IT TO BE AS BAD AS THIS,‚ÄÙ SHE PRONOUNCED WITH AN AIR OF DISGUST, AND SHE MOVED TOWARDS THE BED.

‚ÄÚOH, I AM TIRED!‚ÄÙ SHE SAT DOWN ON THE HARD BED, WITH AN EXHAUSTED AIR. ‚ÄÚPLEASE PUT DOWN THE BAG AND SIT DOWN ON THE CHAIR YOURSELF. JUST AS YOU LIKE THOUGH; YOU ARE IN THE WAY STANDING THERE. I HAVE COME TO YOU FOR A TIME, TILL I CAN GET WORK, BECAUSE I KNOW NOTHING OF THIS PLACE AND I HAVE NO MONEY. BUT IF I SHALL BE IN YOUR WAY I BEG YOU AGAIN, BE SO GOOD AS TO TELL ME SO AT ONCE, AS YOU ARE BOUND TO DO IF YOU ARE AN HONEST MAN. I COULD SELL SOMETHING TO-MORROW AND PAY FOR A ROOM AT AN HOTEL, BUT YOU MUST TAKE ME TO THE HOTEL YOURSELF.‚Ä¶ OH, BUT I AM TIRED!‚ÄÙ

SHATOV WAS ALL OF A TREMOR.

‚ÄÚYOU MUSTN‚ÄÔT, MARIE, YOU MUSTN‚ÄÔT GO TO AN HOTEL! AN HOTEL! WHAT FOR? WHAT FOR?‚ÄÙ

HE CLASPED HIS HANDS IMPLORINGLY.‚Ä¶

‚ÄÚWELL, IF I CAN GET ON WITHOUT THE HOTEL ‚Ä¶ I MUST, ANY WAY, EXPLAIN THE POSITION. REMEMBER, SHATOV, THAT WE LIVED IN GENEVA AS MAN AND WIFE FOR A FORTNIGHT AND A FEW DAYS; IT‚ÄÔS THREE YEARS SINCE WE PARTED, WITHOUT ANY PARTICULAR QUARREL THOUGH. BUT DON‚ÄÔT IMAGINE THAT I‚ÄÔVE COME BACK TO RENEW ANY OF THE FOOLISHNESS OF THE PAST. I‚ÄÔVE COME BACK TO LOOK FOR WORK, AND THAT I‚ÄÔVE COME STRAIGHT TO THIS TOWN IS JUST BECAUSE IT‚ÄÔS ALL THE SAME TO ME. I‚ÄÔVE NOT COME TO SAY I AM SORRY FOR ANYTHING; PLEASE DON‚ÄÔT IMAGINE ANYTHING SO STUPID AS THAT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, MARIE! THIS IS UNNECESSARY, QUITE UNNECESSARY,‚ÄÙ SHATOV MUTTERED VAGUELY.

‚ÄÚIF SO, IF YOU ARE SO FAR DEVELOPED AS TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT, I MAY ALLOW MYSELF TO ADD, THAT IF I‚ÄÔVE COME STRAIGHT TO YOU NOW AND AM IN YOUR LODGING, IT‚ÄÔS PARTLY BECAUSE I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU WERE FAR FROM BEING A SCOUNDREL AND WERE PERHAPS MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER ‚Ä¶ BLACKGUARDS!‚ÄÙ

HER EYES FLASHED. SHE MUST HAVE HAD TO BEAR A GREAT DEAL AT THE HANDS OF SOME ‚ÄÚBLACKGUARDS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND PLEASE BELIEVE ME, I WASN‚ÄÔT LAUGHING AT YOU JUST NOW WHEN I TOLD YOU YOU WERE GOOD. I SPOKE PLAINLY, WITHOUT FINE PHRASES AND I CAN‚ÄÔT ENDURE THEM. BUT THAT‚ÄÔS ALL NONSENSE. I ALWAYS HOPED YOU WOULD HAVE SENSE ENOUGH NOT TO PESTER ME.‚Ä¶ ENOUGH, I AM TIRED.‚ÄÙ

AND SHE BENT ON HIM A LONG, HARASSED AND WEARY GAZE. SHATOV STOOD FACING HER AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM, WHICH WAS FIVE PACES AWAY, AND LISTENED TO HER TIMIDLY WITH A LOOK OF NEW LIFE AND UNWONTED RADIANCE ON HIS FACE. THIS STRONG, RUGGED MAN, ALL BRISTLES ON THE SURFACE, WAS SUDDENLY ALL SOFTNESS AND SHINING GLADNESS. THERE WAS A THRILL OF EXTRAORDINARY AND UNEXPECTED FEELING IN HIS SOUL. THREE YEARS OF SEPARATION, THREE YEARS OF THE BROKEN MARRIAGE HAD EFFACED NOTHING FROM HIS HEART. AND PERHAPS EVERY DAY DURING THOSE THREE YEARS HE HAD DREAMED OF HER, OF THAT BELOVED BEING WHO HAD ONCE SAID TO HIM, ‚ÄÚI LOVE YOU.‚ÄÙ KNOWING SHATOV I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT HE COULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED HIMSELF EVEN TO DREAM THAT A WOMAN MIGHT SAY TO HIM, ‚ÄÚI LOVE YOU.‚ÄÙ HE WAS SAVAGELY MODEST AND CHASTE, HE LOOKED ON HIMSELF AS A PERFECT MONSTER, DETESTED HIS OWN FACE AS WELL AS HIS CHARACTER, COMPARED HIMSELF TO SOME FREAK ONLY FIT TO BE EXHIBITED AT FAIRS. CONSEQUENTLY HE VALUED HONESTY ABOVE EVERYTHING AND WAS FANATICALLY DEVOTED TO HIS CONVICTIONS; HE WAS GLOOMY, PROUD, EASILY MOVED TO WRATH, AND SPARING OF WORDS. BUT HERE WAS THE ONE BEING WHO HAD LOVED HIM FOR A FORTNIGHT (THAT HE HAD NEVER DOUBTED, NEVER!), A BEING HE HAD ALWAYS CONSIDERED IMMEASURABLY ABOVE HIM IN SPITE OF HIS PERFECTLY SOBER UNDERSTANDING OF HER ERRORS; A BEING TO WHOM HE COULD FORGIVE EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING (OF THAT THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION; INDEED IT WAS QUITE THE OTHER WAY, HIS IDEA WAS THAT HE WAS ENTIRELY TO BLAME); THIS WOMAN, THIS MARYA SHATOV, WAS IN HIS HOUSE, IN HIS PRESENCE AGAIN ‚Ä¶ IT WAS ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE! HE WAS SO OVERCOME, THERE WAS SO MUCH THAT WAS TERRIBLE AND AT THE SAME TIME SO MUCH HAPPINESS IN THIS EVENT THAT HE COULD NOT, PERHAPS WOULD NOT‚ÄÎPERHAPS WAS AFRAID TO‚ÄÎREALISE THE POSITION. IT WAS A DREAM. BUT WHEN SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH THAT HARASSED GAZE HE SUDDENLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WOMAN HE LOVED SO DEARLY WAS SUFFERING, PERHAPS HAD BEEN WRONGED. HIS HEART WENT COLD. HE LOOKED AT HER FEATURES WITH ANGUISH: THE FIRST BLOOM OF YOUTH HAD LONG FADED FROM THIS EXHAUSTED FACE. IT‚ÄÔS TRUE THAT SHE WAS STILL GOOD-LOOKING‚ÄÎIN HIS EYES A BEAUTY, AS SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN. IN REALITY SHE WAS A WOMAN OF TWENTY-FIVE, RATHER STRONGLY BUILT, ABOVE THE MEDIUM HEIGHT (TALLER THAN SHATOV), WITH ABUNDANT DARK BROWN HAIR, A PALE OVAL FACE, AND LARGE DARK EYES NOW GLITTERING WITH FEVERISH BRILLIANCE. BUT THE LIGHT-HEARTED, NA√ØVE AND GOOD-NATURED ENERGY HE HAD KNOWN SO WELL IN THE PAST WAS REPLACED NOW BY A SULLEN IRRITABILITY AND DISILLUSIONMENT, A SORT OF CYNICISM WHICH WAS NOT YET HABITUAL TO HER HERSELF, AND WHICH WEIGHED UPON HER. BUT THE CHIEF THING WAS THAT SHE WAS ILL, THAT HE COULD SEE CLEARLY. IN SPITE OF THE AWE IN WHICH HE STOOD OF HER HE SUDDENLY WENT UP TO HER AND TOOK HER BY BOTH HANDS.

‚ÄÚMARIE ‚Ä¶ YOU KNOW ‚Ä¶ YOU ARE VERY TIRED, PERHAPS, FOR GOD‚ÄÔS SAKE, DON‚ÄÔT BE ANGRY.‚Ä¶ IF YOU‚ÄÔD CONSENT TO HAVE SOME TEA, FOR INSTANCE, EH? TEA PICKS ONE UP SO, DOESN‚ÄÔT IT? IF YOU‚ÄÔD CONSENT!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY TALK ABOUT CONSENTING! OF COURSE I CONSENT, WHAT A BABY YOU ARE STILL. GET ME SOME IF YOU CAN. HOW CRAMPED YOU ARE HERE. HOW COLD IT IS!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, I‚ÄÔLL GET SOME LOGS FOR THE FIRE DIRECTLY, SOME LOGS ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔVE GOT LOGS.‚ÄÙ SHATOV WAS ALL ASTIR. ‚ÄÚLOGS ‚Ä¶ THAT IS ‚Ä¶ BUT I‚ÄÔLL GET TEA DIRECTLY,‚ÄÙ HE WAVED HIS HAND AS THOUGH WITH DESPERATE DETERMINATION AND SNATCHED UP HIS CAP.

‚ÄÚWHERE ARE YOU GOING? SO YOU‚ÄÔVE NO TEA IN THE HOUSE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHERE SHALL BE, THERE SHALL BE, THERE SHALL BE, THERE SHALL BE EVERYTHING DIRECTLY.‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HE TOOK HIS REVOLVER FROM THE SHELF, ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL SELL THIS REVOLVER DIRECTLY ‚Ä¶ OR PAWN IT.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT FOOLISHNESS AND WHAT A TIME THAT WILL TAKE! TAKE MY MONEY IF YOU‚ÄÔVE NOTHING, THERE‚ÄÔS EIGHTY KOPECKS HERE, I THINK; THAT‚ÄÔS ALL I HAVE. THIS IS LIKE A MADHOUSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT WANT YOUR MONEY, I DON‚ÄÔT WANT IT I‚ÄÔLL BE HERE DIRECTLY, IN ONE INSTANT. I CAN MANAGE WITHOUT THE REVOLVER.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

AND HE RUSHED STRAIGHT TO KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS. THIS WAS PROBABLY TWO HOURS BEFORE THE VISIT OF PYOTR STEPANOVITCH AND LIPUTIN TO KIRILLOV. THOUGH SHATOV AND KIRILLOV LIVED IN THE SAME YARD THEY HARDLY EVER SAW EACH OTHER, AND WHEN THEY MET THEY DID NOT NOD OR SPEAK: THEY HAD BEEN TOO LONG ‚ÄÚLYING SIDE BY SIDE‚ÄÙ IN AMERICA.‚Ä¶

‚ÄÚKIRILLOV, YOU ALWAYS HAVE TEA; HAVE YOU GOT TEA AND A SAMOVAR?‚ÄÙ

KIRILLOV, WHO WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE ROOM, AS HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF DOING ALL NIGHT, STOPPED AND LOOKED INTENTLY AT HIS HURRIED VISITOR, THOUGH WITHOUT MUCH SURPRISE.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE GOT TEA AND SUGAR AND A SAMOVAR. BUT THERE‚ÄÔS NO NEED OF THE SAMOVAR, THE TEA IS HOT. SIT DOWN AND SIMPLY DRINK IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚKIRILLOV, WE LAY SIDE BY SIDE IN AMERICA.‚Ä¶ MY WIFE HAS COME TO ME ‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶ GIVE ME THE TEA.‚Ä¶ I SHALL WANT THE SAMOVAR.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF YOUR WIFE IS HERE YOU WANT THE SAMOVAR. BUT TAKE IT LATER. I‚ÄÔVE TWO. AND NOW TAKE THE TEAPOT FROM THE TABLE. IT‚ÄÔS HOT, BOILING HOT. TAKE EVERYTHING, TAKE THE SUGAR, ALL OF IT. BREAD ‚Ä¶ THERE‚ÄÔS PLENTY OF BREAD; ALL OF IT. THERE‚ÄÔS SOME VEAL. I‚ÄÔVE A ROUBLE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGIVE IT ME, FRIEND, I‚ÄÔLL PAY IT BACK TO-MORROW! ACH, KIRILLOV!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIS IT THE SAME WIFE WHO WAS IN SWITZERLAND? THAT‚ÄÔS A GOOD THING. AND YOUR RUNNING IN LIKE THIS, THAT‚ÄÔS A GOOD THING TOO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚKIRILLOV!‚ÄÙ CRIED SHATOV, TAKING THE TEAPOT UNDER HIS ARM AND CARRYING THE BREAD AND SUGAR IN BOTH HANDS. ‚ÄÚKIRILLOV, IF ‚Ä¶ IF YOU COULD GET RID OF YOUR DREADFUL FANCIES AND GIVE UP YOUR ATHEISTIC RAVINGS ‚Ä¶ OH, WHAT A MAN YOU‚ÄÔD BE, KIRILLOV!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚONE CAN SEE YOU LOVE YOUR WIFE AFTER SWITZERLAND. IT‚ÄÔS A GOOD THING YOU DO‚ÄÎAFTER SWITZERLAND. WHEN YOU WANT TEA, COME AGAIN. YOU CAN COME ALL NIGHT, I DON‚ÄÔT SLEEP AT ALL. THERE‚ÄÔLL BE A SAMOVAR. TAKE THE ROUBLE, HERE IT IS. GO TO YOUR WIFE, I‚ÄÔLL STAY HERE AND THINK ABOUT YOU AND YOUR WIFE.‚ÄÙ

MARYA SHATOV WAS UNMISTAKABLY PLEASED AT HER HUSBAND‚ÄÔS HASTE AND FELL UPON THE TEA ALMOST GREEDILY, BUT THERE WAS NO NEED TO RUN FOR THE SAMOVAR; SHE DRANK ONLY HALF A CUP AND SWALLOWED A TINY PIECE OF BREAD. THE VEAL SHE REFUSED WITH DISGUST AND IRRITATION.

‚ÄÚYOU ARE ILL, MARIE, ALL THIS IS A SIGN OF ILLNESS,‚ÄÙ SHATOV REMARKED TIMIDLY AS HE WAITED UPON HER.

‚ÄÚOF COURSE I‚ÄÔM ILL, PLEASE SIT DOWN. WHERE DID YOU GET THE TEA IF YOU HAVEN‚ÄÔT ANY?‚ÄÙ

SHATOV TOLD HER ABOUT KIRILLOV BRIEFLY. SHE HAD HEARD SOMETHING OF HIM.

‚ÄÚI KNOW HE IS MAD; SAY NO MORE, PLEASE; THERE ARE PLENTY OF FOOLS. SO YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN IN AMERICA? I HEARD, YOU WROTE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, I ‚Ä¶ I WROTE TO YOU IN PARIS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚENOUGH, PLEASE TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE. ARE YOU A SLAVOPHIL IN YOUR CONVICTIONS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI ‚Ä¶ I AM NOT EXACTLY.‚Ä¶ SINCE I CANNOT BE A RUSSIAN, I BECAME A SLAVOPHIL.‚ÄÙ HE SMILED A WRY SMILE WITH THE EFFORT OF ONE WHO FEELS HE HAS MADE A STRAINED AND INAPPROPRIATE JEST.

‚ÄÚWHY, AREN‚ÄÔT YOU A RUSSIAN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, I‚ÄÔM NOT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, THAT‚ÄÔS ALL FOOLISHNESS. DO SIT DOWN, I ENTREAT YOU. WHY ARE YOU ALL OVER THE PLACE? DO YOU THINK I AM LIGHTHEADED? PERHAPS I SHALL BE. YOU SAY THERE ARE ONLY YOU TWO IN THE HOUSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES.‚Ä¶ DOWNSTAIRS ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND BOTH SUCH CLEVER PEOPLE. WHAT IS THERE DOWNSTAIRS? YOU SAID DOWNSTAIRS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, NOTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY NOTHING? I WANT TO KNOW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI ONLY MEANT TO SAY THAT NOW WE ARE ONLY TWO IN THE YARD, BUT THAT THE LEBYADKINS USED TO LIVE DOWNSTAIRS.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT WOMAN WHO WAS MURDERED LAST NIGHT?‚ÄÙ SHE STARTED SUDDENLY. ‚ÄÚI HEARD OF IT. I HEARD OF IT AS SOON AS I ARRIVED. THERE WAS A FIRE HERE, WASN‚ÄÔT THERE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, MARIE, YES, AND PERHAPS I AM DOING A SCOUNDRELLY THING THIS MOMENT IN FORGIVING THE SCOUNDRELS.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HE STOOD UP SUDDENLY AND PACED ABOUT THE ROOM, RAISING HIS ARMS AS THOUGH IN A FRENZY.

BUT MARIE HAD NOT QUITE UNDERSTOOD HIM. SHE HEARD HIS ANSWERS INATTENTIVELY; SHE ASKED QUESTIONS BUT DID NOT LISTEN.

‚ÄÚFINE THINGS ARE BEING DONE AMONG YOU! OH, HOW CONTEMPTIBLE IT ALL IS! WHAT SCOUNDRELS MEN ALL ARE! BUT DO SIT DOWN, I BEG YOU, OH, HOW YOU EXASPERATE ME!‚ÄÙ AND SHE LET HER HEAD SINK ON THE PILLOW, EXHAUSTED.

‚ÄÚMARIE, I WON‚ÄÔT.‚Ä¶ PERHAPS YOU‚ÄÔLL LIE DOWN, MARIE?‚ÄÙ SHE MADE NO ANSWER AND CLOSED HER EYES HELPLESSLY. HER PALE FACE LOOKED DEATH-LIKE. SHE FELL ASLEEP ALMOST INSTANTLY. SHATOV LOOKED ROUND, SNUFFED THE CANDLE, LOOKED UNEASILY AT HER FACE ONCE MORE, PRESSED HIS HANDS TIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM AND WALKED ON TIPTOE OUT OF THE ROOM INTO THE PASSAGE. AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS HE STOOD IN THE CORNER WITH HIS FACE TO THE WALL AND REMAINED SO FOR TEN MINUTES WITHOUT SOUND OR MOVEMENT. HE WOULD HAVE STOOD THERE LONGER, BUT HE SUDDENLY CAUGHT THE SOUND OF SOFT CAUTIOUS STEPS BELOW. SOMEONE WAS COMING UP THE STAIRS. SHATOV REMEMBERED HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO FASTEN THE GATE.

‚ÄÚWHO‚ÄÔS THERE?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED IN A WHISPER. THE UNKNOWN VISITOR WENT ON SLOWLY MOUNTING THE STAIRS WITHOUT ANSWERING. WHEN HE REACHED THE TOP HE STOOD STILL; IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE HIS FACE IN THE DARK; SUDDENLY SHATOV HEARD THE CAUTIOUS QUESTION:

‚ÄÚIVAN SHATOV?‚ÄÙ

SHATOV SAID WHO HE WAS, BUT AT ONCE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO CHECK HIS ADVANCE. THE LATTER TOOK HIS HAND, AND SHATOV SHUDDERED AS THOUGH HE HAD TOUCHED SOME TERRIBLE REPTILE.

‚ÄÚSTAND HERE,‚ÄÙ HE WHISPERED QUICKLY. ‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT GO IN, I CAN‚ÄÔT RECEIVE YOU JUST NOW. MY WIFE HAS COME BACK. I‚ÄÔLL FETCH THE CANDLE.‚ÄÙ

WHEN HE RETURNED WITH THE CANDLE HE FOUND A YOUNG OFFICER STANDING THERE; HE DID NOT KNOW HIS NAME BUT HE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE.

‚ÄÚERKEL,‚ÄÙ SAID THE LAD, INTRODUCING HIMSELF. ‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE SEEN ME AT VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI REMEMBER; YOU SAT WRITING. LISTEN,‚ÄÙ SAID SHATOV IN SUDDEN EXCITEMENT, GOING UP TO HIM FRANTICALLY, BUT STILL TALKING IN A WHISPER. ‚ÄÚYOU GAVE ME A SIGN JUST NOW WHEN YOU TOOK MY HAND. BUT YOU KNOW I CAN TREAT ALL THESE SIGNALS WITH CONTEMPT! I DON‚ÄÔT ACKNOWLEDGE THEM.‚Ä¶ I DON‚ÄÔT WANT THEM.‚Ä¶ I CAN THROW YOU DOWNSTAIRS THIS MINUTE, DO YOU KNOW THAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT AND I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE IN SUCH A RAGE ABOUT,‚ÄÙ THE VISITOR ANSWERED WITHOUT MALICE AND ALMOST INGENUOUSLY. ‚ÄÚI HAVE ONLY TO GIVE YOU A MESSAGE, AND THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT I‚ÄÔVE COME FOR, BEING PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS NOT TO LOSE TIME. YOU HAVE A PRINTING PRESS WHICH DOES NOT BELONG TO YOU, AND OF WHICH YOU ARE BOUND TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT, AS YOU KNOW YOURSELF. I HAVE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS TO REQUEST YOU TO GIVE IT UP TO-MORROW AT SEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE EVENING TO LIPUTIN. I HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO TELL YOU ALSO THAT NOTHING MORE WILL BE ASKED OF YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOTHING?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚABSOLUTELY NOTHING. YOUR REQUEST IS GRANTED, AND YOU ARE STRUCK OFF OUR LIST. I WAS INSTRUCTED TO TELL YOU THAT POSITIVELY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHO INSTRUCTED YOU TO TELL ME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHOSE WHO TOLD ME THE SIGN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHAVE YOU COME FROM ABROAD?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI ‚Ä¶ I THINK THAT‚ÄÔS NO MATTER TO YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, HANG IT! WHY DIDN‚ÄÔT YOU COME BEFORE IF YOU WERE TOLD TO?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI FOLLOWED CERTAIN INSTRUCTIONS AND WAS NOT ALONE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI UNDERSTAND, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WERE NOT ALONE. EH ‚Ä¶ HANG IT! BUT WHY DIDN‚ÄÔT LIPUTIN COME HIMSELF?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSO I SHALL COME FOR YOU TO-MORROW AT EXACTLY SIX O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE EVENING, AND WE‚ÄÔLL GO THERE ON FOOT. THERE WILL BE NO ONE THERE BUT US THREE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWILL VERHOVENSKY BE THERE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, HE WON‚ÄÔT. VERHOVENSKY IS LEAVING THE TOWN AT ELEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK TO-MORROW MORNING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚJUST WHAT I THOUGHT!‚ÄÙ SHATOV WHISPERED FURIOUSLY, AND HE STRUCK HIS FIST ON HIS HIP. ‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS RUN OFF, THE SNEAK!‚ÄÙ

HE SANK INTO AGITATED REFLECTION. ERKEL LOOKED INTENTLY AT HIM AND WAITED IN SILENCE.

‚ÄÚBUT HOW WILL YOU TAKE IT? YOU CAN‚ÄÔT SIMPLY PICK IT UP IN YOUR HANDS AND CARRY IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHERE WILL BE NO NEED TO. YOU‚ÄÔLL SIMPLY POINT OUT THE PLACE AND WE‚ÄÔLL JUST MAKE SURE THAT IT REALLY IS BURIED THERE. WE ONLY KNOW WHEREABOUTS THE PLACE IS, WE DON‚ÄÔT KNOW THE PLACE ITSELF. AND HAVE YOU POINTED THE PLACE OUT TO ANYONE ELSE YET?‚ÄÙ

SHATOV LOOKED AT HIM.

‚ÄÚYOU, YOU, A CHIT OF A BOY LIKE YOU, A SILLY BOY LIKE YOU, YOU TOO HAVE GOT CAUGHT IN THAT NET LIKE A SHEEP? YES, THAT‚ÄÔS JUST THE YOUNG BLOOD THEY WANT! WELL, GO ALONG. E-ECH! THAT SCOUNDREL‚ÄÔS TAKEN YOU ALL IN AND RUN AWAY.‚ÄÙ

ERKEL LOOKED AT HIM SERENELY AND CALMLY BUT DID NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND.

‚ÄÚVERHOVENSKY, VERHOVENSKY HAS RUN AWAY!‚ÄÙ SHATOV GROWLED FIERCELY.

‚ÄÚBUT HE IS STILL HERE, HE IS NOT GONE AWAY. HE IS NOT GOING TILL TO-MORROW,‚ÄÙ ERKEL OBSERVED SOFTLY AND PERSUASIVELY. ‚ÄÚI PARTICULARLY BEGGED HIM TO BE PRESENT AS A WITNESS; MY INSTRUCTIONS ALL REFERRED TO HIM (HE EXPLAINED FRANKLY LIKE A YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED BOY). BUT I REGRET TO SAY HE DID NOT AGREE ON THE GROUND OF HIS DEPARTURE, AND HE REALLY IS IN A HURRY.‚ÄÙ

SHATOV GLANCED COMPASSIONATELY AT THE SIMPLE YOUTH AGAIN, BUT SUDDENLY GAVE A GESTURE OF DESPAIR AS THOUGH HE THOUGHT ‚ÄÚTHEY ARE NOT WORTH PITYING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚALL RIGHT, I‚ÄÔLL COME,‚ÄÙ HE CUT HIM SHORT. ‚ÄÚAND NOW GET AWAY, BE OFF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSO I‚ÄÔLL COME FOR YOU AT SIX O‚ÄÔCLOCK PUNCTUALLY.‚ÄÙ ERKEL MADE A COURTEOUS BOW AND WALKED DELIBERATELY DOWNSTAIRS.

‚ÄÚLITTLE FOOL!‚ÄÙ SHATOV COULD NOT HELP SHOUTING AFTER HIM FROM THE TOP.

‚ÄÚWHAT IS IT?‚ÄÙ RESPONDED THE LAD FROM THE BOTTOM.

‚ÄÚNOTHING, YOU CAN GO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI THOUGHT YOU SAID SOMETHING.‚ÄÙ

II

ERKEL WAS A ‚ÄÚLITTLE FOOL‚ÄÙ WHO WAS ONLY LACKING IN THE HIGHER FORM OF REASON, THE RULING POWER OF THE INTELLECT; BUT OF THE LESSER, THE SUBORDINATE REASONING FACULTIES, HE HAD PLENTY‚ÄÎEVEN TO THE POINT OF CUNNING. FANATICALLY, CHILDISHLY DEVOTED TO ‚ÄÚTHE CAUSE‚ÄÙ OR RATHER IN REALITY TO PYOTR VERHOVENSKY, HE ACTED ON THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO HIM WHEN AT THE MEETING OF THE QUINTET THEY HAD AGREED AND HAD DISTRIBUTED THE VARIOUS DUTIES FOR THE NEXT DAY. WHEN PYOTR STEPANOVITCH GAVE HIM THE JOB OF MESSENGER, HE SUCCEEDED IN TALKING TO HIM ASIDE FOR TEN MINUTES.

A CRAVING FOR ACTIVE SERVICE WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS SHALLOW, UNREFLECTING NATURE, WHICH WAS FOREVER YEARNING TO FOLLOW THE LEAD OF ANOTHER MAN‚ÄÔS WILL, OF COURSE FOR THE GOOD OF ‚ÄÚTHE COMMON‚ÄÙ OR ‚ÄÚTHE GREAT‚ÄÙ CAUSE. NOT THAT THAT MADE ANY DIFFERENCE, FOR LITTLE FANATICS LIKE ERKEL CAN NEVER IMAGINE SERVING A CAUSE EXCEPT BY IDENTIFYING IT WITH THE PERSON WHO, TO THEIR MINDS, IS THE EXPRESSION OF IT. THE SENSITIVE, AFFECTIONATE AND KIND-HEARTED ERKEL WAS PERHAPS THE MOST CALLOUS OF SHATOV‚ÄÔS WOULD-BE MURDERERS, AND, THOUGH HE HAD NO PERSONAL SPITE AGAINST HIM, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PRESENT AT HIS MURDER WITHOUT THE QUIVER OF AN EYELID. HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED, FOR INSTANCE, TO HAVE A GOOD LOOK AT SHATOV‚ÄÔS SURROUNDINGS WHILE CARRYING OUT HIS COMMISSION, AND WHEN SHATOV, RECEIVING HIM AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, BLURTED OUT TO HIM, PROBABLY UNAWARE IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT, THAT HIS WIFE HAD COME BACK TO HIM‚ÄÎERKEL HAD THE INSTINCTIVE CUNNING TO AVOID DISPLAYING THE SLIGHTEST CURIOSITY, THOUGH THE IDEA FLASHED THROUGH HIS MIND THAT THE FACT OF HIS WIFE‚ÄÔS RETURN WAS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR THE SUCCESS OF THEIR UNDERTAKING.

AND SO IT WAS IN REALITY; IT WAS ONLY THAT FACT THAT SAVED THE ‚ÄÚSCOUNDRELS‚ÄÙ FROM SHATOV‚ÄÔS CARRYING OUT HIS INTENTION, AND AT THE SAME TIME HELPED THEM ‚ÄÚTO GET RID OF HIM.‚ÄÙ TO BEGIN WITH, IT AGITATED SHATOV, THREW HIM OUT OF HIS REGULAR ROUTINE, AND DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS USUAL CLEAR-SIGHTEDNESS AND CAUTION. ANY IDEA OF HIS OWN DANGER WOULD BE THE LAST THING TO ENTER HIS HEAD AT THIS MOMENT WHEN HE WAS ABSORBED WITH SUCH DIFFERENT CONSIDERATIONS. ON THE CONTRARY, HE EAGERLY BELIEVED THAT PYOTR VERHOVENSKY WAS RUNNING AWAY THE NEXT DAY: IT FELL IN EXACTLY WITH HIS SUSPICIONS! RETURNING TO THE ROOM HE SAT DOWN AGAIN IN A CORNER, LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES AND HID HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS. BITTER THOUGHTS TORMENTED HIM.‚Ä¶

THEN HE WOULD RAISE HIS HEAD AGAIN AND GO ON TIPTOE TO LOOK AT HER. ‚ÄÚGOOD GOD! SHE WILL BE IN A FEVER BY TO-MORROW MORNING; PERHAPS IT‚ÄÔS BEGUN ALREADY! SHE MUST HAVE CAUGHT COLD. SHE IS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO THIS AWFUL CLIMATE, AND THEN A THIRD-CLASS CARRIAGE, THE STORM, THE RAIN, AND SHE HAS SUCH A THIN LITTLE PELISSE, NO WRAP AT ALL.‚Ä¶ AND TO LEAVE HER LIKE THIS, TO ABANDON HER IN HER HELPLESSNESS! HER BAG, TOO, HER BAG‚ÄÎWHAT A TINY, LIGHT THING, ALL CRUMPLED UP, SCARCELY WEIGHS TEN POUNDS! POOR THING, HOW WORN OUT SHE IS, HOW MUCH SHE‚ÄÔS BEEN THROUGH! SHE IS PROUD, THAT‚ÄÔS WHY SHE WON‚ÄÔT COMPLAIN. BUT SHE IS IRRITABLE, VERY IRRITABLE. IT‚ÄÔS ILLNESS; AN ANGEL WILL GROW IRRITABLE IN ILLNESS. WHAT A DRY FOREHEAD, IT MUST BE HOT‚ÄÎHOW DARK SHE IS UNDER THE EYES, AND ‚Ä¶ AND YET HOW BEAUTIFUL THE OVAL OF HER FACE IS AND HER RICH HAIR, HOW ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

AND HE MADE HASTE TO TURN AWAY HIS EYES, TO WALK AWAY AS THOUGH HE WERE FRIGHTENED AT THE VERY IDEA OF SEEING IN HER ANYTHING BUT AN UNHAPPY, EXHAUSTED FELLOW-CREATURE WHO NEEDED HELP‚ÄÎ‚ÄÚHOW COULD HE THINK OF HOPES, OH, HOW MEAN, HOW BASE IS MAN!‚ÄÙ AND HE WOULD GO BACK TO HIS CORNER, SIT DOWN, HIDE HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS AND AGAIN SINK INTO DREAMS AND REMINISCENCES ‚Ä¶ AND AGAIN HE WAS HAUNTED BY HOPES.

‚ÄÚOH, I AM TIRED, I AM TIRED,‚ÄÙ HE REMEMBERED HER EXCLAMATIONS, HER WEAK BROKEN VOICE. ‚ÄÚGOOD GOD! ABANDON HER NOW, AND SHE HAS ONLY EIGHTY KOPECKS; SHE HELD OUT HER PURSE, A TINY OLD THING! SHE‚ÄÔS COME TO LOOK FOR A JOB. WHAT DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT JOBS? WHAT DO THEY KNOW ABOUT RUSSIA? WHY, THEY ARE LIKE NAUGHTY CHILDREN, THEY‚ÄÔVE NOTHING BUT THEIR OWN FANCIES MADE UP BY THEMSELVES, AND SHE IS ANGRY, POOR THING, THAT RUSSIA IS NOT LIKE THEIR FOREIGN DREAMS! THE LUCKLESS, INNOCENT CREATURES!‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS REALLY COLD HERE, THOUGH.‚ÄÙ

HE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD COMPLAINED, THAT HE HAD PROMISED TO HEAT THE STOVE. ‚ÄÚTHERE ARE LOGS HERE, I CAN FETCH THEM IF ONLY I DON‚ÄÔT WAKE HER. BUT I CAN DO IT WITHOUT WAKING HER. BUT WHAT SHALL I DO ABOUT THE VEAL? WHEN SHE GETS UP PERHAPS SHE WILL BE HUNGRY.‚Ä¶ WELL, THAT WILL DO LATER: KIRILLOV DOESN‚ÄÔT GO TO BED ALL NIGHT. WHAT COULD I COVER HER WITH, SHE IS SLEEPING SO SOUNDLY, BUT SHE MUST BE COLD, AH, SHE MUST BE COLD!‚ÄÙ AND ONCE MORE HE WENT TO LOOK AT HER; HER DRESS HAD WORKED UP A LITTLE AND HER RIGHT LEG WAS HALF UNCOVERED TO THE KNEE. HE SUDDENLY TURNED AWAY ALMOST IN DISMAY, TOOK OFF HIS WARM OVERCOAT, AND, REMAINING IN HIS WRETCHED OLD JACKET, COVERED IT UP, TRYING NOT TO LOOK AT IT.

A GREAT DEAL OF TIME WAS SPENT IN RIGHTING THE FIRE, STEPPING ABOUT ON TIPTOE, LOOKING AT THE SLEEPING WOMAN, DREAMING IN THE CORNER, THEN LOOKING AT HER AGAIN. TWO OR THREE HOURS HAD PASSED. DURING THAT TIME VERHOVENSKY AND LIPUTIN HAD BEEN AT KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS. AT LAST HE, TOO, BEGAN TO DOZE IN THE CORNER. HE HEARD HER GROAN; SHE WAKED UP AND CALLED HIM; HE JUMPED UP LIKE A CRIMINAL.

‚ÄÚMARIE, I WAS DROPPING ASLEEP.‚Ä¶ AH, WHAT A WRETCH I AM, MARIE!‚ÄÙ

SHE SAT UP, LOOKING ABOUT HER WITH WONDER, SEEMING NOT TO RECOGNISE WHERE SHE WAS, AND SUDDENLY LEAPT UP IN INDIGNATION AND ANGER.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE TAKEN YOUR BED, I FELL ASLEEP SO TIRED I DIDN‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING; HOW DARED YOU NOT WAKE ME? HOW COULD YOU DARE IMAGINE I MEANT TO BE A BURDEN TO YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW COULD I WAKE YOU, MARIE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU COULD, YOU OUGHT TO HAVE! YOU‚ÄÔVE NO OTHER BED HERE, AND I‚ÄÔVE TAKEN YOURS. YOU HAD NO BUSINESS TO PUT ME INTO A FALSE POSITION. OR DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT I‚ÄÔVE COME TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR CHARITY? KINDLY GET INTO YOUR BED AT ONCE AND I‚ÄÔLL LIE DOWN IN THE CORNER ON SOME CHAIRS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMARIE, THERE AREN‚ÄÔT CHAIRS ENOUGH, AND THERE‚ÄÔS NOTHING TO PUT ON THEM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEN SIMPLY OIL THE FLOOR. OR YOU‚ÄÔLL HAVE TO LIE ON THE FLOOR YOURSELF. I WANT TO LIE ON THE FLOOR AT ONCE, AT ONCE!‚ÄÙ

SHE STOOD UP, TRIED TO TAKE A STEP, BUT SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SPASM OF PAIN DEPRIVED HER OF ALL POWER AND ALL DETERMINATION, AND WITH A LOUD GROAN SHE FELL BACK ON THE BED. SHATOV RAN UP, BUT MARIE, HIDING HER FACE IN THE PILLOW, SEIZED HIS HAND AND GRIPPED AND SQUEEZED IT WITH ALL HER MIGHT. THIS LASTED A MINUTE.

‚ÄÚMARIE DARLING, THERE‚ÄÔS A DOCTOR FRENZEL LIVING HERE, A FRIEND OF MINE.‚Ä¶ I COULD RUN FOR HIM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNONSENSE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU MEAN BY NONSENSE? TELL ME, MARIE, WHAT IS IT HURTING YOU? FOR WE MIGHT TRY FOMENTATIONS ‚Ä¶ ON THE STOMACH FOR INSTANCE.‚Ä¶ I CAN DO THAT WITHOUT A DOCTOR.‚Ä¶ OR ELSE MUSTARD POULTICES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THIS,‚ÄÙ SHE ASKED STRANGELY, RAISING HER HEAD AND LOOKING AT HIM IN DISMAY.

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS WHAT, MARIE?‚ÄÙ SAID SHATOV, NOT UNDERSTANDING. ‚ÄÚWHAT ARE YOU ASKING ABOUT? GOOD HEAVENS! I AM QUITE BEWILDERED, EXCUSE MY NOT UNDERSTANDING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚACH, LET ME ALONE; IT‚ÄÔS NOT YOUR BUSINESS TO UNDERSTAND. AND IT WOULD BE TOO ABSURD ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ SHE SAID WITH A BITTER SMILE. ‚ÄÚTALK TO ME ABOUT SOMETHING. WALK ABOUT THE ROOM AND TALK. DON‚ÄÔT STAND OVER ME AND DON‚ÄÔT LOOK AT ME, I PARTICULARLY ASK YOU THAT FOR THE FIVE-HUNDREDTH TIME!‚ÄÙ

SHATOV BEGAN WALKING UP AND DOWN THE ROOM, LOOKING AT THE FLOOR, AND DOING HIS UTMOST NOT TO GLANCE AT HER.

‚ÄÚTHERE‚ÄÔS‚ÄÎDON‚ÄÔT BE ANGRY, MARIE, I ENTREAT YOU‚ÄÎTHERE‚ÄÔS SOME VEAL HERE, AND THERE‚ÄÔS TEA NOT FAR OFF.‚Ä¶ YOU HAD SO LITTLE BEFORE.‚ÄÙ

SHE MADE AN ANGRY GESTURE OF DISGUST. SHATOV BIT HIS TONGUE IN DESPAIR.

‚ÄÚLISTEN, I INTEND TO OPEN A BOOKBINDING BUSINESS HERE, ON RATIONAL CO-OPERATIVE PRINCIPLES. SINCE YOU LIVE HERE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT, WOULD IT BE SUCCESSFUL?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚECH, MARIE, PEOPLE DON‚ÄÔT READ BOOKS HERE, AND THERE ARE NONE HERE AT ALL. AND ARE THEY LIKELY TO BEGIN BINDING THEM!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHO ARE THEY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE LOCAL READERS AND INHABITANTS GENERALLY, MARIE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, THEN, SPEAK MORE CLEARLY. THEY INDEED, AND ONE DOESN‚ÄÔT KNOW WHO THEY ARE. YOU DON‚ÄÔT KNOW GRAMMAR!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS IN THE SPIRIT OF THE LANGUAGE,‚ÄÙ SHATOV MUTTERED.

‚ÄÚOH, GET ALONG WITH YOUR SPIRIT, YOU BORE ME. WHY SHOULDN‚ÄÔT THE LOCAL INHABITANT OR READER HAVE HIS BOOKS BOUND?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBECAUSE READING BOOKS AND HAVING THEM BOUND ARE TWO DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, AND THERE‚ÄÔS A VAST GULF BETWEEN THEM. TO BEGIN WITH, A MAN GRADUALLY GETS USED TO READING, IN THE COURSE OF AGES OF COURSE, BUT TAKES NO CARE OF HIS BOOKS AND THROWS THEM ABOUT, NOT THINKING THEM WORTH ATTENTION. BUT BINDING IMPLIES RESPECT FOR BOOKS, AND IMPLIES THAT NOT ONLY HE HAS GROWN FOND OF READING, BUT THAT HE LOOKS UPON IT AS SOMETHING OF VALUE. THAT PERIOD HAS NOT BEEN REACHED ANYWHERE IN RUSSIA YET. IN EUROPE BOOKS HAVE BEEN BOUND FOR A LONG WHILE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHOUGH THAT‚ÄÔS PEDANTIC, ANYWAY, IT‚ÄÔS NOT STUPID, AND REMINDS ME OF THE TIME THREE YEARS AGO; YOU USED TO BE RATHER CLEVER SOMETIMES THREE YEARS AGO.‚ÄÙ

SHE SAID THIS AS DISDAINFULLY AS HER OTHER CAPRICIOUS REMARKS.

‚ÄÚMARIE, MARIE,‚ÄÙ SAID SHATOV, TURNING TO HER, MUCH MOVED, ‚ÄÚOH, MARIE! IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW MUCH HAS HAPPENED IN THOSE THREE YEARS! I HEARD AFTERWARDS THAT YOU DESPISED ME FOR CHANGING MY CONVICTIONS. BUT WHAT ARE THE MEN I‚ÄÔVE BROKEN WITH? THE ENEMIES OF ALL TRUE LIFE, OUT-OF-DATE LIBERALS WHO ARE AFRAID OF THEIR OWN INDEPENDENCE, THE FLUNKEYS OF THOUGHT, THE ENEMIES OF INDIVIDUALITY AND FREEDOM, THE DECREPIT ADVOCATES OF DEADNESS AND ROTTENNESS! ALL THEY HAVE TO OFFER IS SENILITY, A GLORIOUS MEDIOCRITY OF THE MOST BOURGEOIS KIND, CONTEMPTIBLE SHALLOWNESS, A JEALOUS EQUALITY, EQUALITY WITHOUT INDIVIDUAL DIGNITY, EQUALITY AS IT‚ÄÔS UNDERSTOOD BY FLUNKEYS OR BY THE FRENCH IN ‚ÄÔ93. AND THE WORST OF IT IS THERE ARE SWARMS OF SCOUNDRELS AMONG THEM, SWARMS OF SCOUNDRELS!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, THERE ARE A LOT OF SCOUNDRELS,‚ÄÙ SHE BROUGHT OUT ABRUPTLY WITH PAINFUL EFFORT. SHE LAY STRETCHED OUT, MOTIONLESS, AS THOUGH AFRAID TO MOVE, WITH HER HEAD THROWN BACK ON THE PILLOW, RATHER ON ONE SIDE, STARING AT THE CEILING WITH EXHAUSTED BUT GLOWING EYES. HER FACE WAS PALE, HER LIPS WERE DRY AND HOT.

‚ÄÚYOU RECOGNISE IT, MARIE, YOU RECOGNISE IT,‚ÄÙ CRIED SHATOV. SHE TRIED TO SHAKE HER HEAD, AND SUDDENLY THE SAME SPASM CAME OVER HER AGAIN. AGAIN SHE HID HER FACE IN THE PILLOW, AND AGAIN FOR A FULL MINUTE SHE SQUEEZED SHATOV‚ÄÔS HAND TILL IT HURT. HE HAD RUN UP, BESIDE HIMSELF WITH ALARM.

‚ÄÚMARIE, MARIE! BUT IT MAY BE VERY SERIOUS, MARIE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBE QUIET ‚Ä¶ I WON‚ÄÔT HAVE IT, I WON‚ÄÔT HAVE IT,‚ÄÙ SHE SCREAMED ALMOST FURIOUSLY, TURNING HER FACE UPWARDS AGAIN. ‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT DARE TO LOOK AT ME WITH YOUR SYMPATHY! WALK ABOUT THE ROOM, SAY SOMETHING, TALK.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

SHATOV BEGAN MUTTERING SOMETHING AGAIN, LIKE ONE DISTRAUGHT.

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU DO HERE?‚ÄÙ SHE ASKED, INTERRUPTING HIM WITH CONTEMPTUOUS IMPATIENCE.

‚ÄÚI WORK IN A MERCHANT‚ÄÔS OFFICE. I COULD GET A FAIR AMOUNT OF MONEY EVEN HERE IF I CARED TO, MARIE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSO MUCH THE BETTER FOR YOU.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, DON‚ÄÔT SUPPOSE I MEANT ANYTHING, MARIE. I SAID IT WITHOUT THINKING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND WHAT DO YOU DO BESIDES? WHAT ARE YOU PREACHING? YOU CAN‚ÄÔT EXIST WITHOUT PREACHING, THAT‚ÄÔS YOUR CHARACTER!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM PREACHING GOD, MARIE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIN WHOM YOU DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE YOURSELF. I NEVER COULD SEE THE IDEA OF THAT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLET‚ÄÔS LEAVE THAT, MARIE; WE‚ÄÔLL TALK OF THAT LATER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT SORT OF PERSON WAS THIS MARYA TIMOFYEVNA HERE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWE‚ÄÔLL TALK OF THAT LATER TOO, MARIE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT DARE TO SAY SUCH THINGS TO ME! IS IT TRUE THAT HER DEATH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY ‚Ä¶ THE WICKEDNESS ‚Ä¶ OF THESE PEOPLE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOT A DOUBT OF IT,‚ÄÙ GROWLED SHATOV.

MARIE SUDDENLY RAISED HER HEAD AND CRIED OUT PAINFULLY:

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT DARE SPEAK OF THAT TO ME AGAIN, DON‚ÄÔT DARE TO, NEVER, NEVER!‚ÄÙ

AND SHE FELL BACK IN BED AGAIN, OVERCOME BY THE SAME CONVULSIVE AGONY; IT WAS THE THIRD TIME, BUT THIS TIME HER GROANS WERE LOUDER, IN FACT SHE SCREAMED.

‚ÄÚOH, YOU INSUFFERABLE MAN! OH, YOU UNBEARABLE MAN,‚ÄÙ SHE CRIED, TOSSING ABOUT RECKLESSLY, AND PUSHING AWAY SHATOV AS HE BENT OVER HER.

‚ÄÚMARIE, I‚ÄÔLL DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE.‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔLL WALK ABOUT AND TALK.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSURELY YOU MUST SEE THAT IT HAS BEGUN!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS BEGUN, MARIE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW CAN I TELL! DO I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT?‚Ä¶ I CURSE MYSELF! OH, CURSE IT ALL FROM THE BEGINNING!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMARIE, IF YOU‚ÄÔD TELL ME WHAT‚ÄÔS BEGINNING ‚Ä¶ OR ELSE I ‚Ä¶ IF YOU DON‚ÄÔT, WHAT AM I TO MAKE OF IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE A USELESS, THEORETICAL BABBLER. OH, CURSE EVERYTHING ON EARTH!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMARIE, MARIE!‚ÄÙ HE SERIOUSLY THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS BEGINNING TO GO MAD.

‚ÄÚSURELY YOU MUST SEE THAT I AM IN THE AGONIES OF CHILDBIRTH,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID, SITTING UP AND GAZING AT HIM WITH A TERRIBLE, HYSTERICAL VINDICTIVENESS THAT DISTORTED HER WHOLE FACE. ‚ÄÚI CURSE HIM BEFORE HE IS BORN, THIS CHILD!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMARIE,‚ÄÙ CRIED SHATOV, REALISING AT LAST WHAT IT MEANT. ‚ÄÚMARIE ‚Ä¶ BUT WHY DIDN‚ÄÔT YOU TELL ME BEFORE.‚ÄÙ HE PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER AT ONCE AND SEIZED HIS CAP WITH AN AIR OF VIGOROUS DETERMINATION.

‚ÄÚHOW COULD I TELL WHEN I CAME IN HERE? SHOULD I HAVE COME TO YOU IF I‚ÄÔD KNOWN? I WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE ANOTHER TEN DAYS! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?‚Ä¶ WHERE ARE YOU GOING? YOU MUSTN‚ÄÔT DARE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO FETCH A MIDWIFE! I‚ÄÔLL SELL THE REVOLVER. WE MUST GET MONEY BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE NOW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT DARE TO DO ANYTHING, DON‚ÄÔT DARE TO FETCH A MIDWIFE! BRING A PEASANT WOMAN, ANY OLD WOMAN, I‚ÄÔVE EIGHTY KOPECKS IN MY PURSE.‚Ä¶ PEASANT WOMEN HAVE BABIES WITHOUT MIDWIVES.‚Ä¶ AND IF I DIE, SO MUCH THE BETTER.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU SHALL HAVE A MIDWIFE AND AN OLD WOMAN TOO. BUT HOW AM I TO LEAVE YOU ALONE, MARIE!‚ÄÙ

BUT REFLECTING THAT IT WAS BETTER TO LEAVE HER ALONE NOW IN SPITE OF HER DESPERATE STATE THAN TO LEAVE HER WITHOUT HELP LATER, HE PAID NO ATTENTION TO HER GROANS, NOR HER ANGRY EXCLAMATIONS, BUT RUSHED DOWNSTAIRS, HURRYING ALL HE COULD.

III

FIRST OF ALL HE WENT TO KIRILLOV. IT WAS BY NOW ABOUT ONE O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE NIGHT. KIRILLOV WAS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM.

‚ÄÚKIRILLOV, MY WIFE IS IN CHILDBIRTH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW DO YOU MEAN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCHILDBIRTH, BEARING A CHILD!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ‚Ä¶ ARE NOT MISTAKEN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, NO, NO, SHE IS IN AGONIES! I WANT A WOMAN, ANY OLD WOMAN, I MUST HAVE ONE AT ONCE.‚Ä¶ CAN YOU GET ONE NOW? YOU USED TO HAVE A LOT OF OLD WOMEN.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚVERY SORRY THAT I AM NO GOOD AT CHILDBEARING,‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV ANSWERED THOUGHTFULLY; ‚ÄÚTHAT IS, NOT AT CHILDBEARING, BUT AT DOING ANYTHING FOR CHILDBEARING ‚Ä¶ OR ‚Ä¶ NO, I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HOW TO SAY IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU MEAN YOU CAN‚ÄÔT ASSIST AT A CONFINEMENT YOURSELF? BUT THAT‚ÄÔS NOT WHAT I‚ÄÔVE COME FOR. AN OLD WOMAN, I WANT A WOMAN, A NURSE, A SERVANT!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU SHALL HAVE AN OLD WOMAN, BUT NOT DIRECTLY, PERHAPS ‚Ä¶ IF YOU LIKE I‚ÄÔLL COME INSTEAD.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, IMPOSSIBLE; I AM RUNNING TO MADAME VIRGINSKY, THE MIDWIFE, NOW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚA HORRID WOMAN!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, YES, KIRILLOV, YES, BUT SHE IS THE BEST OF THEM ALL. YES, IT‚ÄÔLL ALL BE WITHOUT REVERENCE, WITHOUT GLADNESS, WITH CONTEMPT, WITH ABUSE, WITH BLASPHEMY IN THE PRESENCE OF SO GREAT A MYSTERY, THE COMING OF A NEW CREATURE! OH, SHE IS CURSING IT ALREADY!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF YOU LIKE I‚ÄÔLL ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, NO, BUT WHILE I‚ÄÔM RUNNING (OH, I‚ÄÔLL MAKE MADAME VIRGINSKY COME), WILL YOU GO TO THE FOOT OF MY STAIRCASE AND QUIETLY LISTEN? BUT DON‚ÄÔT VENTURE TO GO IN, YOU‚ÄÔLL FRIGHTEN HER; DON‚ÄÔT GO IN ON ANY ACCOUNT, YOU MUST ONLY LISTEN ‚Ä¶ IN CASE ANYTHING DREADFUL HAPPENS. IF ANYTHING VERY BAD HAPPENS, THEN RUN IN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI UNDERSTAND. I‚ÄÔVE ANOTHER ROUBLE. HERE IT IS. I MEANT TO HAVE A FOWL TO-MORROW, BUT NOW I DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO, MAKE HASTE, RUN WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT. THERE‚ÄÔS A SAMOVAR ALL THE NIGHT.‚ÄÙ

KIRILLOV KNEW NOTHING OF THE PRESENT DESIGN AGAINST SHATOV, NOR HAD HE HAD ANY IDEA IN THE PAST OF THE DEGREE OF DANGER THAT THREATENED HIM. HE ONLY KNEW THAT SHATOV HAD SOME OLD SCORES WITH ‚ÄÚTHOSE PEOPLE,‚ÄÙ AND ALTHOUGH HE WAS TO SOME EXTENT INVOLVED WITH THEM HIMSELF THROUGH INSTRUCTIONS HE HAD RECEIVED FROM ABROAD (NOT THAT THESE WERE OF MUCH CONSEQUENCE, HOWEVER, FOR HE HAD NEVER TAKEN ANY DIRECT SHARE IN ANYTHING), YET OF LATE HE HAD GIVEN IT ALL UP, HAVING LEFT OFF DOING ANYTHING ESPECIALLY FOR THE ‚ÄÚCAUSE,‚ÄÙ AND DEVOTED HIMSELF ENTIRELY TO A LIFE OF CONTEMPLATION. ALTHOUGH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD AT THE MEETING INVITED LIPUTIN TO GO WITH HIM TO KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LATTER WOULD TAKE UPON HIMSELF, AT A GIVEN MOMENT, THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ‚ÄÚSHATOV BUSINESS,‚ÄÙ YET IN HIS INTERVIEW WITH KIRILLOV HE HAD SAID NO WORD ABOUT SHATOV NOR ALLUDED TO HIM IN ANY WAY‚ÄÎPROBABLY CONSIDERING IT IMPOLITIC TO DO SO, AND THINKING THAT KIRILLOV COULD NOT BE RELIED UPON. HE PUT OFF SPEAKING ABOUT IT TILL NEXT DAY, WHEN IT WOULD BE ALL OVER AND WOULD THEREFORE NOT MATTER TO KIRILLOV; SUCH AT LEAST WAS PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS JUDGMENT OF HIM. LIPUTIN, TOO, WAS STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT SHATOV WAS NOT MENTIONED IN SPITE OF WHAT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD PROMISED, BUT HE WAS TOO MUCH AGITATED TO PROTEST.

SHATOV RAN LIKE A HURRICANE TO VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS HOUSE, CURSING THE DISTANCE AND FEELING IT ENDLESS.

HE HAD TO KNOCK A LONG TIME AT VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS; EVERY ONE HAD BEEN ASLEEP A LONG WHILE. BUT SHATOV DID NOT SCRUPLE TO BANG AT THE SHUTTERS WITH ALL HIS MIGHT. THE DOG CHAINED UP IN THE YARD DASHED ABOUT BARKING FURIOUSLY. THE DOGS CAUGHT IT UP ALL ALONG THE STREET, AND THERE WAS A REGULAR BABEL OF BARKING.

‚ÄÚWHY ARE YOU KNOCKING AND WHAT DO YOU WANT?‚ÄÙ SHATOV HEARD AT THE WINDOW AT LAST VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS GENTLE VOICE, BETRAYING NONE OF THE RESENTMENT APPROPRIATE TO THE ‚ÄÚOUTRAGE.‚ÄÙ THE SHUTTER WAS PUSHED BACK A LITTLE AND THE CASEMENT WAS OPENED.

‚ÄÚWHO‚ÄÔS THERE, WHAT SCOUNDREL IS IT?‚ÄÙ SHRILLED A FEMALE VOICE WHICH BETRAYED ALL THE RESENTMENT APPROPRIATE TO THE ‚ÄÚOUTRAGE.‚ÄÙ IT WAS THE OLD MAID, VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS RELATION.

‚ÄÚI AM SHATOV, MY WIFE HAS COME BACK TO ME AND SHE IS JUST CONFINED.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, LET HER BE, GET ALONG.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE COME FOR ARINA PROHOROVNA; I WON‚ÄÔT GO WITHOUT ARINA PROHOROVNA!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSHE CAN‚ÄÔT ATTEND TO EVERY ONE. PRACTICE AT NIGHT IS A SPECIAL LINE. TAKE YOURSELF OFF TO MAKSHEYEV‚ÄÔS AND DON‚ÄÔT DARE TO MAKE THAT DIN,‚ÄÙ RATTLED THE EXASPERATED FEMALE VOICE. HE COULD HEAR VIRGINSKY CHECKING HER; BUT THE OLD MAID PUSHED HIM AWAY AND WOULD NOT DESIST.

‚ÄÚI AM NOT GOING AWAY!‚ÄÙ SHATOV CRIED AGAIN.

‚ÄÚWAIT A LITTLE, WAIT A LITTLE,‚ÄÙ VIRGINSKY CRIED AT LAST, OVERPOWERING THE LADY. ‚ÄÚI BEG YOU TO WAIT FIVE MINUTES, SHATOV. I‚ÄÔLL WAKE ARINA PROHOROVNA. PLEASE DON‚ÄÔT KNOCK AND DON‚ÄÔT SHOUT.‚Ä¶ OH, HOW AWFUL IT ALL IS!‚ÄÙ

AFTER FIVE ENDLESS MINUTES, ARINA PROHOROVNA MADE HER APPEARANCE.

‚ÄÚHAS YOUR WIFE COME?‚ÄÙ SHATOV HEARD HER VOICE AT THE WINDOW, AND TO HIS SURPRISE IT WAS NOT AT ALL ILL-TEMPERED, ONLY AS USUAL PEREMPTORY, BUT ARINA PROHOROVNA COULD NOT SPEAK EXCEPT IN A PEREMPTORY TONE.

‚ÄÚYES, MY WIFE, AND SHE IS IN LABOUR.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMARYA IGNATYEVNA?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, MARYA IGNATYEVNA. OF COURSE IT‚ÄÔS MARYA IGNATYEVNA.‚ÄÙ

A SILENCE FOLLOWED. SHATOV WAITED. HE HEARD A WHISPERING IN THE HOUSE.

‚ÄÚHAS SHE BEEN HERE LONG?‚ÄÙ MADAME VIRGINSKY ASKED AGAIN.

‚ÄÚSHE CAME THIS EVENING AT EIGHT O‚ÄÔCLOCK. PLEASE MAKE HASTE.‚ÄÙ

AGAIN HE HEARD WHISPERING, AS THOUGH THEY WERE CONSULTING. ‚ÄÚLISTEN, YOU ARE NOT MAKING A MISTAKE? DID SHE SEND YOU FOR ME HERSELF?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, SHE DIDN‚ÄÔT SEND FOR YOU, SHE WANTS A PEASANT WOMAN, SO AS NOT TO BURDEN ME WITH EXPENSE, BUT DON‚ÄÔT BE AFRAID, I‚ÄÔLL PAY YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚVERY GOOD, I‚ÄÔLL COME, WHETHER YOU PAY OR NOT. I ALWAYS THOUGHT HIGHLY OF MARYA IGNATYEVNA FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF HER SENTIMENTS, THOUGH PERHAPS SHE WON‚ÄÔT REMEMBER ME. HAVE YOU GOT THE MOST NECESSARY THINGS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE NOTHING, BUT I‚ÄÔLL GET EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHERE IS SOMETHING GENEROUS EVEN IN THESE PEOPLE,‚ÄÙ SHATOV REFLECTED, AS HE SET OFF TO LYAMSHIN‚ÄÔS. ‚ÄÚTHE CONVICTIONS AND THE MAN ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS, VERY LIKELY I‚ÄÔVE BEEN VERY UNFAIR TO THEM!‚Ä¶ WE ARE ALL TO BLAME, WE ARE ALL TO BLAME ‚Ä¶ AND IF ONLY ALL WERE CONVINCED OF IT!‚ÄÙ

HE HAD NOT TO KNOCK LONG AT LYAMSHIN‚ÄÔS; THE LATTER, TO SHATOV‚ÄÔS SURPRISE, OPENED HIS CASEMENT AT ONCE, JUMPING OUT OF BED, BAREFOOT AND IN HIS NIGHT-CLOTHES AT THE RISK OF CATCHING COLD; AND HE WAS HYPOCHONDRIACAL AND ALWAYS ANXIOUS ABOUT HIS HEALTH. BUT THERE WAS A SPECIAL CAUSE FOR SUCH ALERTNESS AND HASTE: LYAMSHIN HAD BEEN IN A TREMOR ALL THE EVENING, AND HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP FOR EXCITEMENT AFTER THE MEETING OF THE QUINTET; HE WAS HAUNTED BY THE DREAD OF UNINVITED AND UNDESIRED VISITORS. THE NEWS OF SHATOV‚ÄÔS GIVING INFORMATION TORMENTED HIM MORE THAN ANYTHING.‚Ä¶ AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS THIS TERRIBLE LOUD KNOCKING AT THE WINDOW AS THOUGH TO JUSTIFY HIS FEARS.

HE WAS SO FRIGHTENED AT SEEING SHATOV THAT HE AT ONCE SLAMMED THE CASEMENT AND JUMPED BACK INTO BED. SHATOV BEGAN FURIOUSLY KNOCKING AND SHOUTING.

‚ÄÚHOW DARE YOU KNOCK LIKE THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?‚ÄÙ SHOUTED LYAMSHIN, IN A THREATENING VOICE, THOUGH HE WAS NUMB WITH FEAR, WHEN AT LEAST TWO MINUTES LATER HE VENTURED TO OPEN THE CASEMENT AGAIN, AND WAS AT LAST CONVINCED THAT SHATOV HAD COME ALONE.

‚ÄÚHERE‚ÄÔS YOUR REVOLVER FOR YOU; TAKE IT BACK, GIVE ME FIFTEEN ROUBLES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THE MATTER, ARE YOU DRUNK? THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS, I SHALL SIMPLY CATCH COLD. WAIT A MINUTE, I‚ÄÔLL JUST THROW MY RUG OVER ME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGIVE ME FIFTEEN ROUBLES AT ONCE. IF YOU DON‚ÄÔT GIVE IT ME, I‚ÄÔLL KNOCK AND SHOUT TILL DAYBREAK; I‚ÄÔLL BREAK YOUR WINDOW-FRAME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND I‚ÄÔLL SHOUT POLICE AND YOU‚ÄÔLL BE TAKEN TO THE LOCK-UP.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND AM I DUMB? CAN‚ÄÔT I SHOUT ‚ÄÒPOLICE‚ÄÔ TOO? WHICH OF US HAS MOST REASON TO BE AFRAID OF THE POLICE, YOU OR I?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND YOU CAN HOLD SUCH CONTEMPTIBLE OPINIONS! I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE HINTING AT.‚Ä¶ STOP, STOP, FOR GOD‚ÄÔS SAKE DON‚ÄÔT GO ON KNOCKING! UPON MY WORD, WHO HAS MONEY AT NIGHT? WHAT DO YOU WANT MONEY FOR, UNLESS YOU ARE DRUNK?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMY WIFE HAS COME BACK. I‚ÄÔVE TAKEN TEN ROUBLES OFF THE PRICE, I HAVEN‚ÄÔT FIRED IT ONCE; TAKE THE REVOLVER, TAKE IT THIS MINUTE!‚ÄÙ

LYAMSHIN MECHANICALLY PUT HIS HAND OUT OF THE CASEMENT AND TOOK THE REVOLVER; HE WAITED A LITTLE, AND SUDDENLY THRUSTING HIS HEAD OUT OF THE CASEMENT, AND WITH A SHIVER RUNNING DOWN HIS SPINE, FALTERED AS THOUGH HE WERE BESIDE HIMSELF.

‚ÄÚYOU ARE LYING, YOUR WIFE HASN‚ÄÔT COME BACK TO YOU.‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS ‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS SIMPLY THAT YOU WANT TO RUN AWAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE A FOOL. WHERE SHOULD I RUN TO? IT‚ÄÔS FOR YOUR PYOTR VERHOVENSKY TO RUN AWAY, NOT FOR ME. I‚ÄÔVE JUST BEEN TO THE MIDWIFE, MADAME VIRGINSKY, AND SHE CONSENTED AT ONCE TO COME TO ME. YOU CAN ASK THEM. MY WIFE IS IN AGONY; I NEED THE MONEY; GIVE IT ME!‚ÄÙ

A SWARM OF IDEAS FLARED UP IN LYAMSHIN‚ÄÔS CRAFTY MIND LIKE A SHOWER OF FIREWORKS. IT ALL SUDDENLY TOOK A DIFFERENT COLOUR, THOUGH STILL PANIC PREVENTED HIM FROM REFLECTING.

‚ÄÚBUT HOW ‚Ä¶ YOU ARE NOT LIVING WITH YOUR WIFE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL BREAK YOUR SKULL FOR QUESTIONS LIKE THAT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH DEAR, I UNDERSTAND, FORGIVE ME, I WAS STRUCK ALL OF A HEAP.‚Ä¶ BUT I UNDERSTAND, I UNDERSTAND ‚Ä¶ IS ARINA PROHOROVNA REALLY COMING? YOU SAID JUST NOW THAT SHE HAD GONE? YOU KNOW, THAT‚ÄÔS NOT TRUE. YOU SEE, YOU SEE, YOU SEE WHAT LIES YOU TELL AT EVERY STEP.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBY NOW, SHE MUST BE WITH MY WIFE ‚Ä¶ DON‚ÄÔT KEEP ME ‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS NOT MY FAULT YOU ARE A FOOL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS A LIE, I AM NOT A FOOL. EXCUSE ME, I REALLY CAN‚ÄÔT ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

AND UTTERLY DISTRAUGHT HE BEGAN SHUTTING THE CASEMENT AGAIN FOR THE THIRD TIME, BUT SHATOV GAVE SUCH A YELL THAT HE PUT HIS HEAD OUT AGAIN.

‚ÄÚBUT THIS IS SIMPLY AN UNPROVOKED ASSAULT! WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME, WHAT IS IT, WHAT IS IT, FORMULATE IT? AND THINK, ONLY THINK, IT‚ÄÔS THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WANT FIFTEEN ROUBLES, YOU SHEEP‚ÄÔS-HEAD!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT PERHAPS I DON‚ÄÔT CARE TO TAKE BACK THE REVOLVER. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE ME. YOU BOUGHT THE THING AND THE MATTER IS SETTLED, AND YOU‚ÄÔVE NO RIGHT.‚Ä¶ I CAN‚ÄÔT GIVE YOU A SUM LIKE THAT IN THE NIGHT, ANYHOW. WHERE AM I TO GET A SUM LIKE THAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ALWAYS HAVE MONEY. I‚ÄÔVE TAKEN TEN ROUBLES OFF THE PRICE, BUT EVERY ONE KNOWS YOU ARE A SKINFLINT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCOME THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW, DO YOU HEAR, THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW AT TWELVE O‚ÄÔCLOCK, AND I‚ÄÔLL GIVE YOU THE WHOLE OF IT, THAT WILL DO, WON‚ÄÔT IT?‚ÄÙ

SHATOV KNOCKED FURIOUSLY AT THE WINDOW-FRAME FOR THE THIRD TIME.

‚ÄÚGIVE ME TEN ROUBLES, AND TO-MORROW EARLY THE OTHER FIVE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW THE OTHER FIVE, TO-MORROW I SWEAR I SHAN‚ÄÔT HAVE IT. YOU‚ÄÔD BETTER NOT COME, YOU‚ÄÔD BETTER NOT COME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGIVE ME TEN, YOU SCOUNDREL!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY ARE YOU SO ABUSIVE. WAIT A MINUTE, I MUST LIGHT A CANDLE; YOU‚ÄÔVE BROKEN THE WINDOW.‚Ä¶ NOBODY SWEARS LIKE THAT AT NIGHT. HERE YOU ARE!‚ÄÙ HE HELD A NOTE TO HIM OUT OF THE WINDOW.

SHATOV SEIZED IT‚ÄÎIT WAS A NOTE FOR FIVE ROUBLES.

‚ÄÚON MY HONOUR I CAN‚ÄÔT DO MORE, IF YOU WERE TO MURDER ME, I COULDN‚ÄÔT; THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW I CAN GIVE YOU IT ALL, BUT NOW I CAN DO NOTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM NOT GOING AWAY!‚ÄÙ ROARED SHATOV.

‚ÄÚVERY WELL, TAKE IT, HERE‚ÄÔS SOME MORE, SEE, HERE‚ÄÔS SOME MORE, AND I WON‚ÄÔT GIVE MORE. YOU CAN SHOUT AT THE TOP OF YOUR VOICE, BUT I WON‚ÄÔT GIVE MORE, I WON‚ÄÔT, WHATEVER HAPPENS, I WON‚ÄÔT, I WON‚ÄÔT.‚ÄÙ

HE WAS IN A PERFECT FRENZY, DESPERATE AND PERSPIRING. THE TWO NOTES HE HAD JUST GIVEN HIM WERE EACH FOR A ROUBLE. SHATOV HAD SEVEN ROUBLES ALTOGETHER NOW.

‚ÄÚWELL, DAMN YOU, THEN, I‚ÄÔLL COME TO-MORROW. I‚ÄÔLL THRASH YOU, LYAMSHIN, IF YOU DON‚ÄÔT GIVE ME THE OTHER EIGHT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU WON‚ÄÔT FIND ME AT HOME, YOU FOOL!‚ÄÙ LYAMSHIN REFLECTED QUICKLY.

‚ÄÚSTAY, STAY!‚ÄÙ HE SHOUTED FRANTICALLY AFTER SHATOV, WHO WAS ALREADY RUNNING OFF. ‚ÄÚSTAY, COME BACK. TELL ME PLEASE, IS IT TRUE WHAT YOU SAID THAT YOUR WIFE HAS COME BACK?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFOOL!‚ÄÙ CRIED SHATOV, WITH A GESTURE OF DISGUST, AND RAN HOME AS HARD AS HE COULD.

IV

I MAY MENTION THAT ANNA PROHOROVNA KNEW NOTHING OF THE RESOLUTIONS THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN AT THE MEETING THE DAY BEFORE. ON RETURNING HOME OVERWHELMED AND EXHAUSTED, VIRGINSKY HAD NOT VENTURED TO TELL HER OF THE DECISION THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN, YET HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM TELLING HER HALF‚ÄÎTHAT IS, ALL THAT VERHOVENSKY HAD TOLD THEM OF THE CERTAINTY OF SHATOV‚ÄÔS INTENTION TO BETRAY THEM; BUT HE ADDED AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE DID NOT QUITE BELIEVE IT. ARINA PROHOROVNA WAS TERRIBLY ALARMED. THIS WAS WHY SHE DECIDED AT ONCE TO GO WHEN SHATOV CAME TO FETCH HER, THOUGH SHE WAS TIRED OUT, AS SHE HAD BEEN HARD AT WORK AT A CONFINEMENT ALL THE NIGHT BEFORE. SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN CONVINCED THAT ‚ÄÚA WRETCHED CREATURE LIKE SHATOV WAS CAPABLE OF ANY POLITICAL BASENESS,‚ÄÙ BUT THE ARRIVAL OF MARYA IGNATYEVNA PUT THINGS IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT. SHATOV‚ÄÔS ALARM, THE DESPAIRING TONE OF HIS ENTREATIES, THE WAY HE BEGGED FOR HELP, CLEARLY SHOWED A COMPLETE CHANGE OF FEELING IN THE TRAITOR: A MAN WHO WAS READY TO BETRAY HIMSELF MERELY FOR THE SAKE OF RUINING OTHERS WOULD, SHE THOUGHT, HAVE HAD A DIFFERENT AIR AND TONE. IN SHORT, ARINA PROHOROVNA RESOLVED TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER FOR HERSELF, WITH HER OWN EYES. VIRGINSKY WAS VERY GLAD OF HER DECISION, HE FELT AS THOUGH A HUNDREDWEIGHT HAD BEEN LIFTED OFF HIM! HE EVEN BEGAN TO FEEL HOPEFUL: SHATOV‚ÄÔS APPEARANCE SEEMED TO HIM UTTERLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH VERHOVENSKY‚ÄÔS SUPPOSITION.

SHATOV WAS NOT MISTAKEN: ON GETTING HOME HE FOUND ARINA PROHOROVNA ALREADY WITH MARIE. SHE HAD JUST ARRIVED, HAD CONTEMPTUOUSLY DISMISSED KIRILLOV, WHOM SHE FOUND HANGING ABOUT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS, HAD HASTILY INTRODUCED HERSELF TO MARIE, WHO HAD NOT RECOGNISED HER AS HER FORMER ACQUAINTANCE, FOUND HER IN ‚ÄÚA VERY BAD WAY,‚ÄÙ THAT IS ILL-TEMPERED, IRRITABLE AND IN ‚ÄÚA STATE OF COWARDLY DESPAIR,‚ÄÙ AND WITHIN FIVE MINUTES HAD COMPLETELY SILENCED ALL HER PROTESTS.

‚ÄÚWHY DO YOU KEEP ON THAT YOU DON‚ÄÔT WANT AN EXPENSIVE MIDWIFE?‚ÄÙ SHE WAS SAYING AT THE MOMENT WHEN SHATOV CAME IN. ‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS PERFECT NONSENSE, IT‚ÄÔS A FALSE IDEA ARISING FROM THE ABNORMALITY OF YOUR CONDITION. IN THE HANDS OF SOME ORDINARY OLD WOMAN, SOME PEASANT MIDWIFE, YOU‚ÄÔD HAVE FIFTY CHANCES OF GOING WRONG AND THEN YOU‚ÄÔD HAVE MORE BOTHER AND EXPENSE THAN WITH A REGULAR MIDWIFE. HOW DO YOU KNOW I AM AN EXPENSIVE MIDWIFE? YOU CAN PAY AFTERWARDS; I WON‚ÄÔT CHARGE YOU MUCH AND I ANSWER FOR MY SUCCESS; YOU WON‚ÄÔT DIE IN MY HANDS, I‚ÄÔVE SEEN WORSE CASES THAN YOURS. AND I CAN SEND THE BABY TO A FOUNDLING ASYLUM TO-MORROW, IF YOU LIKE, AND THEN TO BE BROUGHT UP IN THE COUNTRY, AND THAT‚ÄÔS ALL IT WILL MEAN. AND MEANTIME YOU‚ÄÔLL GROW STRONG AGAIN, TAKE UP SOME RATIONAL WORK, AND IN A VERY SHORT TIME YOU‚ÄÔLL REPAY SHATOV FOR SHELTERING YOU AND FOR THE EXPENSE, WHICH WILL NOT BE SO GREAT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS NOT THAT ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔVE NO RIGHT TO BE A BURDEN.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚRATIONAL FEELINGS AND WORTHY OF A CITIZEN, BUT YOU CAN TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, SHATOV WILL SPEND SCARCELY ANYTHING, IF HE IS WILLING TO BECOME EVER SO LITTLE A MAN OF SOUND IDEAS INSTEAD OF THE FANTASTIC PERSON HE IS. HE HAS ONLY NOT TO DO ANYTHING STUPID, NOT TO RAISE AN ALARM, NOT TO RUN ABOUT THE TOWN WITH HIS TONGUE OUT. IF WE DON‚ÄÔT RESTRAIN HIM HE WILL BE KNOCKING UP ALL THE DOCTORS OF THE TOWN BEFORE THE MORNING; HE WAKED ALL THE DOGS IN MY STREET. THERE‚ÄÔS NO NEED OF DOCTORS I‚ÄÔVE SAID ALREADY. I‚ÄÔLL ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING. YOU CAN HIRE AN OLD WOMAN IF YOU LIKE TO WAIT ON YOU, THAT WON‚ÄÔT COST MUCH. THOUGH HE TOO CAN DO SOMETHING BESIDES THE SILLY THINGS HE‚ÄÔS BEEN DOING. HE‚ÄÔS GOT HANDS AND FEET, HE CAN RUN TO THE CHEMIST‚ÄÔS WITHOUT OFFENDING YOUR FEELINGS BY BEING TOO BENEVOLENT. AS THOUGH IT WERE A CASE OF BENEVOLENCE! HASN‚ÄÔT HE BROUGHT YOU INTO THIS POSITION? DIDN‚ÄÔT HE MAKE YOU BREAK WITH THE FAMILY IN WHICH YOU WERE A GOVERNESS, WITH THE EGOISTIC OBJECT OF MARRYING YOU? WE HEARD OF IT, YOU KNOW ‚Ä¶ THOUGH HE DID RUN FOR ME LIKE ONE POSSESSED AND YELL SO ALL THE STREET COULD HEAR. I WON‚ÄÔT FORCE MYSELF UPON ANYONE AND HAVE COME ONLY FOR YOUR SAKE, ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT ALL OF US ARE BOUND TO HOLD TOGETHER! AND I TOLD HIM SO BEFORE I LEFT THE HOUSE. IF YOU THINK I AM IN THE WAY, GOOD-BYE, I ONLY HOPE YOU WON‚ÄÔT HAVE TROUBLE WHICH MIGHT SO EASILY BE AVERTED.‚ÄÙ

AND SHE POSITIVELY GOT UP FROM THE CHAIR. MARIE WAS SO HELPLESS, IN SUCH PAIN, AND‚ÄÎTHE TRUTH MUST BE CONFESSED‚ÄÎSO FRIGHTENED OF WHAT WAS BEFORE HER THAT SHE DARED NOT LET HER GO. BUT THIS WOMAN WAS SUDDENLY HATEFUL TO HER, WHAT SHE SAID WAS NOT WHAT SHE WANTED, THERE WAS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT IN MARIE‚ÄÔS SOUL. YET THE PREDICTION THAT SHE MIGHT POSSIBLY DIE IN THE HANDS OF AN INEXPERIENCED PEASANT WOMAN OVERCAME HER AVERSION. BUT SHE MADE UP FOR IT BY BEING MORE EXACTING AND MORE RUTHLESS THAN EVER WITH SHATOV. SHE ENDED BY FORBIDDING HIM NOT ONLY TO LOOK AT HER BUT EVEN TO STAND FACING HER. HER PAINS BECAME MORE VIOLENT. HER CURSES, HER ABUSE BECAME MORE AND MORE FRANTIC.

‚ÄÚECH, WE‚ÄÔLL SEND HIM AWAY,‚ÄÙ ARINA PROHOROVNA RAPPED OUT. ‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE, HE IS SIMPLY FRIGHTENING YOU; HE IS AS WHITE AS A CORPSE! WHAT IS IT TO YOU, TELL ME PLEASE, YOU ABSURD FELLOW? WHAT A FARCE!‚ÄÙ

SHATOV MADE NO REPLY, HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO SAY NOTHING. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE SEEN MANY A FOOLISH FATHER, HALF CRAZY IN SUCH CASES. BUT THEY, AT ANY RATE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBE QUIET OR LEAVE ME TO DIE! DON‚ÄÔT SAY ANOTHER WORD! I WON‚ÄÔT HAVE IT, I WON‚ÄÔT HAVE IT!‚ÄÙ SCREAMED MARIE.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO SAY ANOTHER WORD, IF YOU ARE NOT OUT OF YOUR MIND, AS I THINK YOU ARE IN YOUR CONDITION. WE MUST TALK OF WHAT WE WANT, ANYWAY: TELL ME, HAVE YOU ANYTHING READY? YOU ANSWER, SHATOV, SHE IS INCAPABLE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTELL ME WHAT‚ÄÔS NEEDED?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT MEANS YOU‚ÄÔVE NOTHING READY.‚ÄÙ SHE RECKONED UP ALL THAT WAS QUITE NECESSARY, AND ONE MUST DO HER THE JUSTICE TO SAY SHE ONLY ASKED FOR WHAT WAS ABSOLUTELY INDISPENSABLE, THE BAREST NECESSARIES. SOME THINGS SHATOV HAD. MARIE TOOK OUT HER KEY AND HELD IT OUT TO HIM, FOR HIM TO LOOK IN HER BAG. AS HIS HANDS SHOOK HE WAS LONGER THAN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OPENING THE UNFAMILIAR LOCK. MARIE FLEW INTO A RAGE, BUT WHEN ARINA PROHOROVNA RUSHED UP TO TAKE THE KEY FROM HIM, SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW HER ON ANY ACCOUNT TO LOOK INTO HER BAG AND WITH PEEVISH CRIES AND TEARS INSISTED THAT NO ONE SHOULD OPEN THE BAG BUT SHATOV.

SOME THINGS HE HAD TO FETCH FROM KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS. NO SOONER HAD SHATOV TURNED TO GO FOR THEM THAN SHE BEGAN FRANTICALLY CALLING HIM BACK AND WAS ONLY QUIETED WHEN SHATOV HAD RUSHED IMPETUOUSLY BACK FROM THE STAIRS, AND EXPLAINED THAT HE SHOULD ONLY BE GONE A MINUTE TO FETCH SOMETHING INDISPENSABLE AND WOULD BE BACK AT ONCE.

‚ÄÚWELL, MY LADY, IT‚ÄÔS HARD TO PLEASE YOU,‚ÄÙ LAUGHED ARINA PROHOROVNA, ‚ÄÚONE MINUTE HE MUST STAND WITH HIS FACE TO THE WALL AND NOT DARE TO LOOK AT YOU, AND THE NEXT HE MUSTN‚ÄÔT BE GONE FOR A MINUTE, OR YOU BEGIN CRYING. HE MAY BEGIN TO IMAGINE SOMETHING. COME, COME, DON‚ÄÔT BE SILLY, DON‚ÄÔT BLUBBER, I WAS LAUGHING, YOU KNOW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE WON‚ÄÔT DARE TO IMAGINE ANYTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTUT, TUT, TUT, IF HE DIDN‚ÄÔT LOVE YOU LIKE A SHEEP HE WOULDN‚ÄÔT RUN ABOUT THE STREETS WITH HIS TONGUE OUT AND WOULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE ROUSED ALL THE DOGS IN THE TOWN. HE BROKE MY WINDOW-FRAME.‚ÄÙ

V

HE FOUND KIRILLOV STILL PACING UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM SO PREOCCUPIED THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE ARRIVAL OF SHATOV‚ÄÔS WIFE, AND HEARD WHAT HE SAID WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING HIM.

‚ÄÚOH, YES!‚ÄÙ HE RECOLLECTED SUDDENLY, AS THOUGH TEARING HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT AND ONLY FOR AN INSTANT FROM SOME ABSORBING IDEA, ‚ÄÚYES ‚Ä¶ AN OLD WOMAN.‚Ä¶ A WIFE OR AN OLD WOMAN? STAY A MINUTE: A WIFE AND AN OLD WOMAN, IS THAT IT? I REMEMBER. I‚ÄÔVE BEEN, THE OLD WOMAN WILL COME, ONLY NOT JUST NOW. TAKE THE PILLOW. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE? YES.‚Ä¶ STAY, DO YOU HAVE MOMENTS OF THE ETERNAL HARMONY, SHATOV?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU KNOW, KIRILLOV, YOU MUSTN‚ÄÔT GO ON STAYING UP EVERY NIGHT.‚ÄÙ

KIRILLOV CAME OUT OF HIS REVERIE AND, STRANGE TO SAY, SPOKE FAR MORE COHERENTLY THAN HE USUALLY DID; IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE HAD FORMULATED IT LONG AGO AND PERHAPS WRITTEN IT DOWN.

‚ÄÚTHERE ARE SECONDS‚ÄÎTHEY COME FIVE OR SIX AT A TIME‚ÄÎWHEN YOU SUDDENLY FEEL THE PRESENCE OF THE ETERNAL HARMONY PERFECTLY ATTAINED. IT‚ÄÔS SOMETHING NOT EARTHLY‚ÄÎI DON‚ÄÔT MEAN IN THE SENSE THAT IT‚ÄÔS HEAVENLY‚ÄÎBUT IN THAT SENSE THAT MAN CANNOT ENDURE IT IN HIS EARTHLY ASPECT. HE MUST BE PHYSICALLY CHANGED OR DIE. THIS FEELING IS CLEAR AND UNMISTAKABLE; IT‚ÄÔS AS THOUGH YOU APPREHEND ALL NATURE AND SUDDENLY SAY, ‚ÄÒYES, THAT‚ÄÔS RIGHT.‚ÄÔ GOD, WHEN HE CREATED THE WORLD, SAID AT THE END OF EACH DAY OF CREATION, ‚ÄÒYES, IT‚ÄÔS RIGHT, IT‚ÄÔS GOOD.‚ÄÔ IT ‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS NOT BEING DEEPLY MOVED, BUT SIMPLY JOY. YOU DON‚ÄÔT FORGIVE ANYTHING BECAUSE THERE IS NO MORE NEED OF FORGIVENESS. IT‚ÄÔS NOT THAT YOU LOVE‚ÄÎOH, THERE‚ÄÔS SOMETHING IN IT HIGHER THAN LOVE‚ÄÎWHAT‚ÄÔS MOST AWFUL IS THAT IT‚ÄÔS TERRIBLY CLEAR AND SUCH JOY. IF IT LASTED MORE THAN FIVE SECONDS, THE SOUL COULD NOT ENDURE IT AND MUST PERISH. IN THOSE FIVE SECONDS I LIVE THROUGH A LIFETIME, AND I‚ÄÔD GIVE MY WHOLE LIFE FOR THEM, BECAUSE THEY ARE WORTH IT. TO ENDURE TEN SECONDS ONE MUST BE PHYSICALLY CHANGED. I THINK MAN OUGHT TO GIVE UP HAVING CHILDREN‚ÄÎWHAT‚ÄÔS THE USE OF CHILDREN, WHAT‚ÄÔS THE USE OF EVOLUTION WHEN THE GOAL HAS BEEN ATTAINED? IN THE GOSPEL IT IS WRITTEN THAT THERE WILL BE NO CHILD-BEARING IN THE RESURRECTION, BUT THAT MEN WILL BE LIKE THE ANGELS OF THE LORD. THAT‚ÄÔS A HINT. IS YOUR WIFE BEARING A CHILD?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚKIRILLOV, DOES THIS OFTEN HAPPEN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚONCE IN THREE DAYS, OR ONCE A WEEK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT YOU HAVE FITS, PERHAPS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, YOU WILL. BE CAREFUL, KIRILLOV. I‚ÄÔVE HEARD THAT‚ÄÔS JUST HOW FITS BEGIN. AN EPILEPTIC DESCRIBED EXACTLY THAT SENSATION BEFORE A FIT, WORD FOR WORD AS YOU‚ÄÔVE DONE. HE MENTIONED FIVE SECONDS, TOO, AND SAID THAT MORE COULD NOT BE ENDURED. REMEMBER MAHOMET‚ÄÔS PITCHER FROM WHICH NO DROP OF WATER WAS SPILT WHILE HE CIRCLED PARADISE ON HIS HORSE. THAT WAS A CASE OF FIVE SECONDS TOO; THAT‚ÄÔS TOO MUCH LIKE YOUR ETERNAL HARMONY, AND MAHOMET WAS AN EPILEPTIC. BE CAREFUL, KIRILLOV, IT‚ÄÔS EPILEPSY!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT WON‚ÄÔT HAVE TIME,‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV SMILED GENTLY.

VI

THE NIGHT WAS PASSING. SHATOV WAS SENT HITHER AND THITHER, ABUSED, CALLED BACK. MARIE WAS REDUCED TO THE MOST ABJECT TERROR FOR LIFE. SHE SCREAMED THAT SHE WANTED TO LIVE, THAT ‚ÄÚSHE MUST, SHE MUST,‚ÄÙ AND WAS AFRAID TO DIE. ‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO, I DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO!‚ÄÙ SHE REPEATED. IF ARINA PROHOROVNA HAD NOT BEEN THERE, THINGS WOULD HAVE GONE VERY BADLY. BY DEGREES SHE GAINED COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE PATIENT‚ÄÎWHO BEGAN TO OBEY EVERY WORD, EVERY ORDER FROM HER LIKE A CHILD. ARINA PROHOROVNA RULED BY STERNNESS NOT BY KINDNESS, BUT SHE WAS FIRST-RATE AT HER WORK. IT BEGAN TO GET LIGHT ‚Ä¶ ARINA PROHOROVNA SUDDENLY IMAGINED THAT SHATOV HAD JUST RUN OUT ON TO THE STAIRS TO SAY HIS PRAYERS AND BEGAN LAUGHING. MARIE LAUGHED TOO, SPITEFULLY, MALIGNANTLY, AS THOUGH SUCH LAUGHTER RELIEVED HER. AT LAST THEY DROVE SHATOV AWAY ALTOGETHER. A DAMP, COLD MORNING DAWNED. HE PRESSED HIS FACE TO THE WALL IN THE CORNER JUST AS HE HAD DONE THE EVENING BEFORE WHEN ERKEL CAME. HE WAS TREMBLING LIKE A LEAF, AFRAID TO THINK, BUT HIS MIND CAUGHT AT EVERY THOUGHT AS IT DOES IN DREAMS.

HE WAS CONTINUALLY BEING CARRIED AWAY BY DAY-DREAMS, WHICH SNAPPED OFF SHORT LIKE A ROTTEN THREAD. FROM THE ROOM CAME NO LONGER GROANS BUT AWFUL ANIMAL CRIES, UNENDURABLE, INCREDIBLE. HE TRIED TO STOP UP HIS EARS, BUT COULD NOT, AND HE FELL ON HIS KNEES, REPEATING UNCONSCIOUSLY, ‚ÄÚMARIE, MARIE!‚ÄÙ THEN SUDDENLY HE HEARD A CRY, A NEW CRY, WHICH MADE SHATOV START AND JUMP UP FROM HIS KNEES, THE CRY OF A BABY, A WEAK DISCORDANT CRY. HE CROSSED HIMSELF AND RUSHED INTO THE ROOM. ARINA PROHOROVNA HELD IN HER HANDS A LITTLE RED WRINKLED CREATURE, SCREAMING, AND MOVING ITS LITTLE ARMS AND LEGS, FEARFULLY HELPLESS, AND LOOKING AS THOUGH IT COULD BE BLOWN AWAY BY A PUFF OF WIND, BUT SCREAMING AND SEEMING TO ASSERT ITS FULL RIGHT TO LIVE. MARIE WAS LYING AS THOUGH INSENSIBLE, BUT A MINUTE LATER SHE OPENED HER EYES, AND BENT A STRANGE, STRANGE LOOK ON SHATOV: IT WAS SOMETHING QUITE NEW, THAT LOOK. WHAT IT MEANT EXACTLY HE WAS NOT ABLE TO UNDERSTAND YET, BUT HE HAD NEVER KNOWN SUCH A LOOK ON HER FACE BEFORE.

‚ÄÚIS IT A BOY? IS IT A BOY?‚ÄÙ SHE ASKED ARINA PROHOROVNA IN AN EXHAUSTED VOICE.

‚ÄÚIT IS A BOY,‚ÄÙ THE LATTER SHOUTED IN REPLY, AS SHE BOUND UP THE CHILD.

WHEN SHE HAD BOUND HIM UP AND WAS ABOUT TO LAY HIM ACROSS THE BED BETWEEN THE TWO PILLOWS, SHE GAVE HIM TO SHATOV FOR A MINUTE TO HOLD. MARIE SIGNED TO HIM ON THE SLY AS THOUGH AFRAID OF ARINA PROHOROVNA. HE UNDERSTOOD AT ONCE AND BROUGHT THE BABY TO SHOW HER.

‚ÄÚHOW ‚Ä¶ PRETTY HE IS,‚ÄÙ SHE WHISPERED WEAKLY WITH A SMILE.

‚ÄÚFOO, WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE,‚ÄÙ ARINA PROHOROVNA LAUGHED GAILY IN TRIUMPH, GLANCING AT SHATOV‚ÄÔS FACE. ‚ÄÚWHAT A FUNNY FACE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU MAY BE MERRY, ARINA PROHOROVNA.‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS A GREAT JOY,‚ÄÙ SHATOV FALTERED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF IDIOTIC BLISS, RADIANT AT THE PHRASE MARIE HAD UTTERED ABOUT THE CHILD.

‚ÄÚWHERE DOES THE GREAT JOY COME IN?‚ÄÙ SAID ARINA PROHOROVNA GOOD-HUMOUREDLY, BUSTLING ABOUT, CLEARING UP, AND WORKING LIKE A CONVICT.

‚ÄÚTHE MYSTERIOUS COMING OF A NEW CREATURE, A GREAT AND INEXPLICABLE MYSTERY; AND WHAT A PITY IT IS, ARINA PROHOROVNA, THAT YOU DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND IT.‚ÄÙ

SHATOV SPOKE IN AN INCOHERENT, STUPEFIED AND ECSTATIC WAY. SOMETHING SEEMED TO BE TOTTERING IN HIS HEAD AND WELLING UP FROM HIS SOUL APART FROM HIS OWN WILL.

‚ÄÚTHERE WERE TWO AND NOW THERE‚ÄÔS A THIRD HUMAN BEING, A NEW SPIRIT, FINISHED AND COMPLETE, UNLIKE THE HANDIWORK OF MAN; A NEW THOUGHT AND A NEW LOVE ‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS POSITIVELY FRIGHTENING.‚Ä¶ AND THERE‚ÄÔS NOTHING GRANDER IN THE WORLD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚECH, WHAT NONSENSE HE TALKS! IT‚ÄÔS SIMPLY A FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORGANISM, AND THERE‚ÄÔS NOTHING ELSE IN IT, NO MYSTERY,‚ÄÙ SAID ARINA PROHOROVNA WITH GENUINE AND GOOD-HUMOURED LAUGHTER. ‚ÄÚIF YOU TALK LIKE THAT, EVERY FLY IS A MYSTERY. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT: SUPERFLUOUS PEOPLE OUGHT NOT TO BE BORN. WE MUST FIRST REMOULD EVERYTHING SO THAT THEY WON‚ÄÔT BE SUPERFLUOUS AND THEN BRING THEM INTO THE WORLD. AS IT IS, WE SHALL HAVE TO TAKE HIM TO THE FOUNDLING, THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW.‚Ä¶ THOUGH THAT‚ÄÔS AS IT SHOULD BE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WILL NEVER LET HIM GO TO THE FOUNDLING,‚ÄÙ SHATOV PRONOUNCED RESOLUTELY, STARING AT THE FLOOR.

‚ÄÚYOU ADOPT HIM AS YOUR SON?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE IS MY SON.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOF COURSE HE IS A SHATOV, LEGALLY HE IS A SHATOV, AND THERE‚ÄÔS NO NEED FOR YOU TO POSE AS A HUMANITARIAN. MEN CAN‚ÄÔT GET ON WITHOUT FINE WORDS. THERE, THERE, IT‚ÄÔS ALL RIGHT, BUT LOOK HERE, MY FRIENDS,‚ÄÙ SHE ADDED, HAVING FINISHED CLEARING UP AT LAST, ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS TIME FOR ME TO GO. I‚ÄÔLL COME AGAIN THIS MORNING, AND AGAIN IN THE EVENING IF NECESSARY, BUT NOW, SINCE EVERYTHING HAS GONE OFF SO WELL, I MUST RUN OFF TO MY OTHER PATIENTS, THEY‚ÄÔVE BEEN EXPECTING ME LONG AGO. I BELIEVE YOU GOT AN OLD WOMAN SOMEWHERE, SHATOV; AN OLD WOMAN IS ALL VERY WELL, BUT DON‚ÄÔT YOU, HER TENDER HUSBAND, DESERT HER; SIT BESIDE HER, YOU MAY BE OF USE; MARYA IGNATYEVNA WON‚ÄÔT DRIVE YOU AWAY, I FANCY.‚Ä¶ THERE, THERE, I WAS ONLY LAUGHING.‚ÄÙ

AT THE GATE, TO WHICH SHATOV ACCOMPANIED HER, SHE ADDED TO HIM ALONE.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE GIVEN ME SOMETHING TO LAUGH AT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE; I SHAN‚ÄÔT CHARGE YOU ANYTHING; I SHALL LAUGH AT YOU IN MY SLEEP! I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING FUNNIER THAN YOU LAST NIGHT.‚ÄÙ

SHE WENT OFF VERY WELL SATISFIED. SHATOV‚ÄÔS APPEARANCE AND CONVERSATION MADE IT AS CLEAR AS DAYLIGHT THAT THIS MAN ‚ÄÚWAS GOING IN FOR BEING A FATHER AND WAS A NINNY.‚ÄÙ SHE RAN HOME ON PURPOSE TO TELL VIRGINSKY ABOUT IT, THOUGH IT WAS SHORTER AND MORE DIRECT TO GO TO ANOTHER PATIENT.

‚ÄÚMARIE, SHE TOLD YOU NOT TO GO TO SLEEP FOR A LITTLE TIME, THOUGH, I SEE, IT‚ÄÔS VERY HARD FOR YOU,‚ÄÙ SHATOV BEGAN TIMIDLY. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL SIT HERE BY THE WINDOW AND TAKE CARE OF YOU, SHALL I?‚ÄÙ

AND HE SAT DOWN, BY THE WINDOW BEHIND THE SOFA SO THAT SHE COULD NOT SEE HIM. BUT BEFORE A MINUTE HAD PASSED SHE CALLED HIM AND FRETFULLY ASKED HIM TO ARRANGE THE PILLOW. HE BEGAN ARRANGING IT. SHE LOOKED ANGRILY AT THE WALL.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS NOT RIGHT, THAT‚ÄÔS NOT RIGHT.‚Ä¶ WHAT HANDS!‚ÄÙ

SHATOV DID IT AGAIN.

‚ÄÚSTOOP DOWN TO ME,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID WILDLY, TRYING HARD NOT TO LOOK AT HIM.

HE STARTED BUT STOOPED DOWN.

‚ÄÚMORE ‚Ä¶ NOT SO ‚Ä¶ NEARER,‚ÄÙ AND SUDDENLY HER LEFT ARM WAS IMPULSIVELY THROWN ROUND HIS NECK AND HE FELT HER WARM MOIST KISS ON HIS FOREHEAD.

‚ÄÚMARIE!‚ÄÙ

HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING, SHE WAS STRUGGLING WITH HERSELF, BUT SUDDENLY SHE RAISED HERSELF AND SAID WITH FLASHING EYES:

‚ÄÚNIKOLAY STAVROGIN IS A SCOUNDREL!‚ÄÙ AND SHE FELL BACK HELPLESSLY WITH HER FACE IN THE PILLOW, SOBBING HYSTERICALLY, AND TIGHTLY SQUEEZING SHATOV‚ÄÔS HAND IN HERS.

FROM THAT MOMENT SHE WOULD NOT LET HIM LEAVE HER; SHE INSISTED ON HIS SITTING BY HER PILLOW. SHE COULD NOT TALK MUCH BUT SHE KEPT GAZING AT HIM AND SMILING BLISSFULLY. SHE SEEMED SUDDENLY TO HAVE BECOME A SILLY GIRL. EVERYTHING SEEMED TRANSFORMED. SHATOV CRIED LIKE A BOY, THEN TALKED OF GOD KNOWS WHAT, WILDLY, CRAZILY, WITH INSPIRATION, KISSED HER HANDS; SHE LISTENED ENTRANCED, PERHAPS NOT UNDERSTANDING HIM, BUT CARESSINGLY RUFFLING HIS HAIR WITH HER WEAK HAND, SMOOTHING IT AND ADMIRING IT. HE TALKED ABOUT KIRILLOV, OF HOW THEY WOULD NOW BEGIN ‚ÄÚA NEW LIFE‚ÄÙ FOR GOOD, OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD, OF THE GOODNESS OF ALL MEN.‚Ä¶ SHE TOOK OUT THE CHILD AGAIN TO GAZE AT IT RAPTUROUSLY.

‚ÄÚMARIE,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, AS HE HELD THE CHILD IN HIS ARMS, ‚ÄÚALL THE OLD MADNESS, SHAME, AND DEADNESS IS OVER, ISN‚ÄÔT IT? LET US WORK HARD AND BEGIN A NEW LIFE, THE THREE OF US, YES, YES!‚Ä¶ OH, BY THE WAY, WHAT SHALL WE CALL HIM, MARIE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT SHALL WE CALL HIM?‚ÄÙ SHE REPEATED WITH SURPRISE, AND THERE WAS A SUDDEN LOOK OF TERRIBLE GRIEF IN HER FACE.

SHE CLASPED HER HANDS, LOOKED REPROACHFULLY AT SHATOV AND HID HER FACE IN THE PILLOW.

‚ÄÚMARIE, WHAT IS IT?‚ÄÙ HE CRIED WITH PAINFUL ALARM.

‚ÄÚHOW COULD YOU, HOW COULD YOU ‚Ä¶ OH, YOU UNGRATEFUL MAN!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMARIE, FORGIVE ME, MARIE ‚Ä¶ I ONLY ASKED YOU WHAT HIS NAME SHOULD BE. I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIVAN, IVAN.‚ÄÙ SHE RAISED HER FLUSHED AND TEAR-STAINED FACE. ‚ÄÚHOW COULD YOU SUPPOSE WE SHOULD CALL HIM BY ANOTHER HORRIBLE NAME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMARIE, CALM YOURSELF; OH, WHAT A NERVOUS STATE YOU ARE IN!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS RUDE AGAIN, PUTTING IT DOWN TO MY NERVES. I BET THAT IF I‚ÄÔD SAID HIS NAME WAS TO BE THAT OTHER ‚Ä¶ HORRIBLE NAME, YOU‚ÄÔD HAVE AGREED AT ONCE AND NOT HAVE NOTICED IT EVEN! OH, MEN, THE MEAN UNGRATEFUL CREATURES, THEY ARE ALL ALIKE!‚ÄÙ

A MINUTE LATER, OF COURSE, THEY WERE RECONCILED. SHATOV PERSUADED HER TO HAVE A NAP. SHE FELL ASLEEP BUT STILL KEPT HIS HAND IN HERS; SHE WAKED UP FREQUENTLY, LOOKED AT HIM, AS THOUGH AFRAID HE WOULD GO AWAY, AND DROPPED ASLEEP AGAIN.

KIRILLOV SENT AN OLD WOMAN ‚ÄÚTO CONGRATULATE THEM,‚ÄÙ AS WELL AS SOME HOT TEA, SOME FRESHLY COOKED CUTLETS, AND SOME BROTH AND WHITE BREAD FOR MARYA IGNATYEVNA. THE PATIENT SIPPED THE BROTH GREEDILY, THE OLD WOMAN UNDID THE BABY‚ÄÔS WRAPPINGS AND SWADDLED IT AFRESH, MARIE MADE SHATOV HAVE A CUTLET TOO.

TIME WAS PASSING. SHATOV, EXHAUSTED, FELL ASLEEP HIMSELF IN HIS CHAIR, WITH HIS HEAD ON MARIE‚ÄÔS PILLOW. SO THEY WERE FOUND BY ARINA PROHOROVNA, WHO KEPT HER WORD. SHE WAKED THEM UP GAILY, ASKED MARIE SOME NECESSARY QUESTIONS, EXAMINED THE BABY, AND AGAIN FORBADE SHATOV TO LEAVE HER. THEN, JESTING AT THE ‚ÄÚHAPPY COUPLE,‚ÄÙ WITH A SHADE OF CONTEMPT AND SUPERCILIOUSNESS SHE WENT AWAY AS WELL SATISFIED AS BEFORE.

IT WAS QUITE DARK WHEN SHATOV WAKED UP. HE MADE HASTE TO LIGHT THE CANDLE AND RAN FOR THE OLD WOMAN; BUT HE HAD HARDLY BEGUN TO GO DOWN THE STAIRS WHEN HE WAS STRUCK BY THE SOUND OF THE SOFT, DELIBERATE STEPS OF SOMEONE COMING UP TOWARDS HIM. ERKEL CAME IN.

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT COME IN,‚ÄÙ WHISPERED SHATOV, AND IMPULSIVELY SEIZING HIM BY THE HAND HE DREW HIM BACK TOWARDS THE GATE. ‚ÄÚWAIT HERE, I‚ÄÔLL COME DIRECTLY, I‚ÄÔD COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN YOU, COMPLETELY! OH, HOW YOU BROUGHT IT BACK!‚ÄÙ

HE WAS IN SUCH HASTE THAT HE DID NOT EVEN RUN IN TO KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS, BUT ONLY CALLED THE OLD WOMAN. MARIE WAS IN DESPAIR AND INDIGNATION THAT ‚ÄÚHE COULD DREAM OF LEAVING HER ALONE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED ECSTATICALLY, ‚ÄÚTHIS IS THE VERY LAST STEP! AND THEN FOR A NEW LIFE AND WE‚ÄÔLL NEVER, NEVER THINK OF THE OLD HORRORS AGAIN!‚ÄÙ

HE SOMEHOW APPEASED HER AND PROMISED TO BE BACK AT NINE O‚ÄÔCLOCK; HE KISSED HER WARMLY, KISSED THE BABY AND RAN DOWN QUICKLY TO ERKEL.

THEY SET OFF TOGETHER TO STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS PARK AT SKVORESHNIKI, WHERE, IN A SECLUDED PLACE AT THE VERY EDGE OF THE PARK WHERE IT ADJOINED THE PINE WOOD, HE HAD, EIGHTEEN MONTHS BEFORE, BURIED THE PRINTING PRESS WHICH HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED TO HIM. IT WAS A WILD AND DESERTED PLACE, QUITE HIDDEN AND AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE STAVROGINS‚ÄÔ HOUSE. IT WAS TWO OR PERHAPS THREE MILES FROM FILIPOV‚ÄÔS HOUSE.

‚ÄÚARE WE GOING TO WALK ALL THE WAY? I‚ÄÔLL TAKE A CAB.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI PARTICULARLY BEG YOU NOT TO,‚ÄÙ REPLIED ERKEL.

THEY INSISTED ON THAT. A CABMAN WOULD BE A WITNESS.

‚ÄÚWELL ‚Ä¶ BOTHER! I DON‚ÄÔT CARE, ONLY TO MAKE AN END OF IT.‚ÄÙ

THEY WALKED VERY FAST.

‚ÄÚERKEL, YOU LITTLE BOY,‚ÄÙ CRIED SHATOV, ‚ÄÚHAVE YOU EVER BEEN HAPPY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU SEEM TO BE VERY HAPPY JUST NOW,‚ÄÙ OBSERVED ERKEL WITH CURIOSITY.





CHAPTER VI. A BUSY NIGHT

I

DURING THAT DAY VIRGINSKY HAD SPENT TWO HOURS IN RUNNING ROUND TO SEE THE MEMBERS OF THE QUINTET AND TO INFORM THEM THAT SHATOV WOULD CERTAINLY NOT GIVE INFORMATION, BECAUSE HIS WIFE HAD COME BACK AND GIVEN BIRTH TO A CHILD, AND NO ONE ‚ÄÚWHO KNEW ANYTHING OF HUMAN NATURE‚ÄÙ COULD SUPPOSE THAT SHATOV COULD BE A DANGER AT THIS MOMENT. BUT TO HIS DISCOMFITURE HE FOUND NONE OF THEM AT HOME EXCEPT ERKEL AND LYAMSHIN. ERKEL LISTENED IN SILENCE, LOOKING CANDIDLY INTO HIS EYES, AND IN ANSWER TO THE DIRECT QUESTION ‚ÄÚWOULD HE GO AT SIX O‚ÄÔCLOCK OR NOT?‚ÄÙ HE REPLIED WITH THE BRIGHTEST OF SMILES THAT ‚ÄÚOF COURSE HE WOULD GO.‚ÄÙ

LYAMSHIN WAS IN BED, SERIOUSLY ILL, AS IT SEEMED, WITH HIS HEAD COVERED WITH A QUILT. HE WAS ALARMED AT VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS COMING IN, AND AS SOON AS THE LATTER BEGAN SPEAKING HE WAVED HIM OFF FROM UNDER THE BEDCLOTHES, ENTREATING HIM TO LET HIM ALONE. HE LISTENED TO ALL HE SAID ABOUT SHATOV, HOWEVER, AND SEEMED FOR SOME REASON EXTREMELY STRUCK BY THE NEWS THAT VIRGINSKY HAD FOUND NO ONE AT HOME. IT SEEMED THAT LYAMSHIN KNEW ALREADY (THROUGH LIPUTIN) OF FEDKA‚ÄÔS DEATH, AND HURRIEDLY AND INCOHERENTLY TOLD VIRGINSKY ABOUT IT, AT WHICH THE LATTER SEEMED STRUCK IN HIS TURN. TO VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS DIRECT QUESTION, ‚ÄÚSHOULD THEY GO OR NOT?‚ÄÙ HE BEGAN SUDDENLY WAVING HIS HANDS AGAIN, ENTREATING HIM TO LET HIM ALONE, AND SAYING THAT IT WAS NOT HIS BUSINESS, AND THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT.

VIRGINSKY RETURNED HOME DEJECTED AND GREATLY ALARMED. IT WEIGHED UPON HIM THAT HE HAD TO HIDE IT FROM HIS FAMILY; HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO TELL HIS WIFE EVERYTHING; AND IF HIS FEVERISH BRAIN HAD NOT HATCHED A NEW IDEA AT THAT MOMENT, A NEW PLAN OF CONCILIATION FOR FURTHER ACTION, HE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN TO HIS BED LIKE LYAMSHIN. BUT THIS NEW IDEA SUSTAINED HIM; WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, HE BEGAN IMPATIENTLY AWAITING THE HOUR FIXED, AND SET OFF FOR THE APPOINTED SPOT EARLIER THAN WAS NECESSARY. IT WAS A VERY GLOOMY PLACE AT THE END OF THE HUGE PARK. I WENT THERE AFTERWARDS ON PURPOSE TO LOOK AT IT. HOW SINISTER IT MUST HAVE LOOKED ON THAT CHILL AUTUMN EVENING! IT WAS AT THE EDGE OF AN OLD WOOD BELONGING TO THE CROWN. HUGE ANCIENT PINES STOOD OUT AS VAGUE SOMBRE BLURS IN THE DARKNESS. IT WAS SO DARK THAT THEY COULD HARDLY SEE EACH OTHER TWO PACES OFF, BUT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, LIPUTIN, AND AFTERWARDS ERKEL, BROUGHT LANTERNS WITH THEM. AT SOME UNRECORDED DATE IN THE PAST A RATHER ABSURD-LOOKING GROTTO HAD FOR SOME REASON BEEN BUILT HERE OF ROUGH UNHEWN STONES. THE TABLE AND BENCHES IN THE GROTTO HAD LONG AGO DECAYED AND FALLEN. TWO HUNDRED PACES TO THE RIGHT WAS THE BANK OF THE THIRD POND OF THE PARK. THESE THREE PONDS STRETCHED ONE AFTER ANOTHER FOR A MILE FROM THE HOUSE TO THE VERY END OF THE PARK. ONE COULD SCARCELY IMAGINE THAT ANY NOISE, A SCREAM, OR EVEN A SHOT, COULD REACH THE INHABITANTS OF THE STAVROGINS‚ÄÔ DESERTED HOUSE. NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH‚ÄÔS DEPARTURE THE PREVIOUS DAY AND ALEXEY YEGORYTCH‚ÄÔS ABSENCE LEFT ONLY FIVE OR SIX PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE, ALL MORE OR LESS INVALIDED, SO TO SPEAK. IN ANY CASE IT MIGHT BE ASSUMED WITH PERFECT CONFIDENCE THAT IF CRIES OR SHOUTS FOR HELP WERE HEARD BY ANY OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE ISOLATED HOUSE THEY WOULD ONLY HAVE EXCITED TERROR; NO ONE WOULD HAVE MOVED FROM HIS WARM STOVE OR SNUG SHELF TO GIVE ASSISTANCE.

BY TWENTY PAST SIX ALMOST ALL OF THEM EXCEPT ERKEL, WHO HAD BEEN TOLD OFF TO FETCH SHATOV, HAD TURNED UP AT THE TRYSTING-PLACE. THIS TIME PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS NOT LATE; HE CAME WITH TOLKATCHENKO. TOLKATCHENKO LOOKED FROWNING AND ANXIOUS; ALL HIS ASSUMED DETERMINATION AND INSOLENT BRAVADO HAD VANISHED. HE SCARCELY LEFT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS SIDE, AND SEEMED TO HAVE BECOME ALL AT ONCE IMMENSELY DEVOTED TO HIM. HE WAS CONTINUALLY THRUSTING HIMSELF FORWARD TO WHISPER FUSSILY TO HIM, BUT THE LATTER SCARCELY ANSWERED HIM, OR MUTTERED SOMETHING IRRITABLY TO GET RID OF HIM.

SHIGALOV AND VIRGINSKY HAD ARRIVED RATHER BEFORE PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, AND AS SOON AS HE CAME THEY DREW A LITTLE APART IN PROFOUND AND OBVIOUSLY INTENTIONAL SILENCE. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH RAISED HIS LANTERN AND EXAMINED THEM WITH UNCEREMONIOUS AND INSULTING MINUTENESS. ‚ÄÚTHEY MEAN TO SPEAK,‚ÄÙ FLASHED THROUGH HIS MIND.

‚ÄÚISN‚ÄÔT LYAMSHIN HERE?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED VIRGINSKY. ‚ÄÚWHO SAID HE WAS ILL?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM HERE,‚ÄÙ RESPONDED LYAMSHIN, SUDDENLY COMING FROM BEHIND A TREE. HE WAS IN A WARM GREATCOAT AND THICKLY MUFFLED IN A RUG, SO THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO MAKE OUT HIS FACE EVEN WITH A LANTERN.

‚ÄÚSO LIPUTIN IS THE ONLY ONE NOT HERE?‚ÄÙ

LIPUTIN TOO CAME OUT OF THE GROTTO WITHOUT SPEAKING. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH RAISED THE LANTERN AGAIN.

‚ÄÚWHY WERE YOU HIDING IN THERE? WHY DIDN‚ÄÔT YOU COME OUT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI IMAGINE WE STILL KEEP THE RIGHT OF FREEDOM ‚Ä¶ OF OUR ACTIONS,‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN MUTTERED, THOUGH PROBABLY HE HARDLY KNEW WHAT HE WANTED TO EXPRESS.

‚ÄÚGENTLEMEN,‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, RAISING HIS VOICE FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOVE A WHISPER, WHICH PRODUCED AN EFFECT, ‚ÄÚI THINK YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT IT‚ÄÔS USELESS TO GO OVER THINGS AGAIN. EVERYTHING WAS SAID AND FULLY THRASHED OUT YESTERDAY, OPENLY AND DIRECTLY. BUT PERHAPS‚ÄÎAS I SEE FROM YOUR FACES‚ÄÎSOMEONE WANTS TO MAKE SOME STATEMENT; IN THAT CASE I BEG YOU TO MAKE HASTE. DAMN IT ALL! THERE‚ÄÔS NOT MUCH TIME, AND ERKEL MAY BRING HIM IN A MINUTE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE IS SURE TO BRING HIM,‚ÄÙ TOLKATCHENKO PUT IN FOR SOME REASON.

‚ÄÚIF I AM NOT MISTAKEN, THE PRINTING PRESS WILL BE HANDED OVER, TO BEGIN WITH?‚ÄÙ INQUIRED LIPUTIN, THOUGH AGAIN HE SEEMED HARDLY TO UNDERSTAND WHY HE ASKED THE QUESTION.

‚ÄÚOF COURSE. WHY SHOULD WE LOSE IT?‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, LIFTING THE LANTERN TO HIS FACE. ‚ÄÚBUT, YOU SEE, WE ALL AGREED YESTERDAY THAT IT WAS NOT REALLY NECESSARY TO TAKE IT. HE NEED ONLY SHOW YOU THE EXACT SPOT WHERE IT‚ÄÔS BURIED; WE CAN DIG IT UP AFTERWARDS FOR OURSELVES. I KNOW THAT IT‚ÄÔS SOMEWHERE TEN PACES FROM A CORNER OF THIS GROTTO. BUT, DAMN IT ALL! HOW COULD YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN, LIPUTIN? IT WAS AGREED THAT YOU SHOULD MEET HIM ALONE AND THAT WE SHOULD COME OUT AFTERWARDS.‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS STRANGE THAT YOU SHOULD ASK‚ÄÎOR DIDN‚ÄÔT YOU MEAN WHAT YOU SAID?‚ÄÙ

LIPUTIN KEPT GLOOMILY SILENT. ALL WERE SILENT. THE WIND SHOOK THE TOPS OF THE PINE-TREES.

‚ÄÚI TRUST, HOWEVER, GENTLEMEN, THAT EVERY ONE WILL DO HIS DUTY,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH RAPPED OUT IMPATIENTLY.

‚ÄÚI KNOW THAT SHATOV‚ÄÔS WIFE HAS COME BACK AND HAS GIVEN BIRTH TO A CHILD,‚ÄÙ VIRGINSKY SAID SUDDENLY, EXCITED AND GESTICULATING AND SCARCELY ABLE TO SPEAK DISTINCTLY. ‚ÄÚKNOWING WHAT HUMAN NATURE IS, WE CAN BE SURE THAT NOW HE WON‚ÄÔT GIVE INFORMATION ‚Ä¶ BECAUSE HE IS HAPPY.‚Ä¶ SO I WENT TO EVERY ONE THIS MORNING AND FOUND NO ONE AT HOME, SO PERHAPS NOW NOTHING NEED BE DONE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

HE STOPPED SHORT WITH A CATCH IN HIS BREATH.

‚ÄÚIF YOU SUDDENLY BECAME HAPPY, MR. VIRGINSKY,‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, STEPPING UP TO HIM, ‚ÄÚWOULD YOU ABANDON‚ÄÎNOT GIVING INFORMATION; THERE‚ÄÔS NO QUESTION OF THAT‚ÄÎBUT ANY PERILOUS PUBLIC ACTION WHICH YOU HAD PLANNED BEFORE YOU WERE HAPPY AND WHICH YOU REGARDED AS A DUTY AND OBLIGATION IN SPITE OF THE RISK AND LOSS OF HAPPINESS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, I WOULDN‚ÄÔT ABANDON IT! I WOULDN‚ÄÔT ON ANY ACCOUNT!‚ÄÙ SAID VIRGINSKY WITH ABSURD WARMTH, TWITCHING ALL OVER.

‚ÄÚYOU WOULD RATHER BE UNHAPPY AGAIN THAN BE A SCOUNDREL?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, YES.‚Ä¶ QUITE THE CONTRARY.‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔD RATHER BE A COMPLETE SCOUNDREL ‚Ä¶ THAT IS NO ‚Ä¶ NOT A SCOUNDREL AT ALL, BUT ON THE CONTRARY COMPLETELY UNHAPPY RATHER THAN A SCOUNDREL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL THEN, LET ME TELL YOU THAT SHATOV LOOKS ON THIS BETRAYAL AS A PUBLIC DUTY. IT‚ÄÔS HIS MOST CHERISHED CONVICTION, AND THE PROOF OF IT IS THAT HE RUNS SOME RISK HIMSELF; THOUGH, OF COURSE, THEY WILL PARDON HIM A GREAT DEAL FOR GIVING INFORMATION. A MAN LIKE THAT WILL NEVER GIVE UP THE IDEA. NO SORT OF HAPPINESS WOULD OVERCOME HIM. IN ANOTHER DAY HE‚ÄÔLL GO BACK ON IT, REPROACH HIMSELF, AND WILL GO STRAIGHT TO THE POLICE. WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, I DON‚ÄÔT SEE ANY HAPPINESS IN THE FACT THAT HIS WIFE HAS COME BACK AFTER THREE YEARS‚ÄÔ ABSENCE TO BEAR HIM A CHILD OF STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT NO ONE HAS SEEN SHATOV‚ÄÔS LETTER,‚ÄÙ SHIGALOV BROUGHT OUT ALL AT ONCE, EMPHATICALLY.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE SEEN IT,‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. ‚ÄÚIT EXISTS, AND ALL THIS IS AWFULLY STUPID, GENTLEMEN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAND I PROTEST ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ VIRGINSKY CRIED, BOILING OVER SUDDENLY: ‚ÄÚI PROTEST WITH ALL MY MIGHT.‚Ä¶ I WANT ‚Ä¶ THIS IS WHAT I WANT. I SUGGEST THAT WHEN HE ARRIVES WE ALL COME OUT AND QUESTION HIM, AND IF IT‚ÄÔS TRUE, WE INDUCE HIM TO REPENT OF IT; AND IF HE GIVES US HIS WORD OF HONOUR, LET HIM GO. IN ANY CASE WE MUST HAVE A TRIAL; IT MUST BE DONE AFTER TRIAL. WE MUSTN‚ÄÔT LIE IN WAIT FOR HIM AND THEN FALL UPON HIM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚRISK THE CAUSE ON HIS WORD OF HONOUR‚ÄÎTHAT‚ÄÔS THE ACME OF STUPIDITY! DAMNATION, HOW STUPID IT ALL IS NOW, GENTLEMEN! AND A PRETTY PART YOU ARE CHOOSING TO PLAY AT THE MOMENT OF DANGER!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI PROTEST, I PROTEST!‚ÄÙ VIRGINSKY PERSISTED.

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT BAWL, ANYWAY; WE SHAN‚ÄÔT HEAR THE SIGNAL. SHATOV, GENTLEMEN.‚Ä¶ (DAMNATION, HOW STUPID THIS IS NOW!) I‚ÄÔVE TOLD YOU ALREADY THAT SHATOV IS A SLAVOPHIL, THAT IS, ONE OF THE STUPIDEST SET OF PEOPLE.‚Ä¶ BUT, DAMN IT ALL, NEVER MIND, THAT‚ÄÔS NO MATTER! YOU PUT ME OUT!‚Ä¶ SHATOV IS AN EMBITTERED MAN, GENTLEMEN, AND SINCE HE HAS BELONGED TO THE PARTY, ANYWAY, WHETHER HE WANTED TO OR NO, I HAD HOPED TILL THE LAST MINUTE THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN OF SERVICE TO THE CAUSE AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE USE OF AS AN EMBITTERED MAN. I SPARED HIM AND WAS KEEPING HIM IN RESERVE, IN SPITE OF MOST EXACT INSTRUCTIONS.‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔVE SPARED HIM A HUNDRED TIMES MORE THAN HE DESERVED! BUT HE‚ÄÔS ENDED BY BETRAYING US.‚Ä¶ BUT, HANG IT ALL, I DON‚ÄÔT CARE! YOU‚ÄÔD BETTER TRY RUNNING AWAY NOW, ANY OF YOU! NO ONE OF YOU HAS THE RIGHT TO GIVE UP THE JOB! YOU CAN KISS HIM IF YOU LIKE, BUT YOU HAVEN‚ÄÔT THE RIGHT TO STAKE THE CAUSE ON HIS WORD OF HONOUR! THAT‚ÄÔS ACTING LIKE SWINE AND SPIES IN GOVERNMENT PAY!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHO‚ÄÔS A SPY IN GOVERNMENT PAY HERE?‚ÄÙ LIPUTIN FILTERED OUT.

‚ÄÚYOU, PERHAPS. YOU‚ÄÔD BETTER HOLD YOUR TONGUE, LIPUTIN; YOU TALK FOR THE SAKE OF TALKING, AS YOU ALWAYS DO. ALL MEN ARE SPIES, GENTLEMEN, WHO FUNK THEIR DUTY AT THE MOMENT OF DANGER. THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOME FOOLS WHO‚ÄÔLL RUN IN A PANIC AT THE LAST MOMENT AND CRY OUT, ‚ÄÒAIE, FORGIVE ME, AND I‚ÄÔLL GIVE THEM ALL AWAY!‚ÄÔ BUT LET ME TELL YOU, GENTLEMEN, NO BETRAYAL WOULD WIN YOU A PARDON NOW. EVEN IF YOUR SENTENCE WERE MITIGATED IT WOULD MEAN SIBERIA; AND, WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, THERE‚ÄÔS NO ESCAPING THE WEAPONS OF THE OTHER SIDE‚ÄÎAND THEIR WEAPONS ARE SHARPER THAN THE GOVERNMENT‚ÄÔS.‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS FURIOUS AND SAID MORE THAN HE MEANT TO. WITH A RESOLUTE AIR SHIGALOV TOOK THREE STEPS TOWARDS HIM. ‚ÄÚSINCE YESTERDAY EVENING I‚ÄÔVE THOUGHT OVER THE QUESTION,‚ÄÙ HE BEGAN, SPEAKING WITH HIS USUAL PEDANTRY AND ASSURANCE. (I BELIEVE THAT IF THE EARTH HAD GIVEN WAY UNDER HIS FEET HE WOULD NOT HAVE RAISED HIS VOICE NOR HAVE VARIED ONE TONE IN HIS METHODICAL EXPOSITION.) ‚ÄÚTHINKING THE MATTER OVER, I‚ÄÔVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PROJECTED MURDER IS NOT MERELY A WASTE OF PRECIOUS TIME WHICH MIGHT BE EMPLOYED IN A MORE SUITABLE AND BEFITTING MANNER, BUT PRESENTS, MOREOVER, THAT DEPLORABLE DEVIATION FROM THE NORMAL METHOD WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN MOST PREJUDICIAL TO THE CAUSE AND HAS DELAYED ITS TRIUMPH FOR SCORES OF YEARS, UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF SHALLOW THINKERS AND PRE-EMINENTLY OF MEN OF POLITICAL INSTEAD OF PURELY SOCIALISTIC LEANINGS. I HAVE COME HERE SOLELY TO PROTEST AGAINST THE PROJECTED ENTERPRISE, FOR THE GENERAL EDIFICATION, INTENDING THEN TO WITHDRAW AT THE ACTUAL MOMENT, WHICH YOU, FOR SOME REASON I DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND, SPEAK OF AS A MOMENT OF DANGER TO YOU. I AM GOING‚ÄÎNOT FROM FEAR OF THAT DANGER NOR FROM A SENTIMENTAL FEELING FOR SHATOV, WHOM I HAVE NO INCLINATION TO KISS, BUT SOLELY BECAUSE ALL THIS BUSINESS FROM BEGINNING TO END IS IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION TO MY PROGRAMME. AS FOR MY BETRAYING YOU AND MY BEING IN THE PAY OF THE GOVERNMENT, YOU CAN SET YOUR MIND COMPLETELY AT REST. I SHALL NOT BETRAY YOU.‚ÄÙ

HE TURNED AND WALKED AWAY.

‚ÄÚDAMN IT ALL, HE‚ÄÔLL MEET THEM AND WARN SHATOV!‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, PULLING OUT HIS REVOLVER. THEY HEARD THE CLICK OF THE TRIGGER.

‚ÄÚYOU MAY BE CONFIDENT,‚ÄÙ SAID SHIGALOV, TURNING ONCE MORE, ‚ÄÚTHAT IF I MEET SHATOV ON THE WAY I MAY BOW TO HIM, BUT I SHALL NOT WARN HIM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT DO YOU KNOW, YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS, MR. FOURIER?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI BEG YOU TO OBSERVE THAT I AM NOT FOURIER. IF YOU MIX ME UP WITH THAT MAWKISH THEORETICAL TWADDLER YOU SIMPLY PROVE THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING OF MY MANUSCRIPT, THOUGH IT HAS BEEN IN YOUR HANDS. AS FOR YOUR VENGEANCE, LET ME TELL YOU THAT IT‚ÄÔS A MISTAKE TO COCK YOUR PISTOL: THAT‚ÄÔS ABSOLUTELY AGAINST YOUR INTERESTS AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. BUT IF YOU THREATEN TO SHOOT ME TO-MORROW, OR THE DAY AFTER, YOU‚ÄÔLL GAIN NOTHING BY IT BUT UNNECESSARY TROUBLE. YOU MAY KILL ME, BUT SOONER OR LATER YOU‚ÄÔLL COME TO MY SYSTEM ALL THE SAME. GOOD-BYE.‚ÄÙ

AT THAT INSTANT A WHISTLE WAS HEARD IN THE PARK, TWO HUNDRED PACES AWAY FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE POND. LIPUTIN AT ONCE ANSWERED, WHISTLING ALSO AS HAD BEEN AGREED THE EVENING BEFORE. (AS HE HAD LOST SEVERAL TEETH AND DISTRUSTED HIS OWN POWERS, HE HAD THIS MORNING BOUGHT FOR A FARTHING IN THE MARKET A CHILD‚ÄÔS CLAY WHISTLE FOR THE PURPOSE.) ERKEL HAD WARNED SHATOV ON THE WAY THAT THEY WOULD WHISTLE AS A SIGNAL, SO THAT THE LATTER FELT NO UNEASINESS.

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT BE UNEASY, I‚ÄÔLL AVOID THEM AND THEY WON‚ÄÔT NOTICE ME AT ALL,‚ÄÙ SHIGALOV DECLARED IN AN IMPRESSIVE WHISPER; AND THEREUPON DELIBERATELY AND WITHOUT HASTE HE WALKED HOME THROUGH THE DARK PARK.

EVERYTHING, TO THE SMALLEST DETAIL OF THIS TERRIBLE AFFAIR, IS NOW FULLY KNOWN. TO BEGIN WITH, LIPUTIN MET ERKEL AND SHATOV AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE GROTTO. SHATOV DID NOT BOW OR OFFER HIM HIS HAND, BUT AT ONCE PRONOUNCED HURRIEDLY IN A LOUD VOICE:

‚ÄÚWELL, WHERE HAVE YOU PUT THE SPADE, AND HAVEN‚ÄÔT YOU ANOTHER LANTERN? YOU NEEDN‚ÄÔT BE AFRAID, THERE‚ÄÔS ABSOLUTELY NO ONE HERE, AND THEY WOULDN‚ÄÔT HEAR AT SKVORESHNIKI NOW IF WE FIRED A CANNON HERE. THIS IS THE PLACE, HERE THIS VERY SPOT.‚ÄÙ

AND HE STAMPED WITH HIS FOOT TEN PACES FROM THE END OF THE GROTTO TOWARDS THE WOOD. AT THAT MOMENT TOLKATCHENKO RUSHED OUT FROM BEHIND A TREE AND SPRANG AT HIM FROM BEHIND, WHILE ERKEL SEIZED HIM BY THE ELBOWS. LIPUTIN ATTACKED HIM FROM THE FRONT. THE THREE OF THEM AT ONCE KNOCKED HIM DOWN AND PINNED HIM TO THE GROUND. AT THIS POINT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH DARTED UP WITH HIS REVOLVER. IT IS SAID THAT SHATOV HAD TIME TO TURN HIS HEAD AND WAS ABLE TO SEE AND RECOGNISE HIM. THREE LANTERNS LIGHTED UP THE SCENE. SHATOV SUDDENLY UTTERED A SHORT AND DESPERATE SCREAM. BUT THEY DID NOT LET HIM GO ON SCREAMING. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH FIRMLY AND ACCURATELY PUT HIS REVOLVER TO SHATOV‚ÄÔS FOREHEAD, PRESSED IT TO IT, AND PULLED THE TRIGGER. THE SHOT SEEMS NOT TO HAVE BEEN LOUD; NOTHING WAS HEARD AT SKVORESHNIKI, ANYWAY. SHIGALOV, WHO WAS SCARCELY THREE PACES AWAY, OF COURSE HEARD IT‚ÄÎHE HEARD THE SHOUT AND THE SHOT, BUT, AS HE TESTIFIED AFTERWARDS, HE DID NOT TURN NOR EVEN STOP. DEATH WAS ALMOST INSTANTANEOUS. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO PRESERVED ALL HIS FACULTIES, BUT I DON‚ÄÔT THINK HE WAS QUITE COOL. SQUATTING ON HIS HEELS, HE SEARCHED THE MURDERED MAN‚ÄÔS POCKETS HASTILY, THOUGH WITH STEADY HAND. NO MONEY WAS FOUND (HIS PURSE HAD BEEN LEFT UNDER MARYA IGNATYEVNA‚ÄÔS PILLOW). TWO OR THREE SCRAPS OF PAPER OF NO IMPORTANCE WERE FOUND: A NOTE FROM HIS OFFICE, THE TITLE OF SOME BOOK, AND AN OLD BILL FROM A RESTAURANT ABROAD WHICH HAD BEEN PRESERVED, GOODNESS KNOWS WHY, FOR TWO YEARS IN HIS POCKET. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH TRANSFERRED THESE SCRAPS OF PAPER TO HIS OWN POCKET, AND SUDDENLY NOTICING THAT THEY HAD ALL GATHERED ROUND, WERE GAZING AT THE CORPSE AND DOING NOTHING, HE BEGAN RUDELY AND ANGRILY ABUSING THEM AND URGING THEM ON. TOLKATCHENKO AND ERKEL RECOVERED THEMSELVES, AND RUNNING TO THE GROTTO BROUGHT INSTANTLY FROM IT TWO STONES WHICH THEY HAD GOT READY THERE THAT MORNING. THESE STONES, WHICH WEIGHED ABOUT TWENTY POUNDS EACH, WERE SECURELY TIED WITH CORD. AS THEY INTENDED TO THROW THE BODY IN THE NEAREST OF THE THREE PONDS, THEY PROCEEDED TO TIE THE STONES TO THE HEAD AND FEET RESPECTIVELY. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH FASTENED THE STONES WHILE TOLKATCHENKO AND ERKEL ONLY HELD AND PASSED THEM. ERKEL WAS FOREMOST, AND WHILE PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, GRUMBLING AND SWEARING, TIED THE DEAD MAN‚ÄÔS FEET TOGETHER WITH THE CORD AND FASTENED THE STONE TO THEM‚ÄÎA RATHER LENGTHY OPERATION‚ÄÎTOLKATCHENKO STOOD HOLDING THE OTHER STONE AT ARM‚ÄÔS-LENGTH, HIS WHOLE PERSON BENDING FORWARD, AS IT WERE, DEFERENTIALLY, TO BE IN READINESS TO HAND IT WITHOUT DELAY. IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO HIM TO LAY HIS BURDEN ON THE GROUND IN THE INTERVAL. WHEN AT LAST BOTH STONES WERE TIED ON AND PYOTR STEPANOVITCH GOT UP FROM THE GROUND TO SCRUTINISE THE FACES OF HIS COMPANIONS, SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENED, UTTERLY UNEXPECTED AND SURPRISING TO ALMOST EVERY ONE.

AS I HAVE SAID ALREADY, ALL EXCEPT PERHAPS TOLKATCHENKO AND ERKEL WERE STANDING STILL DOING NOTHING. THOUGH VIRGINSKY HAD RUSHED UP TO SHATOV WITH THE OTHERS HE HAD NOT SEIZED HIM OR HELPED TO HOLD HIM. LYAMSHIN HAD JOINED THE GROUP AFTER THE SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED. AFTERWARDS, WHILE PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS BUSY WITH THE CORPSE‚ÄÎFOR PERHAPS TEN MINUTES‚ÄÎNONE OF THEM SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN FULLY CONSCIOUS. THEY GROUPED THEMSELVES AROUND AND SEEMED TO HAVE FELT AMAZEMENT RATHER THAN ANXIETY OR ALARM. LIPUTIN STOOD FOREMOST, CLOSE TO THE CORPSE. VIRGINSKY STOOD BEHIND HIM, PEEPING OVER HIS SHOULDER WITH A PECULIAR, AS IT WERE UNCONCERNED, CURIOSITY; HE EVEN STOOD ON TIPTOE TO GET A BETTER VIEW. LYAMSHIN HID BEHIND VIRGINSKY. HE TOOK AN APPREHENSIVE PEEP FROM TIME TO TIME AND SLIPPED BEHIND HIM AGAIN AT ONCE. WHEN THE STONES HAD BEEN TIED ON AND PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD RISEN TO HIS FEET, VIRGINSKY BEGAN FAINTLY SHUDDERING ALL OVER, CLASPED HIS HANDS, AND CRIED OUT BITTERLY AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE:

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS NOT THE RIGHT THING, IT‚ÄÔS NOT, IT‚ÄÔS NOT AT ALL!‚ÄÙ HE WOULD PERHAPS HAVE ADDED SOMETHING MORE TO HIS BELATED EXCLAMATION, BUT LYAMSHIN DID NOT LET HIM FINISH: HE SUDDENLY SEIZED HIM FROM BEHIND AND SQUEEZED HIM WITH ALL HIS MIGHT, UTTERING AN UNNATURAL SHRIEK. THERE ARE MOMENTS OF VIOLENT EMOTION, OF TERROR, FOR INSTANCE, WHEN A MAN WILL CRY OUT IN A VOICE NOT HIS OWN, UNLIKE ANYTHING ONE COULD HAVE ANTICIPATED FROM HIM, AND THIS HAS SOMETIMES A VERY TERRIBLE EFFECT. LYAMSHIN GAVE VENT TO A SCREAM MORE ANIMAL THAN HUMAN. SQUEEZING VIRGINSKY FROM BEHIND MORE AND MORE TIGHTLY AND CONVULSIVELY, HE WENT ON SHRIEKING WITHOUT A PAUSE, HIS MOUTH WIDE OPEN AND HIS EYES STARTING OUT OF HIS HEAD, KEEPING UP A CONTINUAL PATTER WITH HIS FEET, AS THOUGH HE WERE BEATING A DRUM. VIRGINSKY WAS SO SCARED THAT HE TOO SCREAMED OUT LIKE A MADMAN, AND WITH A FEROCITY, A VINDICTIVENESS THAT ONE COULD NEVER HAVE EXPECTED OF VIRGINSKY. HE TRIED TO PULL HIMSELF AWAY FROM LYAMSHIN, SCRATCHING AND PUNCHING HIM AS FAR AS HE COULD WITH HIS ARMS BEHIND HIM. ERKEL AT LAST HELPED TO PULL LYAMSHIN AWAY. BUT WHEN, IN HIS TERROR, VIRGINSKY HAD SKIPPED TEN PACES AWAY FROM HIM, LYAMSHIN, CATCHING SIGHT OF PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, BEGAN YELLING AGAIN AND FLEW AT HIM. STUMBLING OVER THE CORPSE, HE FELL UPON PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, PRESSING HIS HEAD TO THE LATTER‚ÄÔS CHEST AND GRIPPING HIM SO TIGHTLY IN HIS ARMS THAT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, TOLKATCHENKO, AND LIPUTIN COULD ALL OF THEM DO NOTHING AT THE FIRST MOMENT. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SHOUTED, SWORE, BEAT HIM ON THE HEAD WITH HIS FISTS. AT LAST, WRENCHING HIMSELF AWAY, HE DREW HIS REVOLVER AND PUT IT IN THE OPEN MOUTH OF LYAMSHIN, WHO WAS STILL YELLING AND WAS BY NOW TIGHTLY HELD BY TOLKATCHENKO, ERKEL, AND LIPUTIN. BUT LYAMSHIN WENT ON SHRIEKING IN SPITE OF THE REVOLVER. AT LAST ERKEL, CRUSHING HIS SILK HANDKERCHIEF INTO A BALL, DEFTLY THRUST IT INTO HIS MOUTH AND THE SHRIEK CEASED. MEANTIME TOLKATCHENKO TIED HIS HANDS WITH WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE ROPE.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS VERY STRANGE,‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, SCRUTINISING THE MADMAN WITH UNEASY WONDER. HE WAS EVIDENTLY STRUCK. ‚ÄÚI EXPECTED SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT FROM HIM,‚ÄÙ HE ADDED THOUGHTFULLY.

THEY LEFT ERKEL IN CHARGE OF HIM FOR A TIME. THEY HAD TO MAKE HASTE TO GET RID OF THE CORPSE: THERE HAD BEEN SO MUCH NOISE THAT SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE HEARD. TOLKATCHENKO AND PYOTR STEPANOVITCH TOOK UP THE LANTERNS AND LIFTED THE CORPSE BY THE HEAD, WHILE LIPUTIN AND VIRGINSKY TOOK THE FEET, AND SO THEY CARRIED IT AWAY. WITH THE TWO STONES IT WAS A HEAVY BURDEN, AND THE DISTANCE WAS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED PACES. TOLKATCHENKO WAS THE STRONGEST OF THEM. HE ADVISED THEM TO KEEP IN STEP, BUT NO ONE ANSWERED HIM AND THEY ALL WALKED ANYHOW. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WALKED ON THE RIGHT AND, BENDING FORWARD, CARRIED THE DEAD MAN‚ÄÔS HEAD ON HIS SHOULDER WHILE WITH THE LEFT HAND HE SUPPORTED THE STONE. AS TOLKATCHENKO WALKED MORE THAN HALF THE WAY WITHOUT THINKING OF HELPING HIM WITH THE STONE, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH AT LAST SHOUTED AT HIM WITH AN OATH. IT WAS A SINGLE, SUDDEN SHOUT. THEY ALL WENT ON CARRYING THE BODY IN SILENCE, AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN THEY REACHED THE POND THAT VIRGINSKY, STOOPING UNDER HIS BURDEN AND SEEMING TO BE EXHAUSTED BY THE WEIGHT OF IT, CRIED OUT AGAIN IN THE SAME LOUD AND WAILING VOICE:

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS NOT THE RIGHT THING, NO, NO, IT‚ÄÔS NOT THE RIGHT THING!‚ÄÙ

THE PLACE TO WHICH THEY CARRIED THE DEAD MAN AT THE EXTREME END OF THE RATHER LARGE POND, WHICH WAS THE FARTHEST OF THE THREE FROM THE HOUSE, WAS ONE OF THE MOST SOLITARY AND UNFREQUENTED SPOTS IN THE PARK, ESPECIALLY AT THIS LATE SEASON OF THE YEAR. AT THAT END THE POND WAS OVERGROWN WITH WEEDS BY THE BANKS. THEY PUT DOWN THE LANTERN, SWUNG THE CORPSE AND THREW IT INTO THE POND. THEY HEARD A MUFFLED AND PROLONGED SPLASH. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH RAISED THE LANTERN AND EVERY ONE FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE, PEERING CURIOUSLY TO SEE THE BODY SINK, BUT NOTHING COULD BE SEEN: WEIGHTED WITH THE TWO STONES, THE BODY SANK AT ONCE. THE BIG RIPPLES SPREAD OVER THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AND QUICKLY PASSED AWAY. IT WAS OVER.

VIRGINSKY WENT OFF WITH ERKEL, WHO BEFORE GIVING UP LYAMSHIN TO TOLKATCHENKO BROUGHT HIM TO PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, REPORTING TO THE LATTER THAT LYAMSHIN HAD COME TO HIS SENSES, WAS PENITENT AND BEGGED FORGIVENESS, AND INDEED HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WALKED OFF ALONE, GOING ROUND BY THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE POND, SKIRTING THE PARK. THIS WAS THE LONGEST WAY. TO HIS SURPRISE LIPUTIN OVERTOOK HIM BEFORE HE GOT HALF-WAY HOME.

‚ÄÚPYOTR STEPANOVITCH! PYOTR STEPANOVITCH! LYAMSHIN WILL GIVE INFORMATION!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, HE WILL COME TO HIS SENSES AND REALISE THAT HE WILL BE THE FIRST TO GO TO SIBERIA IF HE DID. NO ONE WILL BETRAY US NOW. EVEN YOU WON‚ÄÔT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT ABOUT YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO FEAR! I‚ÄÔLL GET YOU ALL OUT OF THE WAY THE MINUTE YOU ATTEMPT TO TURN TRAITORS, AND YOU KNOW THAT. BUT YOU WON‚ÄÔT TURN TRAITORS. HAVE YOU RUN A MILE AND A HALF TO TELL ME THAT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPYOTR STEPANOVITCH, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, PERHAPS WE SHALL NEVER MEET AGAIN!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS PUT THAT INTO YOUR HEAD?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚONLY TELL ME ONE THING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, WHAT? THOUGH I WANT YOU TO TAKE YOURSELF OFF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚONE QUESTION, BUT ANSWER IT TRULY: ARE WE THE ONLY QUINTET IN THE WORLD, OR IS IT TRUE THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF OTHERS? IT‚ÄÔS A QUESTION OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO ME, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SEE THAT FROM THE FRANTIC STATE YOU ARE IN. BUT DO YOU KNOW, LIPUTIN, YOU ARE MORE DANGEROUS THAN LYAMSHIN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI KNOW, I KNOW; BUT THE ANSWER, YOUR ANSWER!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE A STUPID FELLOW! I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT COULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU NOW WHETHER IT‚ÄÔS THE ONLY QUINTET OR ONE OF A THOUSAND.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT MEANS IT‚ÄÔS THE ONLY ONE! I WAS SURE OF IT ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ CRIED LIPUTIN. ‚ÄÚI ALWAYS KNEW IT WAS THE ONLY ONE, I KNEW IT ALL ALONG.‚ÄÙ AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY REPLY HE TURNED AND QUICKLY VANISHED INTO THE DARKNESS.

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH PONDERED A LITTLE.

‚ÄÚNO, NO ONE WILL TURN TRAITOR,‚ÄÙ HE CONCLUDED WITH DECISION, ‚ÄÚBUT THE GROUP MUST REMAIN A GROUP AND OBEY, OR I‚ÄÔLL ‚Ä¶ WHAT A WRETCHED SET THEY ARE THOUGH!‚ÄÙ

II

HE FIRST WENT HOME, AND CAREFULLY, WITHOUT HASTE, PACKED HIS TRUNK. AT SIX O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE MORNING THERE WAS A SPECIAL TRAIN FROM THE TOWN. THIS EARLY MORNING EXPRESS ONLY RAN ONCE A WEEK, AND WAS ONLY A RECENT EXPERIMENT. THOUGH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD TOLD THE MEMBERS OF THE QUINTET THAT HE WAS ONLY GOING TO BE AWAY FOR A SHORT TIME IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, HIS INTENTIONS, AS APPEARED LATER, WERE IN REALITY VERY DIFFERENT. HAVING FINISHED PACKING, HE SETTLED ACCOUNTS WITH HIS LANDLADY TO WHOM HE HAD PREVIOUSLY GIVEN NOTICE OF HIS DEPARTURE, AND DROVE IN A CAB TO ERKEL‚ÄÔS LODGINGS, NEAR THE STATION. AND THEN JUST UPON ONE O‚ÄÔCLOCK AT NIGHT HE WALKED TO KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS, APPROACHING AS BEFORE BY FEDKA‚ÄÔS SECRET WAY.

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS IN A PAINFUL STATE OF MIND. APART FROM OTHER EXTREMELY GRAVE REASONS FOR DISSATISFACTION (HE WAS STILL UNABLE TO LEARN ANYTHING OF STAVROGIN), HE HAD, IT SEEMS‚ÄÎFOR I CANNOT ASSERT IT FOR A FACT‚ÄÎRECEIVED IN THE COURSE OF THAT DAY, PROBABLY FROM PETERSBURG, SECRET INFORMATION OF A DANGER AWAITING HIM IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE. THERE ARE, OF COURSE, MANY LEGENDS IN THE TOWN RELATING TO THIS PERIOD; BUT IF ANY FACTS WERE KNOWN, IT WAS ONLY TO THOSE IMMEDIATELY CONCERNED. I CAN ONLY SURMISE AS MY OWN CONJECTURE THAT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH MAY WELL HAVE HAD AFFAIRS GOING ON IN OTHER NEIGHBOURHOODS AS WELL AS IN OUR TOWN, SO THAT HE REALLY MAY HAVE RECEIVED SUCH A WARNING. I AM CONVINCED, INDEED, IN SPITE OF LIPUTIN‚ÄÔS CYNICAL AND DESPAIRING DOUBTS, THAT HE REALLY HAD TWO OR THREE OTHER QUINTETS; FOR INSTANCE, IN PETERSBURG AND MOSCOW, AND IF NOT QUINTETS AT LEAST COLLEAGUES AND CORRESPONDENTS, AND POSSIBLY WAS IN VERY CURIOUS RELATIONS WITH THEM. NOT MORE THAN THREE DAYS AFTER HIS DEPARTURE AN ORDER FOR HIS IMMEDIATE ARREST ARRIVED FROM PETERSBURG‚ÄÎWHETHER IN CONNECTION WITH WHAT HAD HAPPENED AMONG US, OR ELSEWHERE, I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW. THIS ORDER ONLY SERVED TO INCREASE THE OVERWHELMING, ALMOST PANIC TERROR WHICH SUDDENLY CAME UPON OUR LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE SOCIETY OF THE TOWN, TILL THEN SO PERSISTENTLY FRIVOLOUS IN ITS ATTITUDE, ON THE DISCOVERY OF THE MYSTERIOUS AND PORTENTOUS MURDER OF THE STUDENT SHATOV‚ÄÎTHE CLIMAX OF THE LONG SERIES OF SENSELESS ACTIONS IN OUR MIDST‚ÄÎAS WELL AS THE EXTREMELY MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ACCOMPANIED THAT MURDER. BUT THE ORDER CAME TOO LATE: PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS ALREADY IN PETERSBURG, LIVING UNDER ANOTHER NAME, AND, LEARNING WHAT WAS GOING ON, HE MADE HASTE TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE ABROAD.‚Ä¶ BUT I AM ANTICIPATING IN A SHOCKING WAY.

HE WENT IN TO KIRILLOV, LOOKING ILL-HUMOURED AND QUARRELSOME. APART FROM THE REAL TASK BEFORE HIM, HE FELT, AS IT WERE, TEMPTED TO SATISFY SOME PERSONAL GRUDGE, TO AVENGE HIMSELF ON KIRILLOV FOR SOMETHING. KIRILLOV SEEMED PLEASED TO SEE HIM; HE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN EXPECTING HIM A LONG TIME WITH PAINFUL IMPATIENCE. HIS FACE WAS PALER THAN USUAL; THERE WAS A FIXED AND HEAVY LOOK IN HIS BLACK EYES.

‚ÄÚI THOUGHT YOU WEREN‚ÄÔT COMING,‚ÄÙ HE BROUGHT OUT DREARILY FROM HIS CORNER OF THE SOFA, FROM WHICH HE HAD NOT, HOWEVER, MOVED TO GREET HIM.

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH STOOD BEFORE HIM AND, BEFORE UTTERING A WORD, LOOKED INTENTLY AT HIS FACE.

‚ÄÚEVERYTHING IS IN ORDER, THEN, AND WE ARE NOT DRAWING BACK FROM OUR RESOLUTION. BRAVO!‚ÄÙ HE SMILED AN OFFENSIVELY PATRONISING SMILE. ‚ÄÚBUT, AFTER ALL,‚ÄÙ HE ADDED WITH UNPLEASANT JOCOSITY, ‚ÄÚIF I AM BEHIND MY TIME, IT‚ÄÔS NOT FOR YOU TO COMPLAIN: I MADE YOU A PRESENT OF THREE HOURS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT WANT EXTRA HOURS AS A PRESENT FROM YOU, AND YOU CAN‚ÄÔT MAKE ME A PRESENT ‚Ä¶ YOU FOOL!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT?‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS STARTLED, BUT INSTANTLY CONTROLLED HIMSELF. ‚ÄÚWHAT HUFFINESS! SO WE ARE IN A SAVAGE TEMPER?‚ÄÙ HE RAPPED OUT, STILL WITH THE SAME OFFENSIVE SUPERCILIOUSNESS. ‚ÄÚAT SUCH A MOMENT COMPOSURE IS WHAT YOU NEED. THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS TO CONSIDER YOURSELF A COLUMBUS AND ME A MOUSE, AND NOT TO TAKE OFFENCE AT ANYTHING I SAY. I GAVE YOU THAT ADVICE YESTERDAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO LOOK UPON YOU AS A MOUSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THAT, A COMPLIMENT? BUT THE TEA IS COLD‚ÄÎAND THAT SHOWS THAT EVERYTHING IS TOPSY-TURVY. BAH! BUT I SEE SOMETHING IN THE WINDOW, ON A PLATE.‚ÄÙ HE WENT TO THE WINDOW. ‚ÄÚOH OH, BOILED CHICKEN AND RICE!‚Ä¶ BUT WHY HAVEN‚ÄÔT YOU BEGUN UPON IT YET? SO WE ARE IN SUCH A STATE OF MIND THAT EVEN CHICKEN ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE DINED, AND IT‚ÄÔS NOT YOUR BUSINESS. HOLD YOUR TONGUE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, OF COURSE; BESIDES, IT‚ÄÔS NO CONSEQUENCE‚ÄÎTHOUGH FOR ME AT THE MOMENT IT IS OF CONSEQUENCE. ONLY FANCY, I SCARCELY HAD ANY DINNER, AND SO IF, AS I SUPPOSE, THAT CHICKEN IS NOT WANTED NOW ‚Ä¶ EH?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚEAT IT IF YOU CAN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHANK YOU, AND THEN I‚ÄÔLL HAVE TEA.‚ÄÙ

HE INSTANTLY SETTLED HIMSELF AT THE OTHER END OF THE SOFA AND FELL UPON THE CHICKEN WITH EXTRAORDINARY GREEDINESS; AT THE SAME TIME HE KEPT A CONSTANT WATCH ON HIS VICTIM. KIRILLOV LOOKED AT HIM FIXEDLY WITH ANGRY AVERSION, AS THOUGH UNABLE TO TEAR HIMSELF AWAY.

‚ÄÚI SAY, THOUGH,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH FIRED OFF SUDDENLY, WHILE HE STILL WENT ON EATING, ‚ÄÚWHAT ABOUT OUR BUSINESS? WE ARE NOT CRYING OFF, ARE WE? HOW ABOUT THAT DOCUMENT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE DECIDED IN THE NIGHT THAT IT‚ÄÔS NOTHING TO ME. I‚ÄÔLL WRITE IT. ABOUT THE MANIFESTOES?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, ABOUT THE MANIFESTOES TOO. BUT I‚ÄÔLL DICTATE IT. OF COURSE, THAT‚ÄÔS NOTHING TO YOU. CAN YOU POSSIBLY MIND WHAT‚ÄÔS IN THE LETTER AT SUCH A MOMENT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS NOT YOUR BUSINESS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS NOT MINE, OF COURSE. IT NEED ONLY BE A FEW LINES, THOUGH: THAT YOU AND SHATOV DISTRIBUTED THE MANIFESTOES AND WITH THE HELP OF FEDKA, WHO HID IN YOUR LODGINGS. THIS LAST POINT ABOUT FEDKA AND YOUR LODGINGS IS VERY IMPORTANT‚ÄÎTHE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, INDEED. YOU SEE, I AM TALKING TO YOU QUITE OPENLY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSHATOV? WHY SHATOV? I WON‚ÄÔT MENTION SHATOV FOR ANYTHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT NEXT! WHAT IS IT TO YOU? YOU CAN‚ÄÔT HURT HIM NOW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHIS WIFE HAS COME BACK TO HIM. SHE HAS WAKED UP AND HAS SENT TO ASK ME WHERE HE IS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSHE HAS SENT TO ASK YOU WHERE HE IS? H‚ÄÔM ‚Ä¶ THAT‚ÄÔS UNFORTUNATE. SHE MAY SEND AGAIN; NO ONE OUGHT TO KNOW I AM HERE.‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS UNEASY.

‚ÄÚSHE WON‚ÄÔT KNOW, SHE‚ÄÔS GONE TO SLEEP AGAIN. THERE‚ÄÔS A MIDWIFE WITH HER, ARINA VIRGINSKY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSO THAT‚ÄÔS HOW IT WAS.‚Ä¶ SHE WON‚ÄÔT OVERHEAR, I SUPPOSE? I SAY, YOU‚ÄÔD BETTER SHUT THE FRONT DOOR.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSHE WON‚ÄÔT OVERHEAR ANYTHING. AND IF SHATOV COMES I‚ÄÔLL HIDE YOU IN ANOTHER ROOM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSHATOV WON‚ÄÔT COME; AND YOU MUST WRITE THAT YOU QUARRELLED WITH HIM BECAUSE HE TURNED TRAITOR AND INFORMED THE POLICE ‚Ä¶ THIS EVENING ‚Ä¶ AND CAUSED HIS DEATH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE IS DEAD!‚ÄÙ CRIED KIRILLOV, JUMPING UP FROM THE SOFA.

‚ÄÚHE DIED AT SEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK THIS EVENING, OR RATHER, AT SEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK YESTERDAY EVENING, AND NOW IT‚ÄÔS ONE O‚ÄÔCLOCK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU HAVE KILLED HIM!‚Ä¶ AND I FORESAW IT YESTERDAY!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO DOUBT YOU DID! WITH THIS REVOLVER HERE.‚ÄÙ (HE DREW OUT HIS REVOLVER AS THOUGH TO SHOW IT, BUT DID NOT PUT IT BACK AGAIN AND STILL HELD IT IN HIS RIGHT HAND AS THOUGH IN READINESS.) ‚ÄÚYOU ARE A STRANGE MAN, THOUGH, KIRILLOV; YOU KNEW YOURSELF THAT THE STUPID FELLOW WAS BOUND TO END LIKE THIS. WHAT WAS THERE TO FORESEE IN THAT? I MADE THAT AS PLAIN AS POSSIBLE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SHATOV WAS MEANING TO BETRAY US; I WAS WATCHING HIM, AND IT COULD NOT BE LEFT LIKE THAT. AND YOU TOO HAD INSTRUCTIONS TO WATCH HIM; YOU TOLD ME SO YOURSELF THREE WEEKS AGO.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOLD YOUR TONGUE! YOU‚ÄÔVE DONE THIS BECAUSE HE SPAT IN YOUR FACE IN GENEVA!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFOR THAT AND FOR OTHER THINGS TOO‚ÄÎFOR MANY OTHER THINGS; NOT FROM SPITE, HOWEVER. WHY DO YOU JUMP UP? WHY LOOK LIKE THAT? OH OH, SO THAT‚ÄÔS IT, IS IT?‚ÄÙ

HE JUMPED UP AND HELD OUT HIS REVOLVER BEFORE HIM. KIRILLOV HAD SUDDENLY SNATCHED UP FROM THE WINDOW HIS REVOLVER, WHICH HAD BEEN LOADED AND PUT READY SINCE THE MORNING. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH TOOK UP HIS POSITION AND AIMED HIS WEAPON AT KIRILLOV. THE LATTER LAUGHED ANGRILY.

‚ÄÚCONFESS, YOU SCOUNDREL, THAT YOU BROUGHT YOUR REVOLVER BECAUSE I MIGHT SHOOT YOU.‚Ä¶ BUT I SHAN‚ÄÔT SHOOT YOU ‚Ä¶ THOUGH ‚Ä¶ THOUGH ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

AND AGAIN HE TURNED HIS REVOLVER UPON PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, AS IT WERE REHEARSING, AS THOUGH UNABLE TO DENY HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF IMAGINING HOW HE WOULD SHOOT HIM. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, HOLDING HIS GROUND, WAITED FOR HIM, WAITED FOR HIM TILL THE LAST MINUTE WITHOUT PULLING THE TRIGGER, AT THE RISK OF BEING THE FIRST TO GET A BULLET IN HIS HEAD: IT MIGHT WELL BE EXPECTED OF ‚ÄÚTHE MANIAC.‚ÄÙ BUT AT LAST ‚ÄÚTHE MANIAC‚ÄÙ DROPPED HIS HAND, GASPING AND TREMBLING AND UNABLE TO SPEAK.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE PLAYED YOUR LITTLE GAME AND THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH.‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, TOO, DROPPED HIS WEAPON. ‚ÄÚI KNEW IT WAS ONLY A GAME; ONLY YOU RAN A RISK, LET ME TELL YOU: I MIGHT HAVE FIRED.‚ÄÙ

AND HE SAT DOWN ON THE SOFA WITH A FAIR SHOW OF COMPOSURE AND POURED HIMSELF OUT SOME TEA, THOUGH HIS HAND TREMBLED A LITTLE. KIRILLOV LAID HIS REVOLVER ON THE TABLE AND BEGAN WALKING UP AND DOWN.

‚ÄÚI WON‚ÄÔT WRITE THAT I KILLED SHATOV ‚Ä¶ AND I WON‚ÄÔT WRITE ANYTHING NOW. YOU WON‚ÄÔT HAVE A DOCUMENT!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SHAN‚ÄÔT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, YOU WON‚ÄÔT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT MEANNESS AND WHAT STUPIDITY!‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH TURNED GREEN WITH RESENTMENT. ‚ÄÚI FORESAW IT, THOUGH. YOU‚ÄÔVE NOT TAKEN ME BY SURPRISE, LET ME TELL YOU. AS YOU PLEASE, HOWEVER. IF I COULD MAKE YOU DO IT BY FORCE, I WOULD. YOU ARE A SCOUNDREL, THOUGH.‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS MORE AND MORE CARRIED AWAY AND UNABLE TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF. ‚ÄÚYOU ASKED US FOR MONEY OUT THERE AND PROMISED US NO END OF THINGS.‚Ä¶ I WON‚ÄÔT GO AWAY WITH NOTHING, HOWEVER: I‚ÄÔLL SEE YOU PUT THE BULLET THROUGH YOUR BRAINS FIRST, ANYWAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WANT YOU TO GO AWAY AT ONCE.‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV STOOD FIRMLY BEFORE HIM.

‚ÄÚNO, THAT‚ÄÔS IMPOSSIBLE.‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH TOOK UP HIS REVOLVER AGAIN. ‚ÄÚNOW IN YOUR SPITE AND COWARDICE YOU MAY THINK FIT TO PUT IT OFF AND TO TURN TRAITOR TO-MORROW, SO AS TO GET MONEY AGAIN; THEY‚ÄÔLL PAY YOU FOR THAT, OF COURSE. DAMN IT ALL, FELLOWS LIKE YOU ARE CAPABLE OF ANYTHING! ONLY DON‚ÄÔT TROUBLE YOURSELF; I‚ÄÔVE PROVIDED FOR ALL CONTINGENCIES: I AM NOT GOING TILL I‚ÄÔVE DASHED YOUR BRAINS OUT WITH THIS REVOLVER, AS I DID TO THAT SCOUNDREL SHATOV, IF YOU ARE AFRAID TO DO IT YOURSELF AND PUT OFF YOUR INTENTION, DAMN YOU!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE SET ON SEEING MY BLOOD, TOO?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM NOT ACTING FROM SPITE; LET ME TELL YOU, IT‚ÄÔS NOTHING TO ME. I AM DOING IT TO BE AT EASE ABOUT THE CAUSE. ONE CAN‚ÄÔT RELY ON MEN; YOU SEE THAT FOR YOURSELF. I DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND WHAT FANCY POSSESSES YOU TO PUT YOURSELF TO DEATH. IT WASN‚ÄÔT MY IDEA; YOU THOUGHT OF IT YOURSELF BEFORE I APPEARED, AND TALKED OF YOUR INTENTION TO THE COMMITTEE ABROAD BEFORE YOU SAID ANYTHING TO ME. AND YOU KNOW, NO ONE HAS FORCED IT OUT OF YOU; NO ONE OF THEM KNEW YOU, BUT YOU CAME TO CONFIDE IN THEM YOURSELF, FROM SENTIMENTALISM. AND WHAT‚ÄÔS TO BE DONE IF A PLAN OF ACTION HERE, WHICH CAN‚ÄÔT BE ALTERED NOW, WAS FOUNDED UPON THAT WITH YOUR CONSENT AND UPON YOUR SUGGESTION?‚Ä¶ YOUR SUGGESTION, MIND THAT! YOU HAVE PUT YOURSELF IN A POSITION IN WHICH YOU KNOW TOO MUCH. IF YOU ARE AN ASS AND GO OFF TO-MORROW TO INFORM THE POLICE, THAT WOULD BE RATHER A DISADVANTAGE TO US; WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT? YES, YOU‚ÄÔVE BOUND YOURSELF; YOU‚ÄÔVE GIVEN YOUR WORD, YOU‚ÄÔVE TAKEN MONEY. THAT YOU CAN‚ÄÔT DENY.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS MUCH EXCITED, BUT FOR SOME TIME PAST KIRILLOV HAD NOT BEEN LISTENING. HE PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM, LOST IN THOUGHT AGAIN.

‚ÄÚI AM SORRY FOR SHATOV,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, STOPPING BEFORE PYOTR STEPANOVITCH AGAIN.

‚ÄÚWHY SO? I AM SORRY, IF THAT‚ÄÔS ALL, AND DO YOU SUPPOSE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOLD YOUR TONGUE, YOU SCOUNDREL,‚ÄÙ ROARED KIRILLOV, MAKING AN ALARMING AND UNMISTAKABLE MOVEMENT; ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL KILL YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHERE, THERE, THERE! I TOLD A LIE, I ADMIT IT; I AM NOT SORRY AT ALL. COME, THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH, THAT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH.‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH STARTED UP APPREHENSIVELY, PUTTING OUT HIS HAND.

KIRILLOV SUBSIDED AND BEGAN WALKING UP AND DOWN AGAIN.

‚ÄÚI WON‚ÄÔT PUT IT OFF; I WANT TO KILL MYSELF NOW: ALL ARE SCOUNDRELS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, THAT‚ÄÔS AN IDEA; OF COURSE ALL ARE SCOUNDRELS; AND SINCE LIFE IS A BEASTLY THING FOR A DECENT MAN ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFOOL, I AM JUST SUCH A SCOUNDREL AS YOU, AS ALL, NOT A DECENT MAN. THERE‚ÄÔS NEVER BEEN A DECENT MAN ANYWHERE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS GUESSED THE TRUTH AT LAST! CAN YOU, KIRILLOV, WITH YOUR SENSE, HAVE FAILED TO SEE TILL NOW THAT ALL MEN ARE ALIKE, THAT THERE ARE NONE BETTER OR WORSE, ONLY SOME ARE STUPIDER, THAN OTHERS, AND THAT IF ALL ARE SCOUNDRELS (WHICH IS NONSENSE, THOUGH) THERE OUGHTN‚ÄÔT TO BE ANY PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚAH! WHY, YOU ARE REALLY IN EARNEST?‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV LOOKED AT HIM WITH SOME WONDER. ‚ÄÚYOU SPEAK WITH HEAT AND SIMPLY.‚Ä¶ CAN IT BE THAT EVEN FELLOWS LIKE YOU HAVE CONVICTIONS?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚKIRILLOV, I‚ÄÔVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOU MEAN TO KILL YOURSELF. I ONLY KNOW IT‚ÄÔS FROM CONVICTION ‚Ä¶ STRONG CONVICTION. BUT IF YOU FEEL A YEARNING TO EXPRESS YOURSELF, SO TO SAY, I AM AT YOUR SERVICE.‚Ä¶ ONLY YOU MUST THINK OF THE TIME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT TIME IS IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH OH, JUST TWO.‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND LIGHTED A CIGARETTE.

‚ÄÚIT SEEMS WE CAN COME TO TERMS AFTER ALL,‚ÄÙ HE REFLECTED.

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE NOTHING TO SAY TO YOU,‚ÄÙ MUTTERED KIRILLOV.

‚ÄÚI REMEMBER THAT SOMETHING ABOUT GOD COMES INTO IT ‚Ä¶ YOU EXPLAINED IT TO ME ONCE‚ÄÎTWICE, IN FACT. IF YOU STOPPED YOURSELF, YOU BECOME GOD; THAT‚ÄÔS IT, ISN‚ÄÔT IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, I BECOME GOD.‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH DID NOT EVEN SMILE; HE WAITED. KIRILLOV LOOKED AT HIM SUBTLY.

‚ÄÚYOU ARE A POLITICAL IMPOSTOR AND INTRIGUER. YOU WANT TO LEAD ME ON INTO PHILOSOPHY AND ENTHUSIASM AND TO BRING ABOUT A RECONCILIATION SO AS TO DISPERSE MY ANGER, AND THEN, WHEN I AM RECONCILED WITH YOU, BEG FROM ME A NOTE TO SAY I KILLED SHATOV.‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH ANSWERED WITH ALMOST NATURAL FRANKNESS.

‚ÄÚWELL, SUPPOSING I AM SUCH A SCOUNDREL. BUT AT THE LAST MOMENTS DOES THAT MATTER TO YOU, KIRILLOV? WHAT ARE WE QUARRELLING ABOUT? TELL ME, PLEASE. YOU ARE ONE SORT OF MAN AND I AM ANOTHER‚ÄÎWHAT OF IT? AND WHAT‚ÄÔS MORE, WE ARE BOTH OF US ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSCOUNDRELS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, SCOUNDRELS IF YOU LIKE. BUT YOU KNOW THAT THAT‚ÄÔS ONLY WORDS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚALL MY LIFE I WANTED IT NOT TO BE ONLY WORDS. I LIVED BECAUSE I DID NOT WANT IT TO BE. EVEN NOW EVERY DAY I WANT IT TO BE NOT WORDS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, EVERY ONE SEEKS TO BE WHERE HE IS BEST OFF. THE FISH ‚Ä¶ THAT IS, EVERY ONE SEEKS HIS OWN COMFORT, THAT‚ÄÔS ALL. THAT‚ÄÔS BEEN A COMMONPLACE FOR AGES AND AGES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCOMFORT, DO YOU SAY?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, IT‚ÄÔS NOT WORTH WHILE QUARRELLING OVER WORDS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, YOU WERE RIGHT IN WHAT YOU SAID; LET IT BE COMFORT. GOD IS NECESSARY AND SO MUST EXIST.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, THAT‚ÄÔS ALL RIGHT, THEN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT I KNOW HE DOESN‚ÄÔT AND CAN‚ÄÔT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS MORE LIKELY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSURELY YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT A MAN WITH TWO SUCH IDEAS CAN‚ÄÔT GO ON LIVING?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMUST SHOOT HIMSELF, YOU MEAN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSURELY YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT ONE MIGHT SHOOT ONESELF FOR THAT ALONE? YOU DON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE A MAN, ONE MAN OUT OF YOUR THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS, ONE MAN WHO WON‚ÄÔT BEAR IT AND DOES NOT WANT TO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚALL I UNDERSTAND IS THAT YOU SEEM TO BE HESITATING.‚Ä¶ THAT‚ÄÔS VERY BAD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSTAVROGIN, TOO, IS CONSUMED BY AN IDEA,‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV SAID GLOOMILY, PACING UP AND DOWN THE ROOM. HE HAD NOT NOTICED THE PREVIOUS REMARK.

‚ÄÚWHAT?‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH PRICKED UP HIS EARS. ‚ÄÚWHAT IDEA? DID HE TELL YOU SOMETHING HIMSELF?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, I GUESSED IT MYSELF: IF STAVROGIN HAS FAITH, HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT HE HAS FAITH. IF HE HASN‚ÄÔT FAITH, HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT HE HASN‚ÄÔT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, STAVROGIN HAS GOT SOMETHING ELSE WORSE THAN THAT IN HIS HEAD,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH MUTTERED PEEVISHLY, UNEASILY WATCHING THE TURN THE CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN AND THE PALLOR OF KIRILLOV.

‚ÄÚDAMN IT ALL, HE WON‚ÄÔT SHOOT HIMSELF!‚ÄÙ HE WAS THINKING. ‚ÄÚI ALWAYS SUSPECTED IT; IT‚ÄÔS A MAGGOT IN THE BRAIN AND NOTHING MORE; WHAT A ROTTEN LOT OF PEOPLE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE THE LAST TO BE WITH ME; I SHOULDN‚ÄÔT LIKE TO PART ON BAD TERMS WITH YOU,‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV VOUCHSAFED SUDDENLY.

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH DID NOT ANSWER AT ONCE. ‚ÄÚDAMN IT ALL, WHAT IS IT NOW?‚ÄÙ HE THOUGHT AGAIN.

‚ÄÚI ASSURE YOU, KIRILLOV, I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST YOU PERSONALLY AS A MAN, AND ALWAYS ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE A SCOUNDREL AND A FALSE INTELLECT. BUT I AM JUST THE SAME AS YOU ARE, AND I WILL SHOOT MYSELF WHILE YOU WILL REMAIN LIVING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU MEAN TO SAY, I AM SO ABJECT THAT I WANT TO GO ON LIVING.‚ÄÙ

HE COULD NOT MAKE UP HIS MIND WHETHER IT WAS JUDICIOUS TO KEEP UP SUCH A CONVERSATION AT SUCH A MOMENT OR NOT, AND RESOLVED ‚ÄÚTO BE GUIDED BY CIRCUMSTANCES.‚ÄÙ BUT THE TONE OF SUPERIORITY AND OF CONTEMPT FOR HIM, WHICH KIRILLOV HAD NEVER DISGUISED, HAD ALWAYS IRRITATED HIM, AND NOW FOR SOME REASON IT IRRITATED HIM MORE THAN EVER‚ÄÎPOSSIBLY BECAUSE KIRILLOV, WHO WAS TO DIE WITHIN AN HOUR OR SO (PYOTR STEPANOVITCH STILL RECKONED UPON THIS), SEEMED TO HIM, AS IT WERE, ALREADY ONLY HALF A MAN, SOME CREATURE WHOM HE COULD NOT ALLOW TO BE HAUGHTY.

‚ÄÚYOU SEEM TO BE BOASTING TO ME OF YOUR SHOOTING YOURSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE ALWAYS BEEN SURPRISED AT EVERY ONE‚ÄÔS GOING ON LIVING,‚ÄÙ SAID KIRILLOV, NOT HEARING HIS REMARK.

‚ÄÚH‚ÄÔM! ADMITTING THAT‚ÄÔS AN IDEA, BUT ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU APE, YOU ASSENT TO GET THE BETTER OF ME. HOLD YOUR TONGUE; YOU WON‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING. IF THERE IS NO GOD, THEN I AM GOD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHERE, I COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND THAT POINT OF YOURS: WHY ARE YOU GOD?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF GOD EXISTS, ALL IS HIS WILL AND FROM HIS WILL I CANNOT ESCAPE. IF NOT, IT‚ÄÔS ALL MY WILL AND I AM BOUND TO SHOW SELF-WILL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSELF-WILL? BUT WHY ARE YOU BOUND?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBECAUSE ALL WILL HAS BECOME MINE. CAN IT BE THAT NO ONE IN THE WHOLE PLANET, AFTER MAKING AN END OF GOD AND BELIEVING IN HIS OWN WILL, WILL DARE TO EXPRESS HIS SELF-WILL ON THE MOST VITAL POINT? IT‚ÄÔS LIKE A BEGGAR INHERITING A FORTUNE AND BEING AFRAID OF IT AND NOT DARING TO APPROACH THE BAG OF GOLD, THINKING HIMSELF TOO WEAK TO OWN IT. I WANT TO MANIFEST MY SELF-WILL. I MAY BE THE ONLY ONE, BUT I‚ÄÔLL DO IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDO IT BY ALL MEANS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI AM BOUND TO SHOOT MYSELF BECAUSE THE HIGHEST POINT OF MY SELF-WILL IS TO KILL MYSELF WITH MY OWN HANDS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT YOU WON‚ÄÔT BE THE ONLY ONE TO KILL YOURSELF; THERE ARE LOTS OF SUICIDES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWITH GOOD CAUSE. BUT TO DO IT WITHOUT ANY CAUSE AT ALL, SIMPLY FOR SELF-WILL, I AM THE ONLY ONE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE WON‚ÄÔT SHOOT HIMSELF,‚ÄÙ FLASHED ACROSS PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS MIND AGAIN.

‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW,‚ÄÙ HE OBSERVED IRRITABLY, ‚ÄÚIF I WERE IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD KILL SOMEONE ELSE TO SHOW MY SELF-WILL, NOT MYSELF. YOU MIGHT BE OF USE. I‚ÄÔLL TELL YOU WHOM, IF YOU ARE NOT AFRAID. THEN YOU NEEDN‚ÄÔT SHOOT YOURSELF TO-DAY, PERHAPS. WE MAY COME TO TERMS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO KILL SOMEONE WOULD BE THE LOWEST POINT OF SELF-WILL, AND YOU SHOW YOUR WHOLE SOUL IN THAT. I AM NOT YOU: I WANT THE HIGHEST POINT AND I‚ÄÔLL KILL MYSELF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE‚ÄÔS COME TO IT OF HIMSELF,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH MUTTERED MALIGNANTLY.

‚ÄÚI AM BOUND TO SHOW MY UNBELIEF,‚ÄÙ SAID KIRILLOV, WALKING ABOUT THE ROOM. ‚ÄÚI HAVE NO HIGHER IDEA THAN DISBELIEF IN GOD. I HAVE ALL THE HISTORY OF MANKIND ON MY SIDE. MAN HAS DONE NOTHING BUT INVENT GOD SO AS TO GO ON LIVING, AND NOT KILL HIMSELF; THAT‚ÄÔS THE WHOLE OF UNIVERSAL HISTORY UP TILL NOW. I AM THE FIRST ONE IN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF MANKIND WHO WOULD NOT INVENT GOD. LET THEM KNOW IT ONCE FOR ALL.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE WON‚ÄÔT SHOOT HIMSELF,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH THOUGHT ANXIOUSLY.

‚ÄÚLET WHOM KNOW IT?‚ÄÙ HE SAID, EGGING HIM ON. ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS ONLY YOU AND ME HERE; YOU MEAN LIPUTIN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚLET EVERY ONE KNOW; ALL WILL KNOW. THERE IS NOTHING SECRET THAT WILL NOT BE MADE KNOWN. HE SAID SO.‚ÄÙ

AND HE POINTED WITH FEVERISH ENTHUSIASM TO THE IMAGE OF THE SAVIOUR, BEFORE WHICH A LAMP WAS BURNING. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH LOST HIS TEMPER COMPLETELY.

‚ÄÚSO YOU STILL BELIEVE IN HIM, AND YOU‚ÄÔVE LIGHTED THE LAMP; ‚ÄÒTO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE,‚ÄÔ I SUPPOSE?‚ÄÙ

THE OTHER DID NOT SPEAK.

‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW, TO MY THINKING, YOU BELIEVE PERHAPS MORE THOROUGHLY THAN ANY PRIEST.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBELIEVE IN WHOM? IN HIM? LISTEN.‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV STOOD STILL, GAZING BEFORE HIM WITH FIXED AND ECSTATIC LOOK. ‚ÄÚLISTEN TO A GREAT IDEA: THERE WAS A DAY ON EARTH, AND IN THE MIDST OF THE EARTH THERE STOOD THREE CROSSES. ONE ON THE CROSS HAD SUCH FAITH THAT HE SAID TO ANOTHER, ‚ÄÒTO-DAY THOU SHALT BE WITH ME IN PARADISE.‚ÄÔ THE DAY ENDED; BOTH DIED AND PASSED AWAY AND FOUND NEITHER PARADISE NOR RESURRECTION. HIS WORDS DID NOT COME TRUE. LISTEN: THAT MAN WAS THE LOFTIEST OF ALL ON EARTH, HE WAS THAT WHICH GAVE MEANING TO LIFE. THE WHOLE PLANET, WITH EVERYTHING ON IT, IS MERE MADNESS WITHOUT THAT MAN. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANY LIKE HIM BEFORE OR SINCE, NEVER, UP TO A MIRACLE. FOR THAT IS THE MIRACLE, THAT THERE NEVER WAS OR NEVER WILL BE ANOTHER LIKE HIM. AND IF THAT IS SO, IF THE LAWS OF NATURE DID NOT SPARE EVEN HIM, HAVE NOT SPARED EVEN THEIR MIRACLE AND MADE EVEN HIM LIVE IN A LIE AND DIE FOR A LIE, THEN ALL THE PLANET IS A LIE AND RESTS ON A LIE AND ON MOCKERY. SO THEN, THE VERY LAWS OF THE PLANET ARE A LIE AND THE VAUDEVILLE OF DEVILS. WHAT IS THERE TO LIVE FOR? ANSWER, IF YOU ARE A MAN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS A DIFFERENT MATTER. IT SEEMS TO ME YOU‚ÄÔVE MIXED UP TWO DIFFERENT CAUSES, AND THAT‚ÄÔS A VERY UNSAFE THING TO DO. BUT EXCUSE ME, IF YOU ARE GOD? IF THE LIE WERE ENDED AND IF YOU REALISED THAT ALL THE FALSITY COMES FROM THE BELIEF IN THAT FORMER GOD?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSO AT LAST YOU UNDERSTAND!‚ÄÙ CRIED KIRILLOV RAPTUROUSLY. ‚ÄÚSO IT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD IF EVEN A FELLOW LIKE YOU UNDERSTANDS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND NOW THAT THE SALVATION FOR ALL CONSISTS IN PROVING THIS IDEA TO EVERY ONE? WHO WILL PROVE IT? I! I CAN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND HOW AN ATHEIST COULD KNOW THAT THERE IS NO GOD AND NOT KILL HIMSELF ON THE SPOT. TO RECOGNISE THAT THERE IS NO GOD AND NOT TO RECOGNISE AT THE SAME INSTANT THAT ONE IS GOD ONESELF IS AN ABSURDITY, ELSE ONE WOULD CERTAINLY KILL ONESELF. IF YOU RECOGNISE IT YOU ARE SOVEREIGN, AND THEN YOU WON‚ÄÔT KILL YOURSELF BUT WILL LIVE IN THE GREATEST GLORY. BUT ONE, THE FIRST, MUST KILL HIMSELF, FOR ELSE WHO WILL BEGIN AND PROVE IT? SO I MUST CERTAINLY KILL MYSELF, TO BEGIN AND PROVE IT. NOW I AM ONLY A GOD AGAINST MY WILL AND I AM UNHAPPY, BECAUSE I AM BOUND TO ASSERT MY WILL. ALL ARE UNHAPPY BECAUSE ALL ARE AFRAID TO EXPRESS THEIR WILL. MAN HAS HITHERTO BEEN SO UNHAPPY AND SO POOR BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN AFRAID TO ASSERT HIS WILL IN THE HIGHEST POINT AND HAS SHOWN HIS SELF-WILL ONLY IN LITTLE THINGS, LIKE A SCHOOLBOY. I AM AWFULLY UNHAPPY, FOR I‚ÄÔM AWFULLY AFRAID. TERROR IS THE CURSE OF MAN.‚Ä¶ BUT I WILL ASSERT MY WILL, I AM BOUND TO BELIEVE THAT I DON‚ÄÔT BELIEVE. I WILL BEGIN AND WILL MAKE AN END OF IT AND OPEN THE DOOR, AND WILL SAVE. THAT‚ÄÔS THE ONLY THING THAT WILL SAVE MANKIND AND WILL RE-CREATE THE NEXT GENERATION PHYSICALLY; FOR WITH HIS PRESENT PHYSICAL NATURE MAN CAN‚ÄÔT GET ON WITHOUT HIS FORMER GOD, I BELIEVE. FOR THREE YEARS I‚ÄÔVE BEEN SEEKING FOR THE ATTRIBUTE OF MY GODHEAD AND I‚ÄÔVE FOUND IT; THE ATTRIBUTE OF MY GODHEAD IS SELF-WILL! THAT‚ÄÔS ALL I CAN DO TO PROVE IN THE HIGHEST POINT MY INDEPENDENCE AND MY NEW TERRIBLE FREEDOM. FOR IT IS VERY TERRIBLE. I AM KILLING MYSELF TO PROVE MY INDEPENDENCE AND MY NEW TERRIBLE FREEDOM.‚ÄÙ

HIS FACE WAS UNNATURALLY PALE, AND THERE WAS A TERRIBLY HEAVY LOOK IN HIS EYES. HE WAS LIKE A MAN IN DELIRIUM. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH THOUGHT HE WOULD DROP ON TO THE FLOOR.

‚ÄÚGIVE ME THE PEN!‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV CRIED SUDDENLY, QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY, IN A POSITIVE FRENZY. ‚ÄÚDICTATE; I‚ÄÔLL SIGN ANYTHING. I‚ÄÔLL SIGN THAT I KILLED SHATOV EVEN. DICTATE WHILE IT AMUSES ME. I AM NOT AFRAID OF WHAT THE HAUGHTY SLAVES WILL THINK! YOU WILL SEE FOR YOURSELF THAT ALL THAT IS SECRET SHALL BE MADE MANIFEST! AND YOU WILL BE CRUSHED.‚Ä¶ I BELIEVE, I BELIEVE!‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH JUMPED UP FROM HIS SEAT AND INSTANTLY HANDED HIM AN INKSTAND AND PAPER, AND BEGAN DICTATING, SEIZING THE MOMENT, QUIVERING WITH ANXIETY.

‚ÄÚI, ALEXEY KIRILLOV, DECLARE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSTAY; I WON‚ÄÔT! TO WHOM AM I DECLARING IT?‚ÄÙ

KIRILLOV WAS SHAKING AS THOUGH HE WERE IN A FEVER. THIS DECLARATION AND THE SUDDEN STRANGE IDEA OF IT SEEMED TO ABSORB HIM ENTIRELY, AS THOUGH IT WERE A MEANS OF ESCAPE BY WHICH HIS TORTURED SPIRIT STROVE FOR A MOMENT‚ÄÔS RELIEF.

‚ÄÚTO WHOM AM I DECLARING IT? I WANT TO KNOW TO WHOM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO NO ONE, EVERY ONE, THE FIRST PERSON WHO READS IT. WHY DEFINE IT? THE WHOLE WORLD!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE WHOLE WORLD! BRAVO! AND I WON‚ÄÔT HAVE ANY REPENTANCE. I DON‚ÄÔT WANT PENITENCE AND I DON‚ÄÔT WANT IT FOR THE POLICE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO, OF COURSE, THERE‚ÄÔS NO NEED OF IT, DAMN THE POLICE! WRITE, IF YOU ARE IN EARNEST!‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH CRIED HYSTERICALLY.

‚ÄÚSTAY! I WANT TO PUT AT THE TOP A FACE WITH THE TONGUE OUT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚECH, WHAT NONSENSE,‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH CROSSLY, ‚ÄÚYOU CAN EXPRESS ALL THAT WITHOUT THE DRAWING, BY‚ÄÎTHE TONE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBY THE TONE? THAT‚ÄÔS TRUE. YES, BY THE TONE, BY THE TONE OF IT. DICTATE, THE TONE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI, ALEXEY KIRILLOV,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH DICTATED FIRMLY AND PEREMPTORILY, BENDING OVER KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS SHOULDER AND FOLLOWING EVERY LETTER WHICH THE LATTER FORMED WITH A HAND TREMBLING WITH EXCITEMENT, ‚ÄÚI, KIRILLOV, DECLARE THAT TO-DAY, THE ‚ÄÎTH OCTOBER, AT ABOUT EIGHT O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE EVENING, I KILLED THE STUDENT SHATOV IN THE PARK FOR TURNING TRAITOR AND GIVING INFORMATION OF THE MANIFESTOES AND OF FEDKA, WHO HAS BEEN LODGING WITH US FOR TEN DAYS IN FILIPOV‚ÄÔS HOUSE. I AM SHOOTING MYSELF TO-DAY WITH MY REVOLVER, NOT BECAUSE I REPENT AND AM AFRAID OF YOU, BUT BECAUSE WHEN I WAS ABROAD I MADE UP MY MIND TO PUT AN END TO MY LIFE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIS THAT ALL?‚ÄÙ CRIED KIRILLOV WITH SURPRISE AND INDIGNATION.

‚ÄÚNOT ANOTHER WORD,‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WAVING HIS HAND, ATTEMPTING TO SNATCH THE DOCUMENT FROM HIM.

‚ÄÚSTAY.‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV PUT HIS HAND FIRMLY ON THE PAPER. ‚ÄÚSTAY, IT‚ÄÔS NONSENSE! I WANT TO SAY WITH WHOM I KILLED HIM. WHY FEDKA? AND WHAT ABOUT THE FIRE? I WANT IT ALL AND I WANT TO BE ABUSIVE IN TONE, TOO, IN TONE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚENOUGH, KIRILLOV, I ASSURE YOU IT‚ÄÔS ENOUGH,‚ÄÙ CRIED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH ALMOST IMPLORINGLY, TREMBLING LEST HE SHOULD TEAR UP THE PAPER; ‚ÄÚTHAT THEY MAY BELIEVE YOU, YOU MUST SAY IT AS OBSCURELY AS POSSIBLE, JUST LIKE THAT, SIMPLY IN HINTS. YOU MUST ONLY GIVE THEM A PEEP OF THE TRUTH, JUST ENOUGH TO TANTALISE THEM. THEY‚ÄÔLL TELL A STORY BETTER THAN OURS, AND OF COURSE THEY‚ÄÔLL BELIEVE THEMSELVES MORE THAN THEY WOULD US; AND YOU KNOW, IT‚ÄÔS BETTER THAN ANYTHING‚ÄÎBETTER THAN ANYTHING! LET ME HAVE IT, IT‚ÄÔS SPLENDID AS IT IS; GIVE IT TO ME, GIVE IT TO ME!‚ÄÙ

AND HE KEPT TRYING TO SNATCH THE PAPER. KIRILLOV LISTENED OPEN-EYED AND APPEARED TO BE TRYING TO REFLECT, BUT HE SEEMED BEYOND UNDERSTANDING NOW.

‚ÄÚDAMN IT ALL,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH CRIED ALL AT ONCE, ILL-HUMOUREDLY, ‚ÄÚHE HASN‚ÄÔT SIGNED IT! WHY ARE YOU STARING LIKE THAT? SIGN!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WANT TO ABUSE THEM,‚ÄÙ MUTTERED KIRILLOV. HE TOOK THE PEN, HOWEVER, AND SIGNED. ‚ÄÚI WANT TO ABUSE THEM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWRITE ‚ÄÒVIVE LA R√©PUBLIQUE,‚ÄÔ AND THAT WILL BE ENOUGH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBRAVO!‚ÄÙ KIRILLOV ALMOST BELLOWED WITH DELIGHT. ‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒVIVE LA R√©PUBLIQUE D√©MOCRATIQUE SOCIALE ET UNIVERSELLE OU LA MORT!‚ÄÔ NO, NO, THAT‚ÄÔS NOT IT. ‚ÄÒLIBERT√©, √©GALIT√©, FRATERNIT√© OU LA MORT.‚ÄÔ THERE, THAT‚ÄÔS BETTER, THAT‚ÄÔS BETTER.‚ÄÙ HE WROTE IT GLEEFULLY UNDER HIS SIGNATURE.

‚ÄÚENOUGH, ENOUGH,‚ÄÙ REPEATED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH.

‚ÄÚSTAY, A LITTLE MORE. I‚ÄÔLL SIGN IT AGAIN IN FRENCH, YOU KNOW. ‚ÄÒDE KIRILLOV, GENTILHOMME RUSSE ET CITOYEN DU MONDE.‚ÄÔ HA HA!‚ÄÙ HE WENT OFF IN A PEAL OF LAUGHTER. ‚ÄÚNO, NO, NO; STAY. I‚ÄÔVE FOUND SOMETHING BETTER THAN ALL. EUREKA! ‚ÄÒGENTILHOMME, S√©MINARISTE RUSSE ET CITOYEN DU MONDE CIVILIS√©!‚ÄÔ THAT‚ÄÔS BETTER THAN ANY.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HE JUMPED UP FROM THE SOFA AND SUDDENLY, WITH A RAPID GESTURE, SNATCHED UP THE REVOLVER FROM THE WINDOW, RAN WITH IT INTO THE NEXT ROOM, AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM.

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH STOOD FOR A MOMENT, PONDERING AND GAZING AT THE DOOR.

‚ÄÚIF HE DOES IT AT ONCE, PERHAPS HE‚ÄÔLL DO IT, BUT IF HE BEGINS THINKING, NOTHING WILL COME OF IT.‚ÄÙ

MEANWHILE HE TOOK UP THE PAPER, SAT DOWN, AND LOOKED AT IT AGAIN. THE WORDING OF THE DOCUMENT PLEASED HIM AGAIN.

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS NEEDED FOR THE MOMENT? WHAT‚ÄÔS WANTED IS TO THROW THEM ALL OFF THE SCENT AND KEEP THEM BUSY FOR A TIME. THE PARK? THERE‚ÄÔS NO PARK IN THE TOWN AND THEY‚ÄÔLL GUESS ITS SKVORESHNIKI OF THEMSELVES. BUT WHILE THEY ARE ARRIVING AT THAT, TIME WILL BE PASSING; THEN THE SEARCH WILL TAKE TIME TOO; THEN WHEN THEY FIND THE BODY IT WILL PROVE THAT THE STORY IS TRUE, AND IT WILL FOLLOW THAT‚ÄÔS IT ALL TRUE, THAT IT‚ÄÔS TRUE ABOUT FEDKA TOO. AND FEDKA EXPLAINS THE FIRE, THE LEBYADKINS; SO THAT IT WAS ALL BEING HATCHED HERE, AT FILIPOV‚ÄÔS, WHILE THEY OVERLOOKED IT AND SAW NOTHING‚ÄÎTHAT WILL QUITE TURN THEIR HEADS! THEY WILL NEVER THINK OF THE QUINTET; SHATOV AND KIRILLOV AND FEDKA AND LEBYADKIN, AND WHY THEY KILLED EACH OTHER‚ÄÎTHAT WILL BE ANOTHER QUESTION FOR THEM. OH, DAMN IT ALL, I DON‚ÄÔT HEAR THE SHOT!‚ÄÙ

THOUGH HE HAD BEEN READING AND ADMIRING THE WORDING OF IT, HE HAD BEEN LISTENING ANXIOUSLY ALL THE TIME, AND HE SUDDENLY FLEW INTO A RAGE. HE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT HIS WATCH; IT WAS GETTING LATE AND IT WAS FULLY TEN MINUTES SINCE KIRILLOV HAD GONE OUT.‚Ä¶ SNATCHING UP THE CANDLE, HE WENT TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM WHERE KIRILLOV HAD SHUT HIMSELF UP. HE WAS JUST AT THE DOOR WHEN THE THOUGHT STRUCK HIM THAT THE CANDLE HAD BURNT OUT, THAT IT WOULD NOT LAST ANOTHER TWENTY MINUTES, AND THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER IN THE ROOM. HE TOOK HOLD OF THE HANDLE AND LISTENED WARILY; HE DID NOT HEAR THE SLIGHTEST SOUND. HE SUDDENLY OPENED THE DOOR AND LIFTED UP THE CANDLE: SOMETHING UTTERED A ROAR AND RUSHED AT HIM. HE SLAMMED THE DOOR WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND PRESSED HIS WEIGHT AGAINST IT; BUT ALL SOUNDS DIED AWAY AND AGAIN THERE WAS DEATHLIKE STILLNESS.

HE STOOD FOR A LONG WHILE IRRESOLUTE, WITH THE CANDLE IN HIS HAND. HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO SEE VERY LITTLE IN THE SECOND HE HELD THE DOOR OPEN, BUT HE HAD CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE FACE OF KIRILLOV STANDING AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM BY THE WINDOW, AND THE SAVAGE FURY WITH WHICH THE LATTER HAD RUSHED UPON HIM. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH STARTED, RAPIDLY SET THE CANDLE ON THE TABLE, MADE READY HIS REVOLVER, AND RETREATED ON TIPTOE TO THE FARTHEST CORNER OF THE ROOM, SO THAT IF KIRILLOV OPENED THE DOOR AND RUSHED UP TO THE TABLE WITH THE REVOLVER HE WOULD STILL HAVE TIME TO BE THE FIRST TO AIM AND FIRE.

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD BY NOW LOST ALL FAITH IN THE SUICIDE. ‚ÄÚHE WAS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM, THINKING,‚ÄÙ FLASHED LIKE A WHIRLWIND THROUGH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS MIND, ‚ÄÚAND THE ROOM WAS DARK AND HORRIBLE TOO.‚Ä¶ HE ROARED AND RUSHED AT ME. THERE ARE TWO POSSIBILITIES: EITHER I INTERRUPTED HIM AT THE VERY SECOND WHEN HE WAS PULLING THE TRIGGER OR ‚Ä¶ OR HE WAS STANDING PLANNING HOW TO KILL ME. YES, THAT‚ÄÔS IT, HE WAS PLANNING IT.‚Ä¶ HE KNOWS I WON‚ÄÔT GO AWAY WITHOUT KILLING HIM IF HE FUNKS IT HIMSELF‚ÄÎSO THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO KILL ME FIRST TO PREVENT MY KILLING HIM.‚Ä¶ AND AGAIN, AGAIN THERE IS SILENCE. I AM REALLY FRIGHTENED: HE MAY OPEN THE DOOR ALL OF A SUDDEN.‚Ä¶ THE NUISANCE OF IT IS THAT HE BELIEVES IN GOD LIKE ANY PRIEST.‚Ä¶ HE WON‚ÄÔT SHOOT HIMSELF FOR ANYTHING! THERE ARE LOTS OF THESE PEOPLE NOWADAYS ‚ÄÒWHO‚ÄÔVE COME TO IT OF THEMSELVES.‚ÄÔ A ROTTEN LOT! OH, DAMN IT, THE CANDLE, THE CANDLE! IT‚ÄÔLL GO OUT WITHIN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR FOR CERTAIN.‚Ä¶ I MUST PUT A STOP TO IT; COME WHAT MAY, I MUST PUT A STOP TO IT.‚Ä¶ NOW I CAN KILL HIM.‚Ä¶ WITH THAT DOCUMENT HERE NO ONE WOULD THINK OF MY KILLING HIM. I CAN PUT HIM IN SUCH AN ATTITUDE ON THE FLOOR WITH AN UNLOADED REVOLVER IN HIS HAND THAT THEY‚ÄÔD BE CERTAIN HE‚ÄÔD DONE IT HIMSELF.‚Ä¶ ACH, DAMN IT! HOW IS ONE TO KILL HIM? IF I OPEN THE DOOR HE‚ÄÔLL RUSH OUT AGAIN AND SHOOT ME FIRST. DAMN IT ALL, HE‚ÄÔLL BE SURE TO MISS!‚ÄÙ

HE WAS IN AGONIES, TREMBLING AT THE NECESSITY OF ACTION AND HIS OWN INDECISION. AT LAST HE TOOK UP THE CANDLE AND AGAIN APPROACHED THE DOOR WITH THE REVOLVER HELD UP IN READINESS; HE PUT HIS LEFT HAND, IN WHICH HE HELD THE CANDLE, ON THE DOORHANDLE. BUT HE MANAGED AWKWARDLY: THE HANDLE CLANKED, THERE WAS A RATTLE AND A CREAK. ‚ÄÚHE WILL FIRE STRAIGHTWAY,‚ÄÙ FLASHED THROUGH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS MIND. WITH HIS FOOT HE FLUNG THE DOOR OPEN VIOLENTLY, RAISED THE CANDLE, AND HELD OUT THE REVOLVER; BUT NO SHOT NOR CRY CAME FROM WITHIN.‚Ä¶ THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE ROOM.

HE STARTED. THE ROOM LED NOWHERE. THERE WAS NO EXIT, NO MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM IT. HE LIFTED THE CANDLE HIGHER AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM MORE ATTENTIVELY: THERE WAS CERTAINLY NO ONE. HE CALLED KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS NAME IN A LOW VOICE, THEN AGAIN LOUDER; NO ONE ANSWERED.

‚ÄÚCAN HE HAVE GOT OUT BY THE WINDOW?‚ÄÙ THE CASEMENT IN ONE WINDOW WAS, IN FACT, OPEN. ‚ÄÚABSURD! HE COULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE GOT AWAY THROUGH THE CASEMENT.‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH CROSSED THE ROOM AND WENT UP TO THE WINDOW. ‚ÄÚHE COULDN‚ÄÔT POSSIBLY.‚ÄÙ ALL AT ONCE HE TURNED ROUND QUICKLY AND WAS AGHAST AT SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY.

AGAINST THE WALL FACING THE WINDOWS ON THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR STOOD A CUPBOARD. ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THIS CUPBOARD, IN THE CORNER FORMED BY THE CUPBOARD AND THE WALL, STOOD KIRILLOV, AND HE WAS STANDING IN A VERY STRANGE WAY; MOTIONLESS, PERFECTLY ERECT, WITH HIS ARMS HELD STIFFLY AT HIS SIDES, HIS HEAD RAISED AND PRESSED TIGHTLY BACK AGAINST THE WALL IN THE VERY CORNER, HE SEEMED TO BE TRYING TO CONCEAL AND EFFACE HIMSELF. EVERYTHING SEEMED TO SHOW THAT HE WAS HIDING, YET SOMEHOW IT WAS NOT EASY TO BELIEVE IT. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS STANDING A LITTLE SIDEWAYS TO THE CORNER, AND COULD ONLY SEE THE PROJECTING PARTS OF THE FIGURE. HE COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO MOVE TO THE LEFT TO GET A FULL VIEW OF KIRILLOV AND SOLVE THE MYSTERY. HIS HEART BEGAN BEATING VIOLENTLY, AND HE FELT A SUDDEN RUSH OF BLIND FURY: HE STARTED FROM WHERE HE STOOD, AND, SHOUTING AND STAMPING WITH HIS FEET, HE RUSHED TO THE HORRIBLE PLACE.

BUT WHEN HE REACHED KIRILLOV HE STOPPED SHORT AGAIN, STILL MORE OVERCOME, HORROR-STRICKEN. WHAT STRUCK HIM MOST WAS THAT, IN SPITE OF HIS SHOUT AND HIS FURIOUS RUSH, THE FIGURE DID NOT STIR, DID NOT MOVE IN A SINGLE LIMB‚ÄÎAS THOUGH IT WERE OF STONE OR OF WAX. THE PALLOR OF THE FACE WAS UNNATURAL, THE BLACK EYES WERE QUITE UNMOVING AND WERE STARING AWAY AT A POINT IN THE DISTANCE. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH LOWERED THE CANDLE AND RAISED IT AGAIN, LIGHTING UP THE FIGURE FROM ALL POINTS OF VIEW AND SCRUTINISING IT. HE SUDDENLY NOTICED THAT, ALTHOUGH KIRILLOV WAS LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM, HE COULD SEE HIM AND WAS PERHAPS WATCHING HIM OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE. THEN THE IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM TO HOLD THE CANDLE RIGHT UP TO THE WRETCH‚ÄÔS FACE, TO SCORCH HIM AND SEE WHAT HE WOULD DO. HE SUDDENLY FANCIED THAT KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS CHIN TWITCHED AND THAT SOMETHING LIKE A MOCKING SMILE PASSED OVER HIS LIPS‚ÄÎAS THOUGH HE HAD GUESSED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS THOUGHT. HE SHUDDERED AND, BESIDE HIMSELF, CLUTCHED VIOLENTLY AT KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS SHOULDER.

THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED SO HIDEOUS AND SO SOON OVER THAT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH COULD NEVER AFTERWARDS RECOVER A COHERENT IMPRESSION OF IT. HE HAD HARDLY TOUCHED KIRILLOV WHEN THE LATTER BENT DOWN QUICKLY AND WITH HIS HEAD KNOCKED THE CANDLE OUT OF PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS HAND; THE CANDLESTICK FELL WITH A CLANG ON THE GROUND AND THE CANDLE WENT OUT. AT THE SAME MOMENT HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A FEARFUL PAIN IN THE LITTLE FINGER OF HIS LEFT HAND. HE CRIED OUT, AND ALL THAT HE COULD REMEMBER WAS THAT, BESIDE HIMSELF, HE HIT OUT WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND STRUCK THREE BLOWS WITH THE REVOLVER ON THE HEAD OF KIRILLOV, WHO HAD BENT DOWN TO HIM AND HAD BITTEN HIS FINGER. AT LAST HE TORE AWAY HIS FINGER AND RUSHED HEADLONG TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE, FEELING HIS WAY IN THE DARK. HE WAS PURSUED BY TERRIBLE SHOUTS FROM THE ROOM.

‚ÄÚDIRECTLY, DIRECTLY, DIRECTLY, DIRECTLY.‚ÄÙ TEN TIMES. BUT HE STILL RAN ON, AND WAS RUNNING INTO THE PORCH WHEN HE SUDDENLY HEARD A LOUD SHOT. THEN HE STOPPED SHORT IN THE DARK PORCH AND STOOD DELIBERATING FOR FIVE MINUTES; AT LAST HE MADE HIS WAY BACK INTO THE HOUSE. BUT HE HAD TO GET THE CANDLE. HE HAD ONLY TO FEEL ON THE FLOOR ON THE RIGHT OF THE CUPBOARD FOR THE CANDLESTICK; BUT HOW WAS HE TO LIGHT THE CANDLE? THERE SUDDENLY CAME INTO HIS MIND A VAGUE RECOLLECTION: HE RECALLED THAT WHEN HE HAD RUN INTO THE KITCHEN THE DAY BEFORE TO ATTACK FEDKA HE HAD NOTICED IN PASSING A LARGE RED BOX OF MATCHES IN A CORNER ON A SHELF. FEELING WITH HIS HANDS, HE MADE HIS WAY TO THE DOOR ON THE LEFT LEADING TO THE KITCHEN, FOUND IT, CROSSED THE PASSAGE, AND WENT DOWN THE STEPS. ON THE SHELF, ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE HE HAD JUST RECALLED SEEING IT, HE FELT IN THE DARK A FULL UNOPENED BOX OF MATCHES. HE HURRIEDLY WENT UP THE STEPS AGAIN WITHOUT STRIKING A LIGHT, AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN HE WAS NEAR THE CUPBOARD, AT THE SPOT WHERE HE HAD STRUCK KIRILLOV WITH THE REVOLVER AND BEEN BITTEN BY HIM, THAT HE REMEMBERED HIS BITTEN FINGER, AND AT THE SAME INSTANT WAS CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS UNBEARABLY PAINFUL. CLENCHING HIS TEETH, HE MANAGED SOMEHOW TO LIGHT THE CANDLE-END, SET IT IN THE CANDLESTICK AGAIN, AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM: NEAR THE OPEN CASEMENT, WITH HIS FEET TOWARDS THE RIGHT-HAND CORNER, LAY THE DEAD BODY OF KIRILLOV. THE SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED AT THE RIGHT TEMPLE AND THE BULLET HAD COME OUT AT THE TOP ON THE LEFT, SHATTERING THE SKULL. THERE WERE SPLASHES OF BLOOD AND BRAINS. THE REVOLVER WAS STILL IN THE SUICIDE‚ÄÔS HAND ON THE FLOOR. DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN INSTANTANEOUS. AFTER A CAREFUL LOOK ROUND, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH GOT UP AND WENT OUT ON TIPTOE, CLOSED THE DOOR, LEFT THE CANDLE ON THE TABLE IN THE OUTER ROOM, THOUGHT A MOMENT, AND RESOLVED NOT TO PUT IT OUT, REFLECTING THAT IT COULD NOT POSSIBLY SET FIRE TO ANYTHING. LOOKING ONCE MORE AT THE DOCUMENT LEFT ON THE TABLE, HE SMILED MECHANICALLY AND THEN WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE, STILL FOR SOME REASON WALKING ON TIPTOE. HE CREPT THROUGH FEDKA‚ÄÔS HOLE AGAIN AND CAREFULLY REPLACED THE POSTS AFTER HIM.

III

PRECISELY AT TEN MINUTES TO SIX PYOTR STEPANOVITCH AND ERKEL WERE WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM AT THE RAILWAY-STATION BESIDE A RATHER LONG TRAIN. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS SETTING OFF AND ERKEL WAS SAYING GOOD-BYE TO HIM. THE LUGGAGE WAS IN, AND HIS BAG WAS IN THE SEAT HE HAD TAKEN IN A SECOND-CLASS CARRIAGE. THE FIRST BELL HAD RUNG ALREADY; THEY WERE WAITING FOR THE SECOND. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH LOOKED ABOUT HIM, OPENLY WATCHING THE PASSENGERS AS THEY GOT INTO THE TRAIN. BUT HE DID NOT MEET ANYONE HE KNEW WELL; ONLY TWICE HE NODDED TO ACQUAINTANCES‚ÄÎA MERCHANT WHOM HE KNEW SLIGHTLY, AND THEN A YOUNG VILLAGE PRIEST WHO WAS GOING TO HIS PARISH TWO STATIONS AWAY. ERKEL EVIDENTLY WANTED TO SPEAK OF SOMETHING OF IMPORTANCE IN THE LAST MOMENTS, THOUGH POSSIBLY HE DID NOT HIMSELF KNOW EXACTLY OF WHAT, BUT HE COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO BEGIN! HE KEPT FANCYING THAT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH SEEMED ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF HIM AND WAS IMPATIENT FOR THE LAST BELL.

‚ÄÚYOU LOOK AT EVERY ONE SO OPENLY,‚ÄÙ HE OBSERVED WITH SOME TIMIDITY, AS THOUGH HE WOULD HAVE WARNED HIM.

‚ÄÚWHY NOT? IT WOULD NOT DO FOR ME TO CONCEAL MYSELF AT PRESENT. IT‚ÄÔS TOO SOON. DON‚ÄÔT BE UNEASY. ALL I AM AFRAID OF IS THAT THE DEVIL MIGHT SEND LIPUTIN THIS WAY; HE MIGHT SCENT ME OUT AND RACE OFF HERE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPYOTR STEPANOVITCH, THEY ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED,‚ÄÙ ERKEL BROUGHT OUT RESOLUTELY.

‚ÄÚLIPUTIN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNONE OF THEM, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNONSENSE! THEY ARE ALL BOUND BY WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY. THERE ISN‚ÄÔT ONE WHO WOULD TURN TRAITOR. PEOPLE WON‚ÄÔT GO TO CERTAIN DESTRUCTION UNLESS THEY‚ÄÔVE LOST THEIR REASON.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPYOTR STEPANOVITCH, BUT THEY WILL LOSE THEIR REASON.‚ÄÙ EVIDENTLY THAT IDEA HAD ALREADY OCCURRED TO PYOTR STEPANOVITCH TOO, AND SO ERKEL‚ÄÔS OBSERVATION IRRITATED HIM THE MORE.

‚ÄÚYOU ARE NOT IN A FUNK TOO, ARE YOU, ERKEL? I RELY ON YOU MORE THAN ON ANY OF THEM. I‚ÄÔVE SEEN NOW WHAT EACH OF THEM IS WORTH. TELL THEM TO-DAY ALL I‚ÄÔVE TOLD YOU. I LEAVE THEM IN YOUR CHARGE. GO ROUND TO EACH OF THEM THIS MORNING. READ THEM MY WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS TO-MORROW, OR THE DAY AFTER, WHEN YOU ARE ALL TOGETHER AND THEY ARE CAPABLE OF LISTENING AGAIN ‚Ä¶ AND BELIEVE ME, THEY WILL BE BY TO-MORROW, FOR THEY‚ÄÔLL BE IN AN AWFUL FUNK, AND THAT WILL MAKE THEM AS SOFT AS WAX.‚Ä¶ THE GREAT THING IS THAT YOU SHOULDN‚ÄÔT BE DOWNHEARTED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚACH, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, IT WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU WEREN‚ÄÔT GOING AWAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT I AM ONLY GOING FOR A FEW DAYS; I SHALL BE BACK IN NO TIME.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPYOTR STEPANOVITCH,‚ÄÙ ERKEL BROUGHT OUT WARILY BUT RESOLUTELY, ‚ÄÚWHAT IF YOU WERE GOING TO PETERSBURG? OF COURSE, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE ONLY DOING WHAT‚ÄÔS NECESSARY FOR THE CAUSE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI EXPECTED AS MUCH FROM YOU, ERKEL. IF YOU HAVE GUESSED THAT I AM GOING TO PETERSBURG YOU CAN REALISE THAT I COULDN‚ÄÔT TELL THEM YESTERDAY, AT THAT MOMENT, THAT I WAS GOING SO FAR FOR FEAR OF FRIGHTENING THEM. YOU SAW FOR YOURSELF WHAT A STATE THEY WERE IN. BUT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I AM GOING FOR THE CAUSE, FOR WORK OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE, FOR THE COMMON CAUSE, AND NOT TO SAVE MY SKIN, AS LIPUTIN IMAGINES.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚPYOTR STEPANOVITCH, WHAT IF YOU WERE GOING ABROAD? I SHOULD UNDERSTAND ‚Ä¶ I SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MUST BE CAREFUL OF YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU ARE EVERYTHING AND WE ARE NOTHING. I SHALL UNDERSTAND, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH.‚ÄÙ THE POOR BOY‚ÄÔS VOICE ACTUALLY QUIVERED.

‚ÄÚTHANK YOU, ERKEL.‚Ä¶ AIE, YOU‚ÄÔVE TOUCHED MY BAD FINGER.‚ÄÙ (ERKEL HAD PRESSED HIS HAND AWKWARDLY; THE BAD FINGER WAS DISCREETLY BOUND UP IN BLACK SILK.) ‚ÄÚBUT I TELL YOU POSITIVELY AGAIN THAT I AM GOING TO PETERSBURG ONLY TO SNIFF ROUND, AND PERHAPS SHALL ONLY BE THERE FOR TWENTY-FOUR HOURS AND THEN BACK HERE AGAIN AT ONCE. WHEN I COME BACK I SHALL STAY AT GAGANOV‚ÄÔS COUNTRY PLACE FOR THE SAKE OF APPEARANCES. IF THERE IS ANY NOTION OF DANGER, I SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO TAKE THE LEAD AND SHARE IT. IF I STAY LONGER IN PETERSBURG I‚ÄÔLL LET YOU KNOW AT ONCE ‚Ä¶ IN THE WAY WE‚ÄÔVE ARRANGED, AND YOU‚ÄÔLL TELL THEM.‚ÄÙ THE SECOND BELL RANG.

‚ÄÚAH, THEN THERE‚ÄÔS ONLY FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE TRAIN STARTS. I DON‚ÄÔT WANT THE GROUP HERE TO BREAK UP, YOU KNOW. I AM NOT AFRAID; DON‚ÄÔT BE ANXIOUS ABOUT ME. I HAVE PLENTY OF SUCH CENTRES, AND IT‚ÄÔS NOT MUCH CONSEQUENCE; BUT THERE‚ÄÔS NO HARM IN HAVING AS MANY CENTRES AS POSSIBLE. BUT I AM QUITE AT EASE ABOUT YOU, THOUGH I AM LEAVING YOU ALMOST ALONE WITH THOSE IDIOTS. DON‚ÄÔT BE UNEASY; THEY WON‚ÄÔT TURN TRAITOR, THEY WON‚ÄÔT HAVE THE PLUCK.‚Ä¶ HA HA, YOU GOING TO-DAY TOO?‚ÄÙ HE CRIED SUDDENLY IN A QUITE DIFFERENT, CHEERFUL VOICE TO A VERY YOUNG MAN, WHO CAME UP GAILY TO GREET HIM. ‚ÄÚI DIDN‚ÄÔT KNOW YOU WERE GOING BY THE EXPRESS TOO. WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO ‚Ä¶ YOUR MOTHER‚ÄÔS?‚ÄÙ

THE MOTHER OF THE YOUNG MAN WAS A VERY WEALTHY LANDOWNER IN A NEIGHBOURING PROVINCE, AND THE YOUNG MAN WAS A DISTANT RELATION OF YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS AND HAD BEEN STAYING ABOUT A FORTNIGHT IN OUR TOWN.

‚ÄÚNO, I AM GOING FARTHER, TO R‚ÄÎ‚ÄÎ. I‚ÄÔVE EIGHT HOURS TO LIVE THROUGH IN THE TRAIN. OFF TO PETERSBURG?‚ÄÙ LAUGHED THE YOUNG MAN.

‚ÄÚWHAT MAKES YOU SUPPOSE I MUST BE GOING TO PETERSBURG?‚ÄÙ SAID PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, LAUGHING EVEN MORE OPENLY.

THE YOUNG MAN SHOOK HIS GLOVED FINGER AT HIM.

‚ÄÚWELL, YOU‚ÄÔVE GUESSED RIGHT,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WHISPERED TO HIM MYSTERIOUSLY. ‚ÄÚI AM GOING WITH LETTERS FROM YULIA MIHAILOVNA AND HAVE TO CALL ON THREE OR FOUR PERSONAGES, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE‚ÄÎBOTHER THEM ALL, TO SPEAK CANDIDLY. IT‚ÄÔS A BEASTLY JOB!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT WHY IS SHE IN SUCH A PANIC? TELL ME,‚ÄÙ THE YOUNG MAN WHISPERED TOO. ‚ÄÚSHE WOULDN‚ÄÔT SEE EVEN ME YESTERDAY. I DON‚ÄÔT THINK SHE HAS ANYTHING TO FEAR FOR HER HUSBAND, QUITE THE CONTRARY; HE FELL DOWN SO CREDITABLY AT THE FIRE‚ÄÎREADY TO SACRIFICE HIS LIFE, SO TO SPEAK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, THERE IT IS,‚ÄÙ LAUGHED PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. ‚ÄÚYOU SEE, SHE IS AFRAID THAT PEOPLE MAY HAVE WRITTEN FROM HERE ALREADY ‚Ä¶ THAT IS, SOME GENTLEMEN.‚Ä¶ THE FACT IS, STAVROGIN IS AT THE BOTTOM OF IT, OR RATHER PRINCE K.‚Ä¶ ECH, IT‚ÄÔS A LONG STORY; I‚ÄÔLL TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT IT ON THE JOURNEY IF YOU LIKE‚ÄÎAS FAR AS MY CHIVALROUS FEELINGS WILL ALLOW ME, AT LEAST.‚Ä¶ THIS IS MY RELATION, LIEUTENANT ERKEL, WHO LIVES DOWN HERE.‚ÄÙ

THE YOUNG MAN, WHO HAD BEEN STEALTHILY GLANCING AT ERKEL, TOUCHED HIS HAT; ERKEL MADE A BOW.

‚ÄÚBUT I SAY, VERHOVENSKY, EIGHT HOURS IN THE TRAIN IS AN AWFUL ORDEAL. BERESTOV, THE COLONEL, AN AWFULLY FUNNY FELLOW, IS TRAVELLING WITH ME IN THE FIRST CLASS. HE IS A NEIGHBOUR OF OURS IN THE COUNTRY, AND HIS WIFE IS A GARIN (N√©E DE GARINE), AND YOU KNOW HE IS A VERY DECENT FELLOW. HE‚ÄÔS GOT IDEAS TOO. HE‚ÄÔS ONLY BEEN HERE A COUPLE OF DAYS. HE‚ÄÔS PASSIONATELY FOND OF WHIST; COULDN‚ÄÔT WE GET UP A GAME, EH? I‚ÄÔVE ALREADY FIXED ON A FOURTH‚ÄÎPRIPUHLOV, OUR MERCHANT FROM T‚ÄÎ‚ÄÎWITH A BEARD, A MILLIONAIRE‚ÄÎI MEAN IT, A REAL MILLIONAIRE; YOU CAN TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔLL INTRODUCE YOU; HE IS A VERY INTERESTING MONEY-BAG. WE SHALL HAVE A LAUGH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI SHALL BE DELIGHTED, AND I AM AWFULLY FOND OF CARDS IN THE TRAIN, BUT I AM GOING SECOND CLASS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNONSENSE, THAT‚ÄÔS NO MATTER. GET IN WITH US. I‚ÄÔLL TELL THEM DIRECTLY TO MOVE YOU TO THE FIRST CLASS. THE CHIEF GUARD WOULD DO ANYTHING I TELL HIM. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?‚Ä¶ A BAG? A RUG?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFIRST-RATE. COME ALONG!‚ÄÙ

PYOTR STEPANOVITCH TOOK HIS BAG, HIS RUG, AND HIS BOOK, AND AT ONCE AND WITH ALACRITY TRANSFERRED HIMSELF TO THE FIRST CLASS. ERKEL HELPED HIM. THE THIRD BELL RANG.

‚ÄÚWELL, ERKEL.‚ÄÙ HURRIEDLY, AND WITH A PREOCCUPIED AIR, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HELD OUT HIS HAND FROM THE WINDOW FOR THE LAST TIME. ‚ÄÚYOU SEE, I AM SITTING DOWN TO CARDS WITH THEM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY EXPLAIN, PYOTR STEPANOVITCH? I UNDERSTAND, I UNDERSTAND IT ALL!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, AU REVOIR,‚ÄÙ PYOTR STEPANOVITCH TURNED AWAY SUDDENLY ON HIS NAME BEING CALLED BY THE YOUNG MAN, WHO WANTED TO INTRODUCE HIM TO HIS PARTNERS. AND ERKEL SAW NOTHING MORE OF PYOTR STEPANOVITCH.

HE RETURNED HOME VERY SAD. NOT THAT HE WAS ALARMED AT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS LEAVING THEM SO SUDDENLY, BUT ‚Ä¶ HE HAD TURNED AWAY FROM HIM SO QUICKLY WHEN THAT YOUNG SWELL HAD CALLED TO HIM AND ‚Ä¶ HE MIGHT HAVE SAID SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO HIM, NOT ‚ÄÚAU REVOIR,‚ÄÙ OR ‚Ä¶ OR AT LEAST HAVE PRESSED HIS HAND MORE WARMLY. THAT LAST WAS BITTEREST OF ALL. SOMETHING ELSE WAS BEGINNING TO GNAW IN HIS POOR LITTLE HEART, SOMETHING WHICH HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIMSELF YET, SOMETHING CONNECTED WITH THE EVENING BEFORE.





CHAPTER VII. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS LAST WANDERING

I

I AM PERSUADED THAT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED AS HE FELT THE TIME FIXED FOR HIS INSANE ENTERPRISE DRAWING NEAR. I AM CONVINCED THAT HE SUFFERED DREADFULLY FROM TERROR, ESPECIALLY ON THE NIGHT BEFORE HE STARTED‚ÄÎTHAT AWFUL NIGHT. NASTASYA MENTIONED AFTERWARDS THAT HE HAD GONE TO BED LATE AND FALLEN ASLEEP. BUT THAT PROVES NOTHING; MEN SENTENCED TO DEATH SLEEP VERY SOUNDLY, THEY SAY, EVEN THE NIGHT BEFORE THEIR EXECUTION. THOUGH HE SET OFF BY DAYLIGHT, WHEN A NERVOUS MAN IS ALWAYS A LITTLE MORE CONFIDENT (AND THE MAJOR, VIRGINSKY‚ÄÔS RELATIVE, USED TO GIVE UP BELIEVING IN GOD EVERY MORNING WHEN THE NIGHT WAS OVER), YET I AM CONVINCED HE COULD NEVER, WITHOUT HORROR, HAVE IMAGINED HIMSELF ALONE ON THE HIGH ROAD IN SUCH A POSITION. NO DOUBT A CERTAIN DESPERATION IN HIS FEELINGS SOFTENED AT FIRST THE TERRIBLE SENSATION OF SUDDEN SOLITUDE IN WHICH HE AT ONCE FOUND HIMSELF AS SOON AS HE HAD LEFT NASTASYA, AND THE CORNER IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN WARM AND SNUG FOR TWENTY YEARS. BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE; EVEN WITH THE CLEAREST RECOGNITION OF ALL THE HORRORS AWAITING HIM HE WOULD HAVE GONE OUT TO THE HIGH ROAD AND WALKED ALONG IT! THERE WAS SOMETHING PROUD IN THE UNDERTAKING WHICH ALLURED HIM IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING. OH, HE MIGHT HAVE ACCEPTED VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS LUXURIOUS PROVISION AND HAVE REMAINED LIVING ON HER CHARITY, ‚ÄÚCOMME UN HUMBLE DEPENDENT.‚ÄÙ BUT HE HAD NOT ACCEPTED HER CHARITY AND WAS NOT REMAINING! AND HERE HE WAS LEAVING HER OF HIMSELF, AND HOLDING ALOFT THE ‚ÄÚSTANDARD OF A GREAT IDEA, AND GOING TO DIE FOR IT ON THE OPEN ROAD.‚ÄÙ THAT IS HOW HE MUST HAVE BEEN FEELING; THAT‚ÄÔS HOW HIS ACTION MUST HAVE APPEARED TO HIM.

ANOTHER QUESTION PRESENTED ITSELF TO ME MORE THAN ONCE. WHY DID HE RUN AWAY, THAT IS, LITERALLY RUN AWAY ON FOOT, RATHER THAN SIMPLY DRIVE AWAY? I PUT IT DOWN AT FIRST TO THE IMPRACTICABILITY OF FIFTY YEARS AND THE FANTASTIC BENT OF HIS MIND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF STRONG EMOTION. I IMAGINED THAT THE THOUGHT OF POSTING TICKETS AND HORSES (EVEN IF THEY HAD BELLS) WOULD HAVE SEEMED TOO SIMPLE AND PROSAIC TO HIM; A PILGRIMAGE, ON THE OTHER HAND, EVEN UNDER AN UMBRELLA, WAS EVER SO MUCH MORE PICTURESQUE AND IN CHARACTER WITH LOVE AND RESENTMENT. BUT NOW THAT EVERYTHING IS OVER, I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT IT ALL CAME ABOUT IN A MUCH SIMPLER WAY. TO BEGIN WITH, HE WAS AFRAID TO HIRE HORSES BECAUSE VARVARA PETROVNA MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF IT AND PREVENTED HIM FROM GOING BY FORCE; WHICH SHE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE DONE, AND HE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE GIVEN IN, AND THEN FAREWELL TO THE GREAT IDEA FOREVER. BESIDES, TO TAKE TICKETS FOR ANYWHERE HE MUST HAVE KNOWN AT LEAST WHERE HE WAS GOING. BUT TO THINK ABOUT THAT WAS THE GREATEST AGONY TO HIM AT THAT MOMENT; HE WAS UTTERLY UNABLE TO FIX UPON A PLACE. FOR IF HE HAD TO FIX ON ANY PARTICULAR TOWN HIS ENTERPRISE WOULD AT ONCE HAVE SEEMED IN HIS OWN EYES ABSURD AND IMPOSSIBLE; HE FELT THAT VERY STRONGLY. WHAT SHOULD HE DO IN THAT PARTICULAR TOWN RATHER THAN IN ANY OTHER? LOOK OUT FOR CE MARCHAND? BUT WHAT MARCHAND? AT THAT POINT HIS SECOND AND MOST TERRIBLE QUESTION CROPPED UP. IN REALITY THERE WAS NOTHING HE DREADED MORE THAN CE MARCHAND, WHOM HE HAD RUSHED OFF TO SEEK SO RECKLESSLY, THOUGH, OF COURSE, HE WAS TERRIBLY AFRAID OF FINDING HIM. NO, BETTER SIMPLY THE HIGH ROAD, BETTER SIMPLY TO SET OFF FOR IT, AND WALK ALONG IT AND TO THINK OF NOTHING SO LONG AS HE COULD PUT OFF THINKING. THE HIGH ROAD IS SOMETHING VERY VERY LONG, OF WHICH ONE CANNOT SEE THE END‚ÄÎLIKE HUMAN LIFE, LIKE HUMAN DREAMS. THERE IS AN IDEA IN THE OPEN ROAD, BUT WHAT SORT OF IDEA IS THERE IN TRAVELLING WITH POSTING TICKETS? POSTING TICKETS MEAN AN END TO IDEAS. VIVE LA GRANDE ROUTE AND THEN AS GOD WILLS.

AFTER THE SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED INTERVIEW WITH LIZA WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED, HE RUSHED ON, MORE LOST IN FORGETFULNESS THAN EVER. THE HIGH ROAD PASSED HALF A MILE FROM SKVORESHNIKI AND, STRANGE TO SAY, HE WAS NOT AT FIRST AWARE THAT HE WAS ON IT. LOGICAL REASONING OR EVEN DISTINCT CONSCIOUSNESS WAS UNBEARABLE TO HIM AT THIS MOMENT. A FINE RAIN KEPT DRIZZLING, CEASING, AND DRIZZLING AGAIN; BUT HE DID NOT EVEN NOTICE THE RAIN. HE DID NOT EVEN NOTICE EITHER HOW HE THREW HIS BAG OVER HIS SHOULDER, NOR HOW MUCH MORE COMFORTABLY HE WALKED WITH IT SO. HE MUST HAVE WALKED LIKE THAT FOR NEARLY A MILE OR SO WHEN HE SUDDENLY STOOD STILL AND LOOKED ROUND. THE OLD ROAD, BLACK, MARKED WITH WHEEL-RUTS AND PLANTED WITH WILLOWS ON EACH SIDE, RAN BEFORE HIM LIKE AN ENDLESS THREAD; ON THE RIGHT HAND WERE BARE PLAINS FROM WHICH THE HARVEST HAD LONG AGO BEEN CARRIED; ON THE LEFT THERE WERE BUSHES AND IN THE DISTANCE BEYOND THEM A COPSE.

AND FAR, FAR AWAY A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE LINE OF THE RAILWAY, RUNNING ASLANT, AND ON IT THE SMOKE OF A TRAIN, BUT NO SOUND WAS HEARD. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH FELT A LITTLE TIMID, BUT ONLY FOR A MOMENT. HE HEAVED A VAGUE SIGH, PUT DOWN HIS BAG BESIDE A WILLOW, AND SAT DOWN TO REST. AS HE MOVED TO SIT DOWN HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BEING CHILLY AND WRAPPED HIMSELF IN HIS RUG; NOTICING AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT WAS RAINING, HE PUT UP HIS UMBRELLA. HE SAT LIKE THAT FOR SOME TIME, MOVING HIS LIPS FROM TIME TO TIME AND FIRMLY GRASPING THE UMBRELLA HANDLE. IMAGES OF ALL SORTS PASSED IN FEVERISH PROCESSION BEFORE HIM, RAPIDLY SUCCEEDING ONE ANOTHER IN HIS MIND.

‚ÄÚLISE, LISE,‚ÄÙ HE THOUGHT, ‚ÄÚAND WITH HER CE MAURICE.‚Ä¶ STRANGE PEOPLE.‚Ä¶ BUT WHAT WAS THE STRANGE FIRE, AND WHAT WERE THEY TALKING ABOUT, AND WHO WERE MURDERED? I FANCY NASTASYA HAS NOT FOUND OUT YET AND IS STILL WAITING FOR ME WITH MY COFFEE ‚Ä¶ CARDS? DID I REALLY LOSE MEN AT CARDS? H‚ÄÔM! AMONG US IN RUSSIA IN THE TIMES OF SERFDOM, SO CALLED.‚Ä¶ MY GOD, YES‚ÄÎFEDKA!‚ÄÙ

HE STARTED ALL OVER WITH TERROR AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM. ‚ÄÚWHAT IF THAT FEDKA IS IN HIDING SOMEWHERE BEHIND THE BUSHES? THEY SAY HE HAS A REGULAR BAND OF ROBBERS HERE ON THE HIGH ROAD. OH, MERCY, I ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔLL TELL HIM THE WHOLE TRUTH THEN, THAT I WAS TO BLAME ‚Ä¶ AND THAT I‚ÄÔVE BEEN MISERABLE ABOUT HIM FOR TEN YEARS. MORE MISERABLE THAN HE WAS AS A SOLDIER, AND ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔLL GIVE HIM MY PURSE. H‚ÄÔM! J‚ÄÔAI EN TOUT QUARANTE ROUBLES; IL PRENDRA LES ROUBLES ET IL ME TUERA TOUT DE M√™ME.‚ÄÙ

IN HIS PANIC HE FOR SOME REASON SHUT UP THE UMBRELLA AND LAID IT DOWN BESIDE HIM. A CART CAME INTO SIGHT ON THE HIGH ROAD IN THE DISTANCE COMING FROM THE TOWN.

‚ÄÚGRACE √† DIEU, THAT‚ÄÔS A CART AND IT‚ÄÔS COMING AT A WALKING PACE; THAT CAN‚ÄÔT BE DANGEROUS. THE WRETCHED LITTLE HORSES HERE ‚Ä¶ I ALWAYS SAID THAT BREED ‚Ä¶ IT WAS PYOTR ILYITCH THOUGH, HE TALKED AT THE CLUB ABOUT HORSE-BREEDING AND I TRUMPED HIM, ET PUIS ‚Ä¶ BUT WHAT‚ÄÔS THAT BEHIND?‚Ä¶ I BELIEVE THERE‚ÄÔS A WOMAN IN THE CART. A PEASANT AND A WOMAN, CELA COMMENCE √† √™TRE RASSURANT. THE WOMAN BEHIND AND THE MAN IN FRONT‚ÄÎ C‚ÄÔEST TR√®S RASSURANT. THERE‚ÄÔS A COW BEHIND THE CART TIED BY THE HORNS, C‚ÄÔEST RASSURANT AU PLUS HAUT DEGR√©.‚ÄÙ

THE CART REACHED HIM; IT WAS A FAIRLY SOLID PEASANT CART. THE WOMAN WAS SITTING ON A TIGHTLY STUFFED SACK AND THE MAN ON THE FRONT OF THE CART WITH HIS LEGS HANGING OVER TOWARDS STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. A RED COW WAS, IN FACT, SHAMBLING BEHIND, TIED BY THE HORNS TO THE CART. THE MAN AND THE WOMAN GAZED OPEN-EYED AT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, AND STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH GAZED BACK AT THEM WITH EQUAL WONDER, BUT AFTER HE HAD LET THEM PASS TWENTY PACES, HE GOT UP HURRIEDLY ALL OF A SUDDEN AND WALKED AFTER THEM. IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE CART IT WAS NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD FEEL SAFER, BUT WHEN HE HAD OVERTAKEN IT HE BECAME OBLIVIOUS OF EVERYTHING AGAIN AND SANK BACK INTO HIS DISCONNECTED THOUGHTS AND FANCIES. HE STEPPED ALONG WITH NO SUSPICION, OF COURSE, THAT FOR THE TWO PEASANTS HE WAS AT THAT INSTANT THE MOST MYSTERIOUS AND INTERESTING OBJECT THAT ONE COULD MEET ON THE HIGH ROAD.

‚ÄÚWHAT SORT MAY YOU BE, PRAY, IF IT‚ÄÔS NOT UNCIVIL TO ASK?‚ÄÙ THE WOMAN COULD NOT RESIST ASKING AT LAST WHEN STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH GLANCED ABSENT-MINDEDLY AT HER. SHE WAS A WOMAN OF ABOUT SEVEN AND TWENTY, STURDILY BUILT, WITH BLACK EYEBROWS, ROSY CHEEKS, AND A FRIENDLY SMILE ON HER RED LIPS, BETWEEN WHICH GLEAMED WHITE EVEN TEETH.

‚ÄÚYOU ‚Ä¶ YOU ARE ADDRESSING ME?‚ÄÙ MUTTERED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WITH MOURNFUL WONDER.

‚ÄÚA MERCHANT, FOR SURE,‚ÄÙ THE PEASANT OBSERVED CONFIDENTLY. HE WAS A WELL-GROWN MAN OF FORTY WITH A BROAD AND INTELLIGENT FACE, FRAMED IN A REDDISH BEARD.

‚ÄÚNO, I AM NOT EXACTLY A MERCHANT, I ‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶ MOI C‚ÄÔEST AUTRE CHOSE.‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH PARRIED THE QUESTION SOMEHOW, AND TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE HE DROPPED BACK A LITTLE FROM THE CART, SO THAT HE WAS WALKING ON A LEVEL WITH THE COW.

‚ÄÚMUST BE A GENTLEMAN,‚ÄÙ THE MAN DECIDED, HEARING WORDS NOT RUSSIAN, AND HE GAVE A TUG AT THE HORSE.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS WHAT SET US WONDERING. YOU ARE OUT FOR A WALK SEEMINGLY?‚ÄÙ THE WOMAN ASKED INQUISITIVELY AGAIN.

‚ÄÚYOU ‚Ä¶ YOU ASK ME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFOREIGNERS COME FROM OTHER PARTS SOMETIMES BY THE TRAIN; YOUR BOOTS DON‚ÄÔT SEEM TO BE FROM HEREABOUTS.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHEY ARE ARMY BOOTS,‚ÄÙ THE MAN PUT IN COMPLACENTLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY.

‚ÄÚNO, I AM NOT PRECISELY IN THE ARMY, I ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT AN INQUISITIVE WOMAN!‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH MUSED WITH VEXATION. ‚ÄÚAND HOW THEY STARE AT ME ‚Ä¶ MAIS ENFIN. IN FACT, IT‚ÄÔS STRANGE THAT I FEEL, AS IT WERE, CONSCIENCE-STRICKEN BEFORE THEM, AND YET I‚ÄÔVE DONE THEM NO HARM.‚ÄÙ

THE WOMAN WAS WHISPERING TO THE MAN.

‚ÄÚIF IT‚ÄÔS NO OFFENCE, WE‚ÄÔD GIVE YOU A LIFT IF SO BE IT‚ÄÔS AGREEABLE.‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SUDDENLY ROUSED HIMSELF.

‚ÄÚYES, YES, MY FRIENDS, I ACCEPT IT WITH PLEASURE, FOR I‚ÄÔM VERY TIRED; BUT HOW AM I TO GET IN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW WONDERFUL IT IS,‚ÄÙ HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF, ‚ÄÚTHAT I‚ÄÔVE BEEN WALKING SO LONG BESIDE THAT COW AND IT NEVER ENTERED MY HEAD TO ASK THEM FOR A LIFT. THIS ‚ÄÒREAL LIFE‚ÄÔ HAS SOMETHING VERY ORIGINAL ABOUT IT.‚ÄÙ

BUT THE PEASANT HAD NOT, HOWEVER, PULLED UP THE HORSE.

‚ÄÚBUT WHERE ARE YOU BOUND FOR?‚ÄÙ HE ASKED WITH SOME MISTRUSTFULNESS.

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIM AT ONCE.

‚ÄÚTO HATOVO, I SUPPOSE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHATOV? NO, NOT TO HATOV‚ÄÔS EXACTLY ‚Ä¶ AND I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HIM THOUGH I‚ÄÔVE HEARD OF HIM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE VILLAGE OF HATOVO, THE VILLAGE, SEVEN MILES FROM HERE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚA VILLAGE? C‚ÄÔEST CHARMANT, TO BE SURE I‚ÄÔVE HEARD OF IT.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS STILL WALKING, THEY HAD NOT YET TAKEN HIM INTO THE CART. A GUESS THAT WAS A STROKE OF GENIUS FLASHED THROUGH HIS MIND.

‚ÄÚYOU THINK PERHAPS THAT I AM ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔVE GOT A PASSPORT AND I AM A PROFESSOR, THAT IS, IF YOU LIKE, A TEACHER ‚Ä¶ BUT A HEAD TEACHER. I AM A HEAD TEACHER. OUI, C‚ÄÔEST COMME √ßA QU‚ÄÔON PEUT TRADUIRE. I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD OF A LIFT AND I‚ÄÔLL BUY YOU ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔLL BUY YOU A QUART OF VODKA FOR IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔLL BE HALF A ROUBLE, SIR; IT‚ÄÔS A BAD ROAD.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOR IT WOULDN‚ÄÔT BE FAIR TO OURSELVES,‚ÄÙ PUT IN THE WOMAN.

‚ÄÚHALF A ROUBLE? VERY GOOD THEN, HALF A ROUBLE. C‚ÄÔEST ENCORE MIEUX; J‚ÄÔAI EN TOUT QUARANTE ROUBLES MAIS ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

THE PEASANT STOPPED THE HORSE AND BY THEIR UNITED EFFORTS STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS DRAGGED INTO THE CART, AND SEATED ON THE SACK BY THE WOMAN. HE WAS STILL PURSUED BY THE SAME WHIRL OF IDEAS. SOMETIMES HE WAS AWARE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS TERRIBLY ABSENT-MINDED, AND THAT HE WAS NOT THINKING OF WHAT HE OUGHT TO BE THINKING OF AND WONDERED AT IT. THIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF ABNORMAL WEAKNESS OF MIND BECAME AT MOMENTS VERY PAINFUL AND EVEN HUMILIATING TO HIM.

‚ÄÚHOW ‚Ä¶ HOW IS THIS YOU‚ÄÔVE GOT A COW BEHIND?‚ÄÙ HE SUDDENLY ASKED THE WOMAN.

‚ÄÚWHAT DO YOU MEAN, SIR, AS THOUGH YOU‚ÄÔD NEVER SEEN ONE,‚ÄÙ LAUGHED THE WOMAN.

‚ÄÚWE BOUGHT IT IN THE TOWN,‚ÄÙ THE PEASANT PUT IN. ‚ÄÚOUR CATTLE DIED LAST SPRING ‚Ä¶ THE PLAGUE. ALL THE BEASTS HAVE DIED ROUND US, ALL OF THEM. THERE AREN‚ÄÔT HALF OF THEM LEFT, IT‚ÄÔS HEARTBREAKING.‚ÄÙ

AND AGAIN HE LASHED THE HORSE, WHICH HAD GOT STUCK IN A RUT.

‚ÄÚYES, THAT DOES HAPPEN AMONG YOU IN RUSSIA ‚Ä¶ IN GENERAL WE RUSSIANS ‚Ä¶ WELL, YES, IT HAPPENS,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH BROKE OFF.

‚ÄÚIF YOU ARE A TEACHER, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO HATOVO FOR? MAYBE YOU ARE GOING ON FARTHER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI ‚Ä¶ I‚ÄÔM NOT GOING FARTHER PRECISELY.‚Ä¶ C‚ÄÔEST-√†-DIRE, I‚ÄÔM GOING TO A MERCHANT‚ÄÔS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO SPASOV, I SUPPOSE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, YES, TO SPASOV. BUT THAT‚ÄÔS NO MATTER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIF YOU ARE GOING TO SPASOV AND ON FOOT, IT WILL TAKE YOU A WEEK IN YOUR BOOTS,‚ÄÙ LAUGHED THE WOMAN.

‚ÄÚI DARE SAY, I DARE SAY, NO MATTER, MES AMIS, NO MATTER.‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH CUT HER SHORT IMPATIENTLY.

‚ÄÚAWFULLY INQUISITIVE PEOPLE; BUT THE WOMAN SPEAKS BETTER THAN HE DOES, AND I NOTICE THAT SINCE FEBRUARY 19,* THEIR LANGUAGE HAS ALTERED A LITTLE, AND ‚Ä¶ AND WHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF MINE WHETHER I‚ÄÔM GOING TO SPASOV OR NOT? BESIDES, I‚ÄÔLL PAY THEM, SO WHY DO THEY PESTER ME.‚ÄÙ

     *FEBRUARY 19, 1861, THE DAY OF THE EMANCIPATION OF THE SERFS, IS
MEANT.‚ÄÎTRANSLATOR‚ÄÔS NOTE.
‚ÄÚIF YOU ARE GOING TO SPASOV, YOU MUST TAKE THE STEAMER,‚ÄÙ THE PEASANT PERSISTED.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS TRUE INDEED,‚ÄÙ THE WOMAN PUT IN WITH ANIMATION, ‚ÄÚFOR IF YOU DRIVE ALONG THE BANK IT‚ÄÔS TWENTY-FIVE MILES OUT OF THE WAY.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHIRTY-FIVE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔLL JUST CATCH THE STEAMER AT USTYEVO AT TWO O‚ÄÔCLOCK TOMORROW,‚ÄÙ THE WOMAN DECIDED FINALLY. BUT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS OBSTINATELY SILENT. HIS QUESTIONERS, TOO, SANK INTO SILENCE. THE PEASANT TUGGED AT HIS HORSE AT RARE INTERVALS; THE PEASANT WOMAN EXCHANGED BRIEF REMARKS WITH HIM. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH FELL INTO A DOZE. HE WAS TREMENDOUSLY SURPRISED WHEN THE WOMAN, LAUGHING, GAVE HIM A POKE AND HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A RATHER LARGE VILLAGE AT THE DOOR OF A COTTAGE WITH THREE WINDOWS.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE HAD A NAP, SIR?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT IS IT? WHERE AM I? AH, YES! WELL ‚Ä¶ NEVER MIND,‚ÄÙ SIGHED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, AND HE GOT OUT OF THE CART.

HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM MOURNFULLY; THE VILLAGE SCENE SEEMED STRANGE TO HIM AND SOMEHOW TERRIBLY REMOTE.

‚ÄÚAND THE HALF-ROUBLE, I WAS FORGETTING IT!‚ÄÙ HE SAID TO THE PEASANT, TURNING TO HIM WITH AN EXCESSIVELY HURRIED GESTURE; HE WAS EVIDENTLY BY NOW AFRAID TO PART FROM THEM.

‚ÄÚWE‚ÄÔLL SETTLE INDOORS, WALK IN,‚ÄÙ THE PEASANT INVITED HIM.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS COMFORTABLE INSIDE,‚ÄÙ THE WOMAN SAID REASSURINGLY.

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH MOUNTED THE SHAKY STEPS. ‚ÄÚHOW CAN IT BE?‚ÄÙ HE MURMURED IN PROFOUND AND APPREHENSIVE PERPLEXITY. HE WENT INTO THE COTTAGE, HOWEVER. ‚ÄÚELLE L‚ÄÔA VOULU‚ÄÙ HE FELT A STAB AT HIS HEART AND AGAIN HE BECAME OBLIVIOUS OF EVERYTHING, EVEN OF THE FACT THAT HE HAD GONE INTO THE COTTAGE.

IT WAS A LIGHT AND FAIRLY CLEAN PEASANT‚ÄÔS COTTAGE, WITH THREE WINDOWS AND TWO ROOMS; NOT EXACTLY AN INN, BUT A COTTAGE AT WHICH PEOPLE WHO KNEW THE PLACE WERE ACCUSTOMED TO STOP ON THEIR WAY THROUGH THE VILLAGE. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, QUITE UNEMBARRASSED, WENT TO THE FOREMOST CORNER; FORGOT TO GREET ANYONE, SAT DOWN AND SANK INTO THOUGHT. MEANWHILE A SENSATION OF WARMTH, EXTREMELY AGREEABLE AFTER THREE HOURS OF TRAVELLING IN THE DAMP, WAS SUDDENLY DIFFUSED THROUGHOUT HIS PERSON. EVEN THE SLIGHT SHIVERS THAT SPASMODICALLY RAN DOWN HIS SPINE‚ÄÎSUCH AS ALWAYS OCCUR IN PARTICULARLY NERVOUS PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE FEVERISH AND HAVE SUDDENLY COME INTO A WARM ROOM FROM THE COLD‚ÄÎBECAME ALL AT ONCE STRANGELY AGREEABLE. HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND THE DELICIOUS FRAGRANCE OF THE HOT PANCAKES WITH WHICH THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE WAS BUSY AT THE STOVE TICKLED HIS NOSTRILS. WITH A CHILDLIKE SMILE HE LEANED TOWARDS THE WOMAN AND SUDDENLY SAID:

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THAT? ARE THEY PANCAKES? MAIS ‚Ä¶ C‚ÄÔEST CHARMANT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWOULD YOU LIKE SOME, SIR?‚ÄÙ THE WOMAN POLITELY OFFERED HIM AT ONCE.

‚ÄÚI SHOULD LIKE SOME, I CERTAINLY SHOULD, AND ‚Ä¶ MAY I ASK YOU FOR SOME TEA TOO,‚ÄÙ SAID STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, REVIVING.

‚ÄÚGET THE SAMOVAR? WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE.‚ÄÙ

ON A LARGE PLATE WITH A BIG BLUE PATTERN ON IT WERE SERVED THE PANCAKES‚ÄÎREGULAR PEASANT PANCAKES, THIN, MADE HALF OF WHEAT, COVERED WITH FRESH HOT BUTTER, MOST DELICIOUS PANCAKES. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH TASTED THEM WITH RELISH.

‚ÄÚHOW RICH THEY ARE AND HOW GOOD! AND IF ONE COULD ONLY HAVE UN DOIGT D‚ÄÔEAU DE VIE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS A DROP OF VODKA YOU WOULD LIKE, SIR, ISN‚ÄÔT IT?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚJUST SO, JUST SO, A LITTLE, UN TOUT PETIT RIEN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFIVE FARTHINGS‚ÄÔ WORTH, I SUPPOSE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚFIVE, YES, FIVE, FIVE, FIVE, UN TOUT PETIT RIEN,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH ASSENTED WITH A BLISSFUL SMILE.

ASK A PEASANT TO DO ANYTHING FOR YOU, AND IF HE CAN, AND WILL, HE WILL SERVE YOU WITH CARE AND FRIENDLINESS; BUT ASK HIM TO FETCH YOU VODKA‚ÄÎAND HIS HABITUAL SERENITY AND FRIENDLINESS WILL PASS AT ONCE INTO A SORT OF JOYFUL HASTE AND ALACRITY; HE WILL BE AS KEEN IN YOUR INTEREST AS THOUGH YOU WERE ONE OF HIS FAMILY. THE PEASANT WHO FETCHES VODKA‚ÄÎEVEN THOUGH YOU ARE GOING TO DRINK IT AND NOT HE AND HE KNOWS THAT BEFOREHAND‚ÄÎSEEMS, AS IT WERE, TO BE ENJOYING PART OF YOUR FUTURE GRATIFICATION. WITHIN THREE MINUTES (THE TAVERN WAS ONLY TWO PACES AWAY), A BOTTLE AND A LARGE GREENISH WINEGLASS WERE SET ON THE TABLE BEFORE STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.

‚ÄÚIS THAT ALL FOR ME!‚ÄÙ HE WAS EXTREMELY SURPRISED. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE ALWAYS HAD VODKA BUT I NEVER KNEW YOU COULD GET SO MUCH FOR FIVE FARTHINGS.‚ÄÙ

HE FILLED THE WINEGLASS, GOT UP AND WITH A CERTAIN SOLEMNITY CROSSED THE ROOM TO THE OTHER CORNER WHERE HIS FELLOW-TRAVELLER, THE BLACK-BROWED PEASANT WOMAN, WHO HAD SHARED THE SACK WITH HIM AND BOTHERED HIM WITH HER QUESTIONS, HAD ENSCONCED HERSELF. THE WOMAN WAS TAKEN ABACK, AND BEGAN TO DECLINE, BUT AFTER HAVING SAID ALL THAT WAS PRESCRIBED BY POLITENESS, SHE STOOD UP AND DRANK IT DECOROUSLY IN THREE SIPS, AS WOMEN DO, AND, WITH AN EXPRESSION OF INTENSE SUFFERING ON HER FACE, GAVE BACK THE WINEGLASS AND BOWED TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. HE RETURNED THE BOW WITH DIGNITY AND RETURNED TO THE TABLE WITH AN EXPRESSION OF POSITIVE PRIDE ON HIS COUNTENANCE.

ALL THIS WAS DONE ON THE INSPIRATION OF THE MOMENT: A SECOND BEFORE HE HAD NO IDEA THAT HE WOULD GO AND TREAT THE PEASANT WOMAN.

‚ÄÚI KNOW HOW TO GET ON WITH PEASANTS TO PERFECTION, TO PERFECTION, AND I‚ÄÔVE ALWAYS TOLD THEM SO,‚ÄÙ HE THOUGHT COMPLACENTLY, POURING OUT THE REST OF THE VODKA; THOUGH THERE WAS LESS THAN A GLASS LEFT, IT WARMED AND REVIVED HIM, AND EVEN WENT A LITTLE TO HIS HEAD.

‚ÄÚJE SUIS MALADE TOUT √† FAIT, MAIS CE N‚ÄÔEST PAS TROP MAUVAIS D‚ÄÔ√™TRE MALADE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWOULD YOU CARE TO PURCHASE?‚ÄÙ A GENTLE FEMININE VOICE ASKED CLOSE BY HIM.

HE RAISED HIS EYES AND TO HIS SURPRISE SAW A LADY‚ÄÎUNE DAME ET ELLE EN AVAIT L‚ÄÔAIR, SOMEWHAT OVER THIRTY, VERY MODEST IN APPEARANCE, DRESSED NOT LIKE A PEASANT, IN A DARK GOWN WITH A GREY SHAWL ON HER SHOULDERS. THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY KINDLY IN HER FACE WHICH ATTRACTED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH IMMEDIATELY. SHE HAD ONLY JUST COME BACK TO THE COTTAGE, WHERE HER THINGS HAD BEEN LEFT ON A BENCH CLOSE BY THE PLACE WHERE STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HAD SEATED HIMSELF. AMONG THEM WAS A PORTFOLIO, AT WHICH HE REMEMBERED HE HAD LOOKED WITH CURIOSITY ON GOING IN, AND A PACK, NOT VERY LARGE, OF AMERICAN LEATHER. FROM THIS PACK SHE TOOK OUT TWO NICELY BOUND BOOKS WITH A CROSS ENGRAVED ON THE COVER, AND OFFERED THEM TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.

‚ÄÚET ‚Ä¶ MAIS JE CROIS QUE C‚ÄÔEST L‚ÄÔEVANGILE ‚Ä¶ WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE.‚Ä¶ AH, NOW I UNDERSTAND.‚Ä¶ VOUS √™TES CE QU‚ÄÔON APPELLE A GOSPEL-WOMAN; I‚ÄÔVE READ MORE THAN ONCE.‚Ä¶ HALF A ROUBLE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHIRTY-FIVE KOPECKS,‚ÄÙ ANSWERED THE GOSPEL-WOMAN. ‚ÄÚWITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE. JE N‚ÄÔAI RIEN CONTRE L‚ÄÔEVANGILE, AND I‚ÄÔVE BEEN WANTING TO RE-READ IT FOR A LONG TIME.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

THE IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM AT THE MOMENT THAT HE HAD NOT READ THE GOSPEL FOR THIRTY YEARS AT LEAST, AND AT MOST HAD RECALLED SOME PASSAGES OF IT, SEVEN YEARS BEFORE, WHEN READING RENAN‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚVIE DE J√©SUS.‚ÄÙ AS HE HAD NO SMALL CHANGE HE PULLED OUT HIS FOUR TEN-ROUBLE NOTES‚ÄÎALL THAT HE HAD. THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE UNDERTOOK TO GET CHANGE, AND ONLY THEN HE NOTICED, LOOKING ROUND, THAT A GOOD MANY PEOPLE HAD COME INTO THE COTTAGE, AND THAT THEY HAD ALL BEEN WATCHING HIM FOR SOME TIME PAST, AND SEEMED TO BE TALKING ABOUT HIM. THEY WERE TALKING TOO OF THE FIRE IN THE TOWN, ESPECIALLY THE OWNER OF THE CART WHO HAD ONLY JUST RETURNED FROM THE TOWN WITH THE COW. THEY TALKED OF ARSON, OF THE SHPIGULIN MEN.

‚ÄÚHE SAID NOTHING TO ME ABOUT THE FIRE WHEN HE BROUGHT ME ALONG, ALTHOUGH HE TALKED OF EVERYTHING,‚ÄÙ STRUCK STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH FOR SOME REASON.

‚ÄÚMASTER, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, SIR, IS IT YOU I SEE? WELL, I NEVER SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT!‚Ä¶ DON‚ÄÔT YOU KNOW ME?‚ÄÙ EXCLAIMED A MIDDLE-AGED MAN WHO LOOKED LIKE AN OLD-FASHIONED HOUSE-SERF, WEARING NO BEARD AND DRESSED IN AN OVERCOAT WITH A WIDE TURN-DOWN COLLAR. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS ALARMED AT HEARING HIS OWN NAME.

‚ÄÚEXCUSE ME,‚ÄÙ HE MUTTERED, ‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT QUITE REMEMBER YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU DON‚ÄÔT REMEMBER ME. I AM ANISIM, ANISIM IVANOV. I USED TO BE IN THE SERVICE OF THE LATE MR. GAGANOV, AND MANY‚ÄÔS THE TIME I‚ÄÔVE SEEN YOU, SIR, WITH VARVARA PETROVNA AT THE LATE AVDOTYA SERGYEVNA‚ÄÔS. I USED TO GO TO YOU WITH BOOKS FROM HER, AND TWICE I BROUGHT YOU PETERSBURG SWEETS FROM HER.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, YES, I REMEMBER YOU, ANISIM,‚ÄÙ SAID STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, SMILING. ‚ÄÚDO YOU LIVE HERE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI LIVE NEAR SPASOV, CLOSE TO THE V‚ÄÎ‚ÄÎ MONASTERY, IN THE SERVICE OF MARTA SERGYEVNA, AVDOTYA SERGYEVNA‚ÄÔS SISTER. PERHAPS YOUR HONOUR REMEMBERS HER; SHE BROKE HER LEG FALLING OUT OF HER CARRIAGE ON HER WAY TO A BALL. NOW HER HONOUR LIVES NEAR THE MONASTERY, AND I AM IN HER SERVICE. AND NOW AS YOUR HONOUR SEES, I AM ON MY WAY TO THE TOWN TO SEE MY KINSFOLK.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚQUITE SO, QUITE SO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI FELT SO PLEASED WHEN I SAW YOU, YOU USED TO BE SO KIND TO ME,‚ÄÙ ANISIM SMILED DELIGHTEDLY. ‚ÄÚBUT WHERE ARE YOU TRAVELLING TO, SIR, ALL BY YOURSELF AS IT SEEMS.‚Ä¶ YOU‚ÄÔVE NEVER BEEN A JOURNEY ALONE, I FANCY?‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH LOOKED AT HIM IN ALARM.

‚ÄÚYOU ARE GOING, MAYBE, TO OUR PARTS, TO SPASOV?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, I AM GOING TO SPASOV. IL ME SEMBLE QUE TOUT LE MONDE VA √† SPASSOF.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU DON‚ÄÔT SAY IT‚ÄÔS TO FYODOR MATVEYEVITCH‚ÄÔS? THEY WILL BE PLEASED TO SEE YOU. HE HAD SUCH A RESPECT FOR YOU IN OLD DAYS; HE OFTEN SPEAKS OF YOU NOW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, YES, TO FYODOR MATVEYEVITCH‚ÄÔS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTO BE SURE, TO BE SURE. THE PEASANTS HERE ARE WONDERING; THEY MAKE OUT THEY MET YOU, SIR, WALKING ON THE HIGH ROAD. THEY ARE A FOOLISH LOT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI ‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶ YES, YOU KNOW, ANISIM, I MADE A WAGER, YOU KNOW, LIKE AN ENGLISHMAN, THAT I WOULD GO ON FOOT AND I ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

THE PERSPIRATION CAME OUT ON HIS FOREHEAD.

‚ÄÚTO BE SURE, TO BE SURE.‚ÄÙ ANISIM LISTENED WITH MERCILESS CURIOSITY. BUT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER. HE WAS SO DISCONCERTED THAT HE WAS ON THE POINT OF GETTING UP AND GOING OUT OF THE COTTAGE. BUT THE SAMOVAR WAS BROUGHT IN, AND AT THE SAME MOMENT THE GOSPEL-WOMAN, WHO HAD BEEN OUT OF THE ROOM, RETURNED. WITH THE AIR OF A MAN CLUTCHING AT A STRAW HE TURNED TO HER AND OFFERED HER TEA. ANISIM SUBMITTED AND WALKED AWAY.

THE PEASANTS CERTAINLY HAD BEGUN TO FEEL PERPLEXED: ‚ÄÚWHAT SORT OF PERSON IS HE? HE WAS FOUND WALKING ON THE HIGH ROAD, HE SAYS HE IS A TEACHER, HE IS DRESSED LIKE A FOREIGNER, AND HAS NO MORE SENSE THAN A LITTLE CHILD; HE ANSWERS QUEERLY AS THOUGH HE HAD RUN AWAY FROM SOMEONE, AND HE‚ÄÔS GOT MONEY!‚ÄÙ AN IDEA WAS BEGINNING TO GAIN GROUND THAT INFORMATION MUST BE GIVEN TO THE AUTHORITIES, ‚ÄÚESPECIALLY AS THINGS WEREN‚ÄÔT QUITE RIGHT IN THE TOWN.‚ÄÙ BUT ANISIM SET ALL THAT RIGHT IN A MINUTE. GOING INTO THE PASSAGE HE EXPLAINED TO EVERY ONE WHO CARED TO LISTEN THAT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS NOT EXACTLY A TEACHER BUT ‚ÄÚA VERY LEARNED MAN AND BUSY WITH VERY LEARNED STUDIES, AND WAS A LANDOWNER OF THE DISTRICT HIMSELF, AND HAD BEEN LIVING FOR TWENTY-TWO YEARS WITH HER EXCELLENCY, THE GENERAL‚ÄÔS WIDOW, THE STOUT MADAME STAVROGIN, AND WAS BY WAY OF BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON IN HER HOUSE, AND WAS HELD IN THE GREATEST RESPECT BY EVERY ONE IN THE TOWN. HE USED TO LOSE BY FIFTIES AND HUNDREDS IN AN EVENING AT THE CLUB OF THE NOBILITY, AND IN RANK HE WAS A COUNCILLOR, WHICH WAS EQUAL TO A LIEUTENANT-COLONEL IN THE ARMY, WHICH WAS NEXT DOOR TO BEING A COLONEL. AS FOR HIS HAVING MONEY, HE HAD SO MUCH FROM THE STOUT MADAME STAVROGIN THAT THERE WAS NO RECKONING IT‚ÄÙ‚ÄÎAND SO ON AND SO ON.

‚ÄÚMAIS C‚ÄÔEST UNE DAME ET TR√®S COMME IL FAUT,‚ÄÙ THOUGHT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, AS HE RECOVERED FROM ANISIM‚ÄÔS ATTACK, GAZING WITH AGREEABLE CURIOSITY AT HIS NEIGHBOUR, THE GOSPEL PEDLAR, WHO WAS, HOWEVER, DRINKING THE TEA FROM A SAUCER AND NIBBLING AT A PIECE OF SUGAR. ‚ÄÚCE PETIT MORCEAU DE SUCRE, CE N‚ÄÔEST RIEN.‚Ä¶ THERE IS SOMETHING NOBLE AND INDEPENDENT ABOUT HER, AND AT THE SAME TIME‚ÄÎGENTLE. LE COMME IL FAUT TOUT PUR, BUT RATHER IN A DIFFERENT STYLE.‚ÄÙ

HE SOON LEARNED FROM HER THAT HER NAME WAS SOFYA MATVEYEVNA ULITIN AND SHE LIVED AT K‚ÄÎ‚ÄÎ, THAT SHE HAD A SISTER THERE, A WIDOW; THAT SHE WAS A WIDOW TOO, AND THAT HER HUSBAND, WHO WAS A SUB-LIEUTENANT RISEN FROM THE RANKS, HAD BEEN KILLED AT SEVASTOPOL.

‚ÄÚBUT YOU ARE STILL SO YOUNG, VOUS N‚ÄÔAVEZ PAS TRENTE ANS.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHIRTY-FOUR,‚ÄÙ SAID SOFYA MATVEYEVNA, SMILING.

‚ÄÚWHAT, YOU UNDERSTAND FRENCH?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚA LITTLE. I LIVED FOR FOUR YEARS AFTER THAT IN A GENTLEMAN‚ÄÔS FAMILY, AND THERE I PICKED IT UP FROM THE CHILDREN.‚ÄÙ

SHE TOLD HIM THAT BEING LEFT A WIDOW AT EIGHTEEN SHE WAS FOR SOME TIME IN SEVASTOPOL AS A NURSE, AND HAD AFTERWARDS LIVED IN VARIOUS PLACES, AND NOW SHE TRAVELLED ABOUT SELLING THE GOSPEL.

‚ÄÚMAIS, MON DIEU, WASN‚ÄÔT IT YOU WHO HAD A STRANGE ADVENTURE IN OUR TOWN, A VERY STRANGE ADVENTURE?‚ÄÙ

SHE FLUSHED; IT TURNED OUT THAT IT HAD BEEN SHE.

‚ÄÚCES VAURIENS, CES MALHEUREUX,‚ÄÙ HE BEGAN IN A VOICE QUIVERING WITH INDIGNATION; MISERABLE AND HATEFUL RECOLLECTIONS STIRRED PAINFULLY IN HIS HEART. FOR A MINUTE HE SEEMED TO SINK INTO OBLIVION.

‚ÄÚBAH, BUT SHE‚ÄÔS GONE AWAY AGAIN,‚ÄÙ HE THOUGHT, WITH A START, NOTICING THAT SHE WAS NOT BY HIS SIDE. ‚ÄÚSHE KEEPS GOING OUT AND IS BUSY ABOUT SOMETHING; I NOTICE THAT SHE SEEMS UPSET TOO.‚Ä¶ BAH, JE DEVIENS EGOISTE!‚ÄÙ

HE RAISED HIS EYES AND SAW ANISIM AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME IN THE MOST MENACING SURROUNDINGS. THE WHOLE COTTAGE WAS FULL OF PEASANTS, AND IT WAS EVIDENTLY ANISIM WHO HAD BROUGHT THEM ALL IN. AMONG THEM WERE THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE, AND THE PEASANT WITH THE COW, TWO OTHER PEASANTS (THEY TURNED OUT TO BE CAB-DRIVERS), ANOTHER LITTLE MAN, HALF DRUNK, DRESSED LIKE A PEASANT BUT CLEAN-SHAVEN, WHO SEEMED LIKE A TOWNSMAN RUINED BY DRINK AND TALKED MORE THAN ANY OF THEM. AND THEY WERE ALL DISCUSSING HIM, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. THE PEASANT WITH THE COW INSISTED ON HIS POINT THAT TO GO ROUND BY THE LAKE WOULD BE THIRTY-FIVE MILES OUT OF THE WAY, AND THAT HE CERTAINLY MUST GO BY STEAMER. THE HALF-DRUNKEN MAN AND THE MAN OF THE HOUSE WARMLY RETORTED:

‚ÄÚSEEING THAT, THOUGH OF COURSE IT WILL BE NEARER FOR HIS HONOUR ON THE STEAMER OVER THE LAKE; THAT‚ÄÔS TRUE ENOUGH, BUT MAYBE ACCORDING TO PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS THE STEAMER DOESN‚ÄÔT GO THERE, BROTHER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT DOES GO, IT DOES, IT WILL GO FOR ANOTHER WEEK,‚ÄÙ CRIED ANISIM, MORE EXCITED THAN ANY OF THEM.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS TRUE ENOUGH, BUT IT DOESN‚ÄÔT ARRIVE PUNCTUALLY, SEEING IT‚ÄÔS LATE IN THE SEASON, AND SOMETIMES IT‚ÄÔLL STAY THREE DAYS TOGETHER AT USTYEVO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔLL BE THERE TO-MORROW AT TWO O‚ÄÔCLOCK PUNCTUALLY. YOU‚ÄÔLL BE AT SPASOV PUNCTUALLY BY THE EVENING,‚ÄÙ CRIED ANISIM, EAGER TO DO HIS BEST FOR STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.

‚ÄÚMAIS QU‚ÄÔEST-CE QU‚ÄÔIL A CET HOMME,‚ÄÙ THOUGHT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, TREMBLING AND WAITING IN TERROR FOR WHAT WAS IN STORE FOR HIM.

THE CAB-DRIVERS, TOO, CAME FORWARD AND BEGAN BARGAINING WITH HIM; THEY ASKED THREE ROUBLES TO USTYEVO. THE OTHERS SHOUTED THAT THAT WAS NOT TOO MUCH, THAT THAT WAS THE FARE, AND THAT THEY HAD BEEN DRIVING FROM HERE TO USTYEVO ALL THE SUMMER FOR THAT FARE.

‚ÄÚBUT ‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄÔS NICE HERE TOO.‚Ä¶ AND I DON‚ÄÔT WANT ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH MUMBLED IN PROTEST.

‚ÄÚNICE IT IS, SIR, YOU ARE RIGHT THERE, IT‚ÄÔS WONDERFULLY NICE AT SPASOV NOW AND FYODOR MATVEYEVITCH WILL BE SO PLEASED TO SEE YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMON DIEU, MES AMIS, ALL THIS IS SUCH A SURPRISE TO ME.‚ÄÙ

AT LAST SOFYA MATVEYEVNA CAME BACK. BUT SHE SAT DOWN ON THE BENCH LOOKING DEJECTED AND MOURNFUL.

‚ÄÚI CAN‚ÄÔT GET TO SPASOV!‚ÄÙ SHE SAID TO THE WOMAN OF THE COTTAGE.

‚ÄÚWHY, YOU ARE BOUND TO SPASOV, TOO, THEN?‚ÄÙ CRIED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, STARTING.

IT APPEARED THAT A LADY HAD THE DAY BEFORE TOLD HER TO WAIT AT HATOVO AND HAD PROMISED TO TAKE HER TO SPASOV, AND NOW THIS LADY HAD NOT TURNED UP AFTER ALL.

‚ÄÚWHAT AM I TO DO NOW?‚ÄÙ REPEATED SOFYA MATVEYEVNA.

‚ÄÚMAIS, MA CH√®RE ET NOUVELLE AMIE, I CAN TAKE YOU JUST AS WELL AS THE LADY TO THAT VILLAGE, WHATEVER IT IS, TO WHICH I‚ÄÔVE HIRED HORSES, AND TO-MORROW‚ÄÎWELL, TO-MORROW, WE‚ÄÔLL GO ON TOGETHER TO SPASOV.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, ARE YOU GOING TO SPASOV TOO?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMAIS QUE FAIRE, ET JE SUIS ENCHANT√©! I SHALL TAKE YOU WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE; YOU SEE THEY WANT TO TAKE ME, I‚ÄÔVE ENGAGED THEM ALREADY. WHICH OF YOU DID I ENGAGE?‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SUDDENLY FELT AN INTENSE DESIRE TO GO TO SPASOV.

WITHIN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THEY WERE GETTING INTO A COVERED TRAP, HE VERY LIVELY AND QUITE SATISFIED, SHE WITH HER PACK BESIDE HIM, WITH A GRATEFUL SMILE ON HER FACE. ANISIM HELPED THEM IN.

‚ÄÚA GOOD JOURNEY TO YOU, SIR,‚ÄÙ SAID HE, BUSTLING OFFICIOUSLY ROUND THE TRAP, ‚ÄÚIT HAS BEEN A TREAT TO SEE YOU.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚGOOD-BYE, GOOD-BYE, MY FRIEND, GOOD-BYE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔLL SEE FYODOR MATVEYEVITCH, SIR ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, MY FRIEND, YES ‚Ä¶ FYODOR PETROVITCH ‚Ä¶ ONLY GOOD-BYE.‚ÄÙ

II

‚ÄÚYOU SEE, MY FRIEND ‚Ä¶ YOU‚ÄÔLL ALLOW ME TO CALL MYSELF YOUR FRIEND, N‚ÄÔEST-CE PAS?‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH BEGAN HURRIEDLY AS SOON AS THE TRAP STARTED. ‚ÄÚYOU SEE I ‚Ä¶ J‚ÄÔAIME LE PEUPLE, C‚ÄÔEST INDISPENSABLE, MAIS IL ME SEMBLE QUE JE NE M‚ÄÔAVAIS JAMAIS VU DE PR√®S. STASIE ‚Ä¶ CELA VA SANS DIRE QU‚ÄÔELLE EST AUSSI DU PEUPLE, MAIS LE VRAI PEUPLE, THAT IS, THE REAL ONES, WHO ARE ON THE HIGH ROAD, IT SEEMS TO ME THEY CARE FOR NOTHING, BUT WHERE EXACTLY I AM GOING ‚Ä¶ BUT LET BYGONES BE BYGONES. I FANCY I AM TALKING AT RANDOM, BUT I BELIEVE IT‚ÄÔS FROM BEING FLUSTERED.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU DON‚ÄÔT SEEM QUITE WELL.‚ÄÙ SOFYA MATVEYEVNA WATCHED HIM KEENLY THOUGH RESPECTFULLY.

‚ÄÚNO, NO, I MUST ONLY WRAP MYSELF UP, BESIDES THERE‚ÄÔS A FRESH WIND, VERY FRESH IN FACT, BUT ‚Ä¶ LET US FORGET THAT. THAT‚ÄÔS NOT WHAT I REALLY MEANT TO SAY. CH√®RE ET INCOMPARABLE AMIE, I FEEL THAT I AM ALMOST HAPPY, AND IT‚ÄÔS YOUR DOING. HAPPINESS IS NOT GOOD FOR ME FOR IT MAKES ME RUSH TO FORGIVE ALL MY ENEMIES AT ONCE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHY, THAT‚ÄÔS A VERY GOOD THING, SIR.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNOT ALWAYS, CH√®RE INNOCENTE. L‚ÄÔEVANGILE ‚Ä¶ VOYEZ-VOUS, D√©SORMAIS NOUS PR√™CHERONS ENSEMBLE AND I WILL GLADLY SELL YOUR BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BOOKS. YES, I FEEL THAT THAT PERHAPS IS AN IDEA, QUELQUE CHOSE DE TR√®S NOUVEAU DANS CE GENRE. THE PEASANTS ARE RELIGIOUS, C‚ÄÔEST ADMIS, BUT THEY DON‚ÄÔT YET KNOW THE GOSPEL. I WILL EXPOUND IT TO THEM.‚Ä¶ BY VERBAL EXPLANATION ONE MIGHT CORRECT THE MISTAKES IN THAT REMARKABLE BOOK, WHICH I AM OF COURSE PREPARED TO TREAT WITH THE UTMOST RESPECT. I WILL BE OF SERVICE EVEN ON THE HIGH ROAD. I‚ÄÔVE ALWAYS BEEN OF USE, I ALWAYS TOLD THEM SO ET √† CETTE CH√®RE INGRATE.‚Ä¶ OH, WE WILL FORGIVE, WE WILL FORGIVE, FIRST OF ALL WE WILL FORGIVE ALL AND ALWAYS.‚Ä¶ WE WILL HOPE THAT WE TOO SHALL BE FORGIVEN. YES, FOR ALL, EVERY ONE OF US, HAVE WRONGED ONE ANOTHER, ALL ARE GUILTY!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS A VERY GOOD SAYING, I THINK, SIR.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYES, YES.‚Ä¶ I FEEL THAT I AM SPEAKING WELL. I SHALL SPEAK TO THEM VERY WELL, BUT WHAT WAS THE CHIEF THING I MEANT TO SAY? I KEEP LOSING THE THREAD AND FORGETTING.‚Ä¶ WILL YOU ALLOW ME TO REMAIN WITH YOU? I FEEL THAT THE LOOK IN YOUR EYES AND ‚Ä¶ I AM SURPRISED IN FACT AT YOUR MANNERS. YOU ARE SIMPLE-HEARTED, YOU CALL ME ‚ÄÒSIR,‚ÄÔ AND TURN YOUR CUP UPSIDE DOWN ON YOUR SAUCER ‚Ä¶ AND THAT HORRID LUMP OF SUGAR; BUT THERE‚ÄÔS SOMETHING CHARMING ABOUT YOU, AND I SEE FROM YOUR FEATURES.‚Ä¶ OH, DON‚ÄÔT BLUSH AND DON‚ÄÔT BE AFRAID OF ME AS A MAN. CH√®RE ET INCOMPARABLE, POUR MOI UNE FEMME C‚ÄÔEST TOUT. I CAN‚ÄÔT LIVE WITHOUT A WOMAN, BUT ONLY AT HER SIDE, ONLY AT HER SIDE ‚Ä¶ I AM AWFULLY MUDDLED, AWFULLY. I CAN‚ÄÔT REMEMBER WHAT I MEANT TO SAY. OH, BLESSED IS HE TO WHOM GOD ALWAYS SENDS A WOMAN AND ‚Ä¶ AND I FANCY, INDEED, THAT I AM IN A SORT OF ECSTASY. THERE‚ÄÔS A LOFTY IDEA IN THE OPEN ROAD TOO! THAT‚ÄÔS WHAT I MEANT TO SAY, THAT‚ÄÔS IT‚ÄÎABOUT THE IDEA. NOW I‚ÄÔVE REMEMBERED IT, BUT I KEPT LOSING IT BEFORE. AND WHY HAVE THEY TAKEN US FARTHER. IT WAS NICE THERE TOO, BUT HERE‚ÄÎCELA DEVIEN TROP FROID. A PROPOS, J‚ÄÔAI EN TOUT QUARANTE ROUBLES ET VOIL√† CET ARGENT, TAKE IT, TAKE IT, I CAN‚ÄÔT TAKE CARE OF IT, I SHALL LOSE IT OR IT WILL BE TAKEN AWAY FROM ME.‚Ä¶ I SEEM TO BE SLEEPY, I‚ÄÔVE A GIDDINESS IN MY HEAD. YES, I AM GIDDY, I AM GIDDY, I AM GIDDY. OH, HOW KIND YOU ARE, WHAT‚ÄÔS THAT YOU ARE WRAPPING ME UP IN?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU ARE CERTAINLY IN A REGULAR FEVER AND I‚ÄÔVE COVERED YOU WITH MY RUG; ONLY ABOUT THE MONEY, I‚ÄÔD RATHER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, FOR GOD‚ÄÔS SAKE, N‚ÄÔEN PARLONS PLUS PARCE QUE CELA ME FAIT MAL. OH, HOW KIND YOU ARE!‚ÄÙ

HE CEASED SPEAKING, AND WITH STRANGE SUDDENNESS DROPPED INTO A FEVERISH SHIVERY SLEEP. THE ROAD BY WHICH THEY DROVE THE TWELVE MILES WAS NOT A SMOOTH ONE, AND THEIR CARRIAGE JOLTED CRUELLY. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WOKE UP FREQUENTLY, QUICKLY RAISED HIS HEAD FROM THE LITTLE PILLOW WHICH SOFYA MATVEYEVNA HAD SLIPPED UNDER IT, CLUTCHED HER BY THE HAND AND ASKED ‚ÄÚARE YOU HERE?‚ÄÙ AS THOUGH HE WERE AFRAID SHE HAD LEFT HIM. HE TOLD HER, TOO, THAT HE HAD DREAMED OF GAPING JAWS FULL OF TEETH, AND THAT HE HAD VERY MUCH DISLIKED IT. SOFYA MATVEYEVNA WAS IN GREAT ANXIETY ABOUT HIM.

THEY WERE DRIVEN STRAIGHT UP TO A LARGE COTTAGE WITH A FRONTAGE OF FOUR WINDOWS AND OTHER ROOMS IN THE YARD. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAKED UP, HURRIEDLY WENT IN AND WALKED STRAIGHT INTO THE SECOND ROOM, WHICH WAS THE LARGEST AND BEST IN THE HOUSE. AN EXPRESSION OF FUSSINESS CAME INTO HIS SLEEPY FACE. HE SPOKE AT ONCE TO THE LANDLADY, A TALL, THICK-SET WOMAN OF FORTY WITH VERY DARK HAIR AND A SLIGHT MOUSTACHE, AND EXPLAINED THAT HE REQUIRED THE WHOLE ROOM FOR HIMSELF, AND THAT THE DOOR WAS TO BE SHUT AND NO ONE ELSE WAS TO BE ADMITTED, ‚ÄÚPARCE QUE NOUS AVONS √† PARLER. OUI, J‚ÄÔAI BEAUCOUP √† VOUS DIRE, CH√®RE AMIE. I‚ÄÔLL PAY YOU, I‚ÄÔLL PAY YOU,‚ÄÙ HE SAID WITH A WAVE OF DISMISSAL TO THE LANDLADY.

THOUGH HE WAS IN A HURRY, HE SEEMED TO ARTICULATE WITH DIFFICULTY. THE LANDLADY LISTENED GRIMLY, AND WAS SILENT IN TOKEN OF CONSENT, BUT THERE WAS A FEELING OF SOMETHING MENACING ABOUT HER SILENCE. HE DID NOT NOTICE THIS, AND HURRIEDLY (HE WAS IN A TERRIBLE HURRY) INSISTED ON HER GOING AWAY AND BRINGING THEM THEIR DINNER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, WITHOUT A MOMENT‚ÄÔS DELAY.

AT THAT POINT THE MOUSTACHED WOMAN COULD CONTAIN HERSELF NO LONGER.

‚ÄÚTHIS IS NOT AN INN, SIR; WE DON‚ÄÔT PROVIDE DINNERS FOR TRAVELLERS. WE CAN BOIL YOU SOME CRAYFISH OR SET THE SAMOVAR, BUT WE‚ÄÔVE NOTHING MORE. THERE WON‚ÄÔT BE FRESH FISH TILL TO-MORROW.‚ÄÙ

BUT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAVED HIS HANDS, REPEATING WITH WRATHFUL IMPATIENCE: ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔLL PAY, ONLY MAKE HASTE, MAKE HASTE.‚ÄÙ

THEY SETTLED ON FISH, SOUP, AND ROAST FOWL; THE LANDLADY DECLARED THAT FOWL WAS NOT TO BE PROCURED IN THE WHOLE VILLAGE; SHE AGREED, HOWEVER, TO GO IN SEARCH OF ONE, BUT WITH THE AIR OF DOING HIM AN IMMENSE FAVOUR.

AS SOON AS SHE HAD GONE STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH INSTANTLY SAT DOWN ON THE SOFA AND MADE SOFYA MATVEYEVNA SIT DOWN BESIDE HIM. THERE WERE SEVERAL ARM-CHAIRS AS WELL AS A SOFA IN THE ROOM, BUT THEY WERE OF A MOST UNINVITING APPEARANCE. THE ROOM WAS RATHER A LARGE ONE, WITH A CORNER, IN WHICH THERE WAS A BED, PARTITIONED OFF. IT WAS COVERED WITH OLD AND TATTERED YELLOW PAPER, AND HAD HORRIBLE LITHOGRAPHS OF MYTHOLOGICAL SUBJECTS ON THE WALLS; IN THE CORNER FACING THE DOOR THERE WAS A LONG ROW OF PAINTED IKONS AND SEVERAL SETS OF BRASS ONES. THE WHOLE ROOM WITH ITS STRANGELY ILL-ASSORTED FURNITURE WAS AN UNATTRACTIVE MIXTURE OF THE TOWN ELEMENT AND OF PEASANT TRADITIONS. BUT HE DID NOT EVEN GLANCE AT IT ALL, NOR LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE VAST LAKE, THE EDGE OF WHICH WAS ONLY SEVENTY FEET FROM THE COTTAGE.

‚ÄÚAT LAST WE ARE BY OURSELVES AND WE WILL ADMIT NO ONE! I WANT TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.‚ÄÙ

SOFYA MATVEYEVNA CHECKED HIM WITH GREAT UNEASINESS.

‚ÄÚARE YOU AWARE, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH?‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCOMMENT, VOUS SAVEZ D√©J√† MON NOM?‚ÄÙ HE SMILED WITH DELIGHT.

‚ÄÚI HEARD IT THIS MORNING FROM ANISIM IVANOVITCH WHEN YOU WERE TALKING TO HIM. BUT I VENTURE TO TELL YOU FOR MY PART ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

AND SHE WHISPERED HURRIEDLY TO HIM, LOOKING NERVOUSLY AT THE CLOSED DOOR FOR FEAR ANYONE SHOULD OVERHEAR‚ÄÎTHAT HERE IN THIS VILLAGE, IT WAS DREADFUL. THAT THOUGH ALL THE PEASANTS WERE FISHERMEN, THEY MADE THEIR LIVING CHIEFLY BY CHARGING TRAVELLERS EVERY SUMMER WHATEVER THEY THOUGHT FIT. THE VILLAGE WAS NOT ON THE HIGH ROAD BUT AN OUT-OF-THE-WAY ONE, AND PEOPLE ONLY CALLED THERE BECAUSE THE STEAMERS STOPPED THERE, AND THAT WHEN THE STEAMER DID NOT CALL‚ÄÎAND IF THE WEATHER WAS IN THE LEAST UNFAVOURABLE, IT WOULD NOT‚ÄÎTHEN NUMBERS OF TRAVELLERS WOULD BE WAITING THERE FOR SEVERAL DAYS, AND ALL THE COTTAGES IN THE VILLAGE WOULD BE OCCUPIED, AND THAT WAS JUST THE VILLAGERS‚ÄÔ OPPORTUNITY, FOR THEY CHARGED THREE TIMES ITS VALUE FOR EVERYTHING‚ÄÎAND THEIR LANDLORD HERE WAS PROUD AND STUCK UP BECAUSE HE WAS, FOR THESE PARTS, VERY RICH; HE HAD A NET WHICH HAD COST A THOUSAND ROUBLES.

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH LOOKED ALMOST REPROACHFULLY AT SOFYA MATVEYEVNA‚ÄÔS EXTREMELY EXCITED FACE, AND SEVERAL TIMES HE MADE A MOTION TO STOP HER. BUT SHE PERSISTED AND SAID ALL SHE HAD TO SAY: SHE SAID SHE HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE ALREADY IN THE SUMMER ‚ÄÚWITH A VERY GENTEEL LADY FROM THE TOWN,‚ÄÙ AND STAYED THERE TOO FOR TWO WHOLE DAYS TILL THE STEAMER CAME, AND WHAT THEY HAD TO PUT UP WITH DID NOT BEAR THINKING OF. ‚ÄÚHERE, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN PLEASED TO ASK FOR THIS ROOM FOR YOURSELF ALONE.‚Ä¶ I ONLY SPEAK TO WARN YOU.‚Ä¶ IN THE OTHER ROOM THERE ARE TRAVELLERS ALREADY. AN ELDERLY MAN AND A YOUNG MAN AND A LADY WITH CHILDREN, AND BY TO-MORROW BEFORE TWO O‚ÄÔCLOCK THE WHOLE HOUSE WILL BE FILLED UP, FOR SINCE THE STEAMER HASN‚ÄÔT BEEN HERE FOR TWO DAYS IT WILL BE SURE TO COME TO-MORROW. SO FOR A ROOM APART AND FOR ORDERING DINNER, AND FOR PUTTING OUT THE OTHER TRAVELLERS, THEY‚ÄÔLL CHARGE YOU A PRICE UNHEARD OF EVEN IN THE CAPITAL.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

BUT HE WAS IN DISTRESS, IN REAL DISTRESS. ‚ÄÚASSEZ, MON ENFANT, I BESEECH YOU, NOUS AVONS NOTRE ARGENT‚ÄÎET APR√®S, LE BON DIEU. AND I AM SURPRISED THAT, WITH THE LOFTINESS OF YOUR IDEAS, YOU ‚Ä¶ ASSEZ, ASSEZ, VOUS ME TOURMENTEZ,‚ÄÙ HE ARTICULATED HYSTERICALLY, ‚ÄÚWE HAVE ALL OUR FUTURE BEFORE US, AND YOU ‚Ä¶ YOU FILL ME WITH ALARM FOR THE FUTURE.‚ÄÙ

HE PROCEEDED AT ONCE TO UNFOLD HIS WHOLE STORY WITH SUCH HASTE THAT AT FIRST IT WAS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HIM. IT WENT ON FOR A LONG TIME. THE SOUP WAS SERVED, THE FOWL WAS BROUGHT IN, FOLLOWED AT LAST BY THE SAMOVAR, AND STILL HE TALKED ON. HE TOLD IT SOMEWHAT STRANGELY AND HYSTERICALLY, AND INDEED HE WAS ILL. IT WAS A SUDDEN, EXTREME EFFORT OF HIS INTELLECTUAL FACULTIES, WHICH WAS BOUND IN HIS OVERSTRAINED CONDITION, OF COURSE‚ÄÎSOFYA MATVEYEVNA FORESAW IT WITH DISTRESS ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING‚ÄÎTO RESULT IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS IN EXTREME EXHAUSTION. HE BEGAN HIS STORY ALMOST WITH HIS CHILDHOOD, WHEN, ‚ÄÚWITH FRESH HEART, HE RAN ABOUT THE MEADOWS; IT WAS AN HOUR BEFORE HE REACHED HIS TWO MARRIAGES AND HIS LIFE IN BERLIN. I DARE NOT LAUGH, HOWEVER. IT REALLY WAS FOR HIM A MATTER OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE, AND TO ADOPT THE MODERN JARGON, ALMOST A QUESTION OF STRUGGLING FOR EXISTENCE.‚ÄÙ HE SAW BEFORE HIM THE WOMAN WHOM HE HAD ALREADY ELECTED TO SHARE HIS NEW LIFE, AND WAS IN HASTE TO CONSECRATE HER, SO TO SPEAK. HIS GENIUS MUST NOT BE HIDDEN FROM HER.‚Ä¶ PERHAPS HE HAD FORMED A VERY EXAGGERATED ESTIMATE OF SOFYA MATVEYEVNA, BUT HE HAD ALREADY CHOSEN HER. HE COULD NOT EXIST WITHOUT A WOMAN. HE SAW CLEARLY FROM HER FACE THAT SHE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD HIM, AND COULD NOT GRASP EVEN THE MOST ESSENTIAL PART. ‚ÄÚCE N‚ÄÔEST RIEN, NOUS ATTENDRONS, AND MEANWHILE SHE CAN FEEL IT INTUITIVELY.‚Ä¶ MY FRIEND, I NEED NOTHING BUT YOUR HEART!‚ÄÙ HE EXCLAIMED, INTERRUPTING HIS NARRATIVE, ‚ÄÚAND THAT SWEET ENCHANTING LOOK WITH WHICH YOU ARE GAZING AT ME NOW. OH, DON‚ÄÔT BLUSH! I‚ÄÔVE TOLD YOU ALREADY ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ THE POOR WOMAN WHO HAD FALLEN INTO HIS HANDS FOUND MUCH THAT WAS OBSCURE, ESPECIALLY WHEN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY ALMOST PASSED INTO A COMPLETE DISSERTATION ON THE FACT THAT NO ONE HAD BEEN EVER ABLE TO UNDERSTAND STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, AND THAT ‚ÄÚMEN OF GENIUS ARE WASTED IN RUSSIA.‚ÄÙ IT WAS ALL ‚ÄÚSO VERY INTELLECTUAL,‚ÄÙ SHE REPORTED AFTERWARDS DEJECTEDLY. SHE LISTENED IN EVIDENT MISERY, RATHER ROUND-EYED. WHEN STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH FELL INTO A HUMOROUS VEIN AND THREW OFF WITTY SARCASMS AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR ADVANCED AND GOVERNING CLASSES, SHE TWICE MADE GRIEVOUS EFFORTS TO LAUGH IN RESPONSE TO HIS LAUGHTER, BUT THE RESULT WAS WORSE THAN TEARS, SO THAT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS AT LAST EMBARRASSED BY IT HIMSELF AND ATTACKED ‚ÄÚTHE NIHILISTS AND MODERN PEOPLE‚ÄÙ WITH ALL THE GREATER WRATH AND ZEST. AT THIS POINT HE SIMPLY ALARMED HER, AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE BEGAN UPON THE ROMANCE OF HIS LIFE THAT SHE FELT SOME SLIGHT RELIEF, THOUGH THAT TOO WAS DECEPTIVE. A WOMAN IS ALWAYS A WOMAN EVEN IF SHE IS A NUN. SHE SMILED, SHOOK HER HEAD AND THEN BLUSHED CRIMSON AND DROPPED HER EYES, WHICH ROUSED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH TO ABSOLUTE ECSTASY AND INSPIRATION SO MUCH THAT HE BEGAN FIBBING FREELY. VARVARA PETROVNA APPEARED IN HIS STORY AS AN ENCHANTING BRUNETTE (WHO HAD BEEN THE RAGE OF PETERSBURG AND MANY EUROPEAN CAPITALS) AND HER HUSBAND ‚ÄÚHAD BEEN STRUCK DOWN ON THE FIELD OF SEVASTOPOL‚ÄÙ SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD FELT UNWORTHY OF HER LOVE, AND HAD YIELDED HER TO HIS RIVAL, THAT IS, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.‚Ä¶ ‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT BE SHOCKED, MY GENTLE ONE, MY CHRISTIAN,‚ÄÙ HE EXCLAIMED TO SOFYA MATVEYEVNA, ALMOST BELIEVING HIMSELF IN ALL THAT HE WAS TELLING, ‚ÄÚIT WAS SOMETHING SO LOFTY, SO SUBTLE, THAT WE NEVER SPOKE OF IT TO ONE ANOTHER ALL OUR LIVES.‚ÄÙ AS THE STORY WENT ON, THE CAUSE OF THIS POSITION OF AFFAIRS APPEARED TO BE A BLONDE LADY (IF NOT DARYA PAVLOVNA I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW OF WHOM STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH COULD HAVE BEEN THINKING), THIS BLONDE OWED EVERYTHING TO THE BRUNETTE, AND HAD GROWN UP IN HER HOUSE, BEING A DISTANT RELATION. THE BRUNETTE OBSERVING AT LAST THE LOVE OF THE BLONDE GIRL TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, KEPT HER FEELINGS LOCKED UP IN HER HEART. THE BLONDE GIRL, NOTICING ON HER PART THE LOVE OF THE BRUNETTE TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, ALSO LOCKED HER FEELINGS IN HER OWN HEART. AND ALL THREE, PINING WITH MUTUAL MAGNANIMITY, KEPT SILENT IN THIS WAY FOR TWENTY YEARS, LOCKING THEIR FEELINGS IN THEIR HEARTS. ‚ÄÚOH, WHAT A PASSION THAT WAS, WHAT A PASSION THAT WAS!‚ÄÙ HE EXCLAIMED WITH A STIFLED SOB OF GENUINE ECSTASY. ‚ÄÚI SAW THE FULL BLOOMING OF HER BEAUTY‚ÄÙ (OF THE BRUNETTE‚ÄÔS, THAT IS), ‚ÄÚI SAW DAILY WITH AN ACHE IN MY HEART HOW SHE PASSED BY ME AS THOUGH ASHAMED SHE WAS SO FAIR‚ÄÙ (ONCE HE SAID ‚ÄÚASHAMED SHE WAS SO FAT‚ÄÙ). AT LAST HE HAD RUN AWAY, CASTING OFF ALL THIS FEVERISH DREAM OF TWENTY YEARS‚ÄÎVINGT ANS‚ÄÎAND NOW HERE HE WAS ON THE HIGH ROAD.‚Ä¶

THEN IN A SORT OF DELIRIUM BE BEGAN EXPLAINING TO SOFYA MATVEYEVNA THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THEIR MEETING THAT DAY, ‚ÄÚSO CHANCE AN ENCOUNTER AND SO FATEFUL FOR ALL ETERNITY.‚ÄÙ SOFYA MATVEYEVNA GOT UP FROM THE SOFA IN TERRIBLE CONFUSION AT LAST. HE HAD POSITIVELY MADE AN ATTEMPT TO DROP ON HIS KNEES BEFORE HER, WHICH MADE HER CRY. IT WAS BEGINNING TO GET DARK. THEY HAD BEEN FOR SOME HOURS SHUT UP IN THE ROOM.‚Ä¶

‚ÄÚNO, YOU‚ÄÔD BETTER LET ME GO INTO THE OTHER ROOM,‚ÄÙ SHE FALTERED, ‚ÄÚOR ELSE THERE‚ÄÔS NO KNOWING WHAT PEOPLE MAY THINK.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

SHE TORE HERSELF AWAY AT LAST; HE LET HER GO, PROMISING HER TO GO TO BED AT ONCE. AS THEY PARTED HE COMPLAINED THAT HE HAD A BAD HEADACHE. SOFYA MATVEYEVNA HAD ON ENTERING THE COTTAGE LEFT HER BAG AND THINGS IN THE FIRST ROOM, MEANING TO SPEND THE NIGHT WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE; BUT SHE GOT NO REST.

IN THE NIGHT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS ATTACKED BY THE MALADY WITH WHICH I AND ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE SO FAMILIAR‚ÄÎTHE SUMMER CHOLERA, WHICH WAS ALWAYS THE OUTCOME OF ANY NERVOUS STRAIN OR MORAL SHOCK WITH HIM. POOR SOFYA MATVEYEVNA DID NOT SLEEP ALL NIGHT. AS IN WAITING ON THE INVALID SHE WAS OBLIGED PRETTY OFTEN TO GO IN AND OUT OF THE COTTAGE THROUGH THE LANDLADY‚ÄÔS ROOM, THE LATTER, AS WELL AS THE TRAVELLERS WHO WERE SLEEPING THERE, GRUMBLED AND EVEN BEGAN SWEARING WHEN TOWARDS MORNING SHE SET ABOUT PREPARING THE SAMOVAR. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS HALF UNCONSCIOUS ALL THROUGH THE ATTACK; AT TIMES HE HAD A VISION OF THE SAMOVAR BEING SET, OF SOMEONE GIVING HIM SOMETHING TO DRINK (RASPBERRY TEA), AND PUTTING SOMETHING WARM TO HIS STOMACH AND HIS CHEST. BUT HE FELT ALMOST EVERY INSTANT THAT SHE WAS HERE, BESIDE HIM; THAT IT WAS SHE GOING OUT AND COMING IN, LIFTING HIM OFF THE BED AND SETTLING HIM IN IT AGAIN. TOWARDS THREE O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE MORNING HE BEGAN TO BE EASIER; HE SAT UP, PUT HIS LEGS OUT OF BED AND THINKING OF NOTHING HE FELL ON THE FLOOR AT HER FEET. THIS WAS A VERY DIFFERENT MATTER FROM THE KNEELING OF THE EVENING; HE SIMPLY BOWED DOWN AT HER FEET AND KISSED THE HEM OF HER DRESS.

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT, SIR, I AM NOT WORTH IT,‚ÄÙ SHE FALTERED, TRYING TO GET HIM BACK ON TO THE BED.

‚ÄÚMY SAVIOUR,‚ÄÙ HE CRIED, CLASPING HIS HANDS REVERENTLY BEFORE HER. ‚ÄÚVOUS √™TES NOBLE COMME UNE MARQUISE! I‚ÄÎI AM A WRETCH. OH, I‚ÄÔVE BEEN DISHONEST ALL MY LIFE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCALM YOURSELF!‚ÄÙ SOFYA MATVEYEVNA IMPLORED HIM.

‚ÄÚIT WAS ALL LIES THAT I TOLD YOU THIS EVENING‚ÄÎTO GLORIFY MYSELF, TO MAKE IT SPLENDID, FROM PURE WANTONNESS‚ÄÎALL, ALL, EVERY WORD, OH, I AM A WRETCH, I AM A WRETCH!‚ÄÙ

THE FIRST ATTACK WAS SUCCEEDED IN THIS WAY BY A SECOND‚ÄÎAN ATTACK OF HYSTERICAL REMORSE. I HAVE MENTIONED THESE ATTACKS ALREADY WHEN I DESCRIBED HIS LETTERS TO VARVARA PETROVNA. HE SUDDENLY RECALLED LISE AND THEIR MEETING THE PREVIOUS MORNING. ‚ÄÚIT WAS SO AWFUL, AND THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME DISASTER AND I DIDN‚ÄÔT ASK, DIDN‚ÄÔT FIND OUT! I THOUGHT ONLY OF MYSELF. OH, WHAT‚ÄÔS THE MATTER WITH HER? DO YOU KNOW WHAT‚ÄÔS THE MATTER WITH HER?‚ÄÙ HE BESOUGHT SOFYA MATVEYEVNA.

THEN HE SWORE THAT ‚ÄÚHE WOULD NEVER CHANGE,‚ÄÙ THAT HE WOULD GO BACK TO HER (THAT IS, VARVARA PETROVNA). ‚ÄÚWE‚ÄÙ (THAT IS, HE AND SOFYA MATVEYEVNA) ‚ÄÚWILL GO TO HER STEPS EVERY DAY WHEN SHE IS GETTING INTO HER CARRIAGE FOR HER MORNING DRIVE, AND WE WILL WATCH HER IN SECRET.‚Ä¶ OH, I WISH HER TO SMITE ME ON THE OTHER CHEEK; IT‚ÄÔS A JOY TO WISH IT! I SHALL TURN HER MY OTHER CHEEK COMME DANS VOTRE LIVRE! ONLY NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME I UNDERSTAND WHAT IS MEANT BY ‚Ä¶ TURNING THE OTHER CHEEK. I NEVER UNDERSTOOD BEFORE!‚ÄÙ

THE TWO DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WERE AMONG THE MOST TERRIBLE IN SOFYA MATVEYEVNA‚ÄÔS LIFE; SHE REMEMBERS THEM WITH A SHUDDER TO THIS DAY. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH BECAME SO SERIOUSLY ILL THAT HE COULD NOT GO ON BOARD THE STEAMER, WHICH ON THIS OCCASION ARRIVED PUNCTUALLY AT TWO O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON. SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO LEAVE HIM ALONE, SO SHE DID NOT LEAVE FOR SPASOV EITHER. FROM HER ACCOUNT HE WAS POSITIVELY DELIGHTED AT THE STEAMER‚ÄÔS GOING WITHOUT HIM.

‚ÄÚWELL, THAT‚ÄÔS A GOOD THING, THAT‚ÄÔS CAPITAL!‚ÄÙ HE MUTTERED IN HIS BED. ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE BEEN AFRAID ALL THE TIME THAT WE SHOULD GO. HERE IT‚ÄÔS SO NICE, BETTER THAN ANYWHERE.‚Ä¶ YOU WON‚ÄÔT LEAVE ME? OH, YOU HAVE NOT LEFT ME!‚ÄÙ

IT WAS BY NO MEANS SO NICE ‚ÄÚHERE‚ÄÙ, HOWEVER. HE DID NOT CARE TO HEAR OF HER DIFFICULTIES; HIS HEAD WAS FULL OF FANCIES AND NOTHING ELSE. HE LOOKED UPON HIS ILLNESS AS SOMETHING TRANSITORY, A TRIFLING AILMENT, AND DID NOT THINK ABOUT IT AT ALL; HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT HOW THEY WOULD GO AND SELL ‚ÄÚTHESE BOOKS.‚ÄÙ HE ASKED HER TO READ HIM THE GOSPEL.

‚ÄÚI HAVEN‚ÄÔT READ IT FOR A LONG TIME ‚Ä¶ IN THE ORIGINAL. SOME ONE MAY ASK ME ABOUT IT AND I SHALL MAKE A MISTAKE; I OUGHT TO PREPARE MYSELF AFTER ALL.‚ÄÙ

SHE SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM AND OPENED THE BOOK.

‚ÄÚYOU READ BEAUTIFULLY,‚ÄÙ HE INTERRUPTED HER AFTER THE FIRST LINE. ‚ÄÚI SEE, I SEE I WAS NOT MISTAKEN,‚ÄÙ HE ADDED OBSCURELY BUT ECSTATICALLY. HE WAS, IN FACT, IN A CONTINUAL STATE OF ENTHUSIASM. SHE READ THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT.

‚ÄÚASSEZ, ASSEZ, MON ENFANT, ENOUGH.‚Ä¶ DON‚ÄÔT YOU THINK THAT THAT IS ENOUGH?‚ÄÙ

AND HE CLOSED HIS EYES HELPLESSLY. HE WAS VERY WEAK, BUT HAD NOT YET LOST CONSCIOUSNESS. SOFYA MATVEYEVNA WAS GETTING UP, THINKING THAT HE WANTED TO SLEEP. BUT HE STOPPED HER.

‚ÄÚMY FRIEND, I‚ÄÔVE BEEN TELLING LIES ALL MY LIFE. EVEN WHEN I TOLD THE TRUTH I NEVER SPOKE FOR THE SAKE OF THE TRUTH, BUT ALWAYS FOR MY OWN SAKE. I KNEW IT BEFORE, BUT I ONLY SEE IT NOW.‚Ä¶ OH, WHERE ARE THOSE FRIENDS WHOM I HAVE INSULTED WITH MY FRIENDSHIP ALL MY LIFE? AND ALL, ALL! SAVEZ-VOUS ‚Ä¶ PERHAPS I AM TELLING LIES NOW; NO DOUBT I AM TELLING LIES NOW. THE WORST OF IT IS THAT I BELIEVE MYSELF WHEN I AM LYING. THE HARDEST THING IN LIFE IS TO LIVE WITHOUT TELLING LIES ‚Ä¶ AND WITHOUT BELIEVING IN ONE‚ÄÔS LIES. YES, YES, THAT‚ÄÔS JUST IT.‚Ä¶ BUT WAIT A BIT, THAT CAN ALL COME AFTERWARDS.‚Ä¶ WE‚ÄÔLL BE TOGETHER, TOGETHER,‚ÄÙ HE ADDED ENTHUSIASTICALLY.

‚ÄÚSTEPAN TROFIMOVITCH,‚ÄÙ SOFYA MATVEYEVNA ASKED TIMIDLY, ‚ÄÚHADN‚ÄÔT I BETTER SEND TO THE TOWN FOR THE DOCTOR?‚ÄÙ

HE WAS TREMENDOUSLY TAKEN ABACK.

‚ÄÚWHAT FOR? EST-CE QUE JE SUIS SI MALADE? MAIS RIEN DE S√©RIEUX. WHAT NEED HAVE WE OF OUTSIDERS? THEY MAY FIND, BESIDES‚ÄÎAND WHAT WILL HAPPEN THEN? NO, NO, NO OUTSIDERS AND WE‚ÄÔLL BE TOGETHER.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚDO YOU KNOW,‚ÄÙ HE SAID AFTER A PAUSE, ‚ÄÚREAD ME SOMETHING MORE, JUST THE FIRST THING YOU COME ACROSS.‚ÄÙ

SOFYA MATVEYEVNA OPENED THE TESTAMENT AND BEGAN READING.

‚ÄÚWHEREVER IT OPENS, WHEREVER IT HAPPENS TO OPEN,‚ÄÙ HE REPEATED.

‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒAND UNTO THE ANGEL OF THE CHURCH OF THE LAODICEANS ‚Ä¶‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWHAT‚ÄÔS THAT? WHAT IS IT? WHERE IS THAT FROM?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS FROM THE REVELATION.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, JE M‚ÄÔEN SOUVIENS, OUI, L‚ÄÔAPOCALYPSE. LISEZ, LISEZ, I AM TRYING OUR FUTURE FORTUNES BY THE BOOK. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAS TURNED UP. READ ON FROM THERE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒAND UNTO THE ANGEL OF THE CHURCH OF THE LAODICEANS WRITE: THESE THINGS SAITH THE AMEN, THE FAITHFUL AND TRUE WITNESS, THE BEGINNING OF THE CREATION OF GOD;

‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒI KNOW THY WORKS, THAT THOU ART NEITHER COLD NOR HOT; I WOULD THOU WERT COLD OR HOT.

‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒSO THEN BECAUSE THOU ART LUKEWARM, AND NEITHER COLD NOR HOT, I WILL SPUE THEE OUT OF MY MOUTH.

‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒBECAUSE THOU SAYEST, I AM RICH AND INCREASED WITH GOODS, AND HAVE NEED OF NOTHING: AND THOU KNOWEST NOT THAT THOU ART WRETCHED, AND MISERABLE, AND POOR, AND BLIND, AND NAKED.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHAT TOO ‚Ä¶ AND THAT‚ÄÔS IN YOUR BOOK TOO!‚ÄÙ HE EXCLAIMED, WITH FLASHING EYES AND RAISING HIS HEAD FROM THE PILLOW. ‚ÄÚI NEVER KNEW THAT GRAND PASSAGE! YOU HEAR, BETTER BE COLD, BETTER BE COLD THAN LUKEWARM, THAN ONLY LUKEWARM. OH, I‚ÄÔLL PROVE IT! ONLY DON‚ÄÔT LEAVE ME, DON‚ÄÔT LEAVE ME ALONE! WE‚ÄÔLL PROVE IT, WE‚ÄÔLL PROVE IT!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WON‚ÄÔT LEAVE YOU, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. I‚ÄÔLL NEVER LEAVE YOU!‚ÄÙ SHE TOOK HIS HAND, PRESSED IT IN BOTH OF HERS, AND LAID IT AGAINST HER HEART, LOOKING AT HIM WITH TEARS IN HER EYES. (‚ÄÚI FELT VERY SORRY FOR HIM AT THAT MOMENT,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID, DESCRIBING IT AFTERWARDS.)

HIS LIPS TWITCHED CONVULSIVELY.

‚ÄÚBUT, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, WHAT ARE WE TO DO THOUGH? OUGHTN‚ÄÔT WE TO LET SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS KNOW, OR PERHAPS YOUR RELATIONS?‚ÄÙ

BUT AT THAT HE WAS SO DISMAYED THAT SHE WAS VERY SORRY THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN OF IT AGAIN. TREMBLING AND SHAKING, HE BESOUGHT HER TO FETCH NO ONE, NOT TO DO ANYTHING. HE KEPT INSISTING, ‚ÄÚNO ONE, NO ONE! WE‚ÄÔLL BE ALONE, BY OURSELVES, ALONE, NOUS PARTIRONS ENSEMBLE.‚ÄÙ

ANOTHER DIFFICULTY WAS THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE TOO BEGAN TO BE UNEASY; THEY GRUMBLED, AND KEPT PESTERING SOFYA MATVEYEVNA. SHE PAID THEM AND MANAGED TO LET THEM SEE HER MONEY. THIS SOFTENED THEM FOR THE TIME, BUT THE MAN INSISTED ON SEEING STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH‚ÄÔS ‚ÄÚPAPERS.‚ÄÙ THE INVALID POINTED WITH A SUPERCILIOUS SMILE TO HIS LITTLE BAG. SOFYA MATVEYEVNA FOUND IN IT THE CERTIFICATE OF HIS HAVING RESIGNED HIS POST AT THE UNIVERSITY, OR SOMETHING OF THE KIND, WHICH HAD SERVED HIM AS A PASSPORT ALL HIS LIFE. THE MAN PERSISTED, AND SAID THAT ‚ÄÚHE MUST BE TAKEN SOMEWHERE, BECAUSE THEIR HOUSE WASN‚ÄÔT A HOSPITAL, AND IF HE WERE TO DIE THERE MIGHT BE A BOTHER. WE SHOULD HAVE NO END OF TROUBLE.‚ÄÙ SOFYA MATVEYEVNA TRIED TO SPEAK TO HIM OF THE DOCTOR, BUT IT APPEARED THAT SENDING TO THE TOWN WOULD COST SO MUCH THAT SHE HAD TO GIVE UP ALL IDEA OF THE DOCTOR. SHE RETURNED IN DISTRESS TO HER INVALID. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS GETTING WEAKER AND WEAKER.

‚ÄÚNOW READ ME ANOTHER PASSAGE.‚Ä¶ ABOUT THE PIGS,‚ÄÙ HE SAID SUDDENLY.

‚ÄÚWHAT?‚ÄÙ ASKED SOFYA MATVEYEVNA, VERY MUCH ALARMED.

‚ÄÚABOUT THE PIGS ‚Ä¶ THAT‚ÄÔS THERE TOO ‚Ä¶ CES COCHONS. I REMEMBER THE DEVILS ENTERED INTO SWINE AND THEY ALL WERE DROWNED. YOU MUST READ ME THAT; I‚ÄÔLL TELL YOU WHY AFTERWARDS. I WANT TO REMEMBER IT WORD FOR WORD. I WANT IT WORD FOR WORD.‚ÄÙ

SOFYA MATVEYEVNA KNEW THE GOSPEL WELL AND AT ONCE FOUND THE PASSAGE IN ST. LUKE WHICH I HAVE CHOSEN AS THE MOTTO OF MY RECORD. I QUOTE IT HERE AGAIN:

‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒAND THERE WAS THERE ONE HERD OF MANY SWINE FEEDING ON THE MOUNTAIN; AND THEY BESOUGHT HIM THAT HE WOULD SUFFER THEM TO ENTER INTO THEM. AND HE SUFFERED THEM.

‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒTHEN WENT THE DEVILS OUT OF THE MAN AND ENTERED INTO THE SWINE; AND THE HERD RAN VIOLENTLY DOWN A STEEP PLACE INTO THE LAKE, AND WERE CHOKED.

‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒWHEN THEY THAT FED THEM SAW WHAT WAS DONE, THEY FLED, AND WENT AND TOLD IT IN THE CITY AND IN THE COUNTRY.

‚ÄÚ‚ÄÒTHEN THEY WENT OUT TO SEE WHAT WAS DONE; AND CAME TO JESUS AND FOUND THE MAN, OUT OF WHOM THE DEVILS WERE DEPARTED, SITTING AT THE FEET OF JESUS, CLOTHED, AND IN HIS RIGHT MIND; AND THEY WERE AFRAID.‚ÄÔ‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMY FRIEND,‚ÄÙ SAID STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH IN GREAT EXCITEMENT ‚ÄÚSAVEZ-VOUS, THAT WONDERFUL AND ‚Ä¶ EXTRAORDINARY PASSAGE HAS BEEN A STUMBLING-BLOCK TO ME ALL MY LIFE ‚Ä¶ DANS CE LIVRE.‚Ä¶ SO MUCH SO THAT I REMEMBERED THOSE VERSES FROM CHILDHOOD. NOW AN IDEA HAS OCCURRED TO ME; UNE COMPARAISON. A GREAT NUMBER OF IDEAS KEEP COMING INTO MY MIND NOW. YOU SEE, THAT‚ÄÔS EXACTLY LIKE OUR RUSSIA, THOSE DEVILS THAT COME OUT OF THE SICK MAN AND ENTER INTO THE SWINE. THEY ARE ALL THE SORES, ALL THE FOUL CONTAGIONS, ALL THE IMPURITIES, ALL THE DEVILS GREAT AND SMALL THAT HAVE MULTIPLIED IN THAT GREAT INVALID, OUR BELOVED RUSSIA, IN THE COURSE OF AGES AND AGES. OUI, CETTE RUSSIE QUE J‚ÄÔAIMAIS TOUJOURS. BUT A GREAT IDEA AND A GREAT WILL WILL ENCOMPASS IT FROM ON HIGH, AS WITH THAT LUNATIC POSSESSED OF DEVILS ‚Ä¶ AND ALL THOSE DEVILS WILL COME FORTH, ALL THE IMPURITY, ALL THE ROTTENNESS THAT WAS PUTREFYING ON THE SURFACE ‚Ä¶ AND THEY WILL BEG OF THEMSELVES TO ENTER INTO SWINE; AND INDEED MAYBE THEY HAVE ENTERED INTO THEM ALREADY! THEY ARE WE, WE AND THOSE ‚Ä¶ AND PETRUSHA AND LES AUTRES AVEC LUI ‚Ä¶ AND I PERHAPS AT THE HEAD OF THEM, AND WE SHALL CAST OURSELVES DOWN, POSSESSED AND RAVING, FROM THE ROCKS INTO THE SEA, AND WE SHALL ALL BE DROWNED‚ÄÎAND A GOOD THING TOO, FOR THAT IS ALL WE ARE FIT FOR. BUT THE SICK MAN WILL BE HEALED AND ‚ÄÒWILL SIT AT THE FEET OF JESUS,‚ÄÔ AND ALL WILL LOOK UPON HIM WITH ASTONISHMENT.‚Ä¶ MY DEAR, VOUS COMPRENDREZ APR√®S, BUT NOW IT EXCITES ME VERY MUCH.‚Ä¶ VOUS COMPRENDREZ APR√®S. NOUS COMPRENDRONS ENSEMBLE.‚ÄÙ

HE SANK INTO DELIRIUM AND AT LAST LOST CONSCIOUSNESS. SO IT WENT ON ALL THE FOLLOWING DAY. SOFYA MATVEYEVNA SAT BESIDE HIM, CRYING. SHE SCARCELY SLEPT AT ALL FOR THREE NIGHTS, AND AVOIDED SEEING THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE, WHO WERE, SHE FELT, BEGINNING TO TAKE SOME STEPS. DELIVERANCE ONLY CAME ON THE THIRD DAY. IN THE MORNING STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH RETURNED TO CONSCIOUSNESS, RECOGNISED HER, AND HELD OUT HIS HAND TO HER. SHE CROSSED HERSELF HOPEFULLY. HE WANTED TO LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW. ‚ÄÚTIENS, UN LAC!‚ÄÙ HE SAID. ‚ÄÚGOOD HEAVENS, I HAD NOT SEEN IT BEFORE!‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ AT THAT MOMENT THERE WAS THE RUMBLE OF A CARRIAGE AT THE COTTAGE DOOR AND A GREAT HUBBUB IN THE HOUSE FOLLOWED.

III

IT WAS VARVARA PETROVNA HERSELF. SHE HAD ARRIVED, WITH DARYA PAVLOVNA, IN A CLOSED CARRIAGE DRAWN BY FOUR HORSES, WITH TWO FOOTMEN. THE MARVEL HAD HAPPENED IN THE SIMPLEST WAY: ANISIM, DYING OF CURIOSITY, WENT TO VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS THE DAY AFTER HE REACHED THE TOWN AND GOSSIPED TO THE SERVANTS, TELLING THEM HE HAD MET STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH ALONE IN A VILLAGE, THAT THE LATTER HAD BEEN SEEN BY PEASANTS WALKING BY HIMSELF ON THE HIGH ROAD, AND THAT HE HAD SET OFF FOR SPASOV BY WAY OF USTYEVO ACCOMPANIED BY SOFYA MATVEYEVNA. AS VARVARA PETROVNA WAS, FOR HER PART, IN TERRIBLE ANXIETY AND HAD DONE EVERYTHING SHE COULD TO FIND HER FUGITIVE FRIEND, SHE WAS AT ONCE TOLD ABOUT ANISIM. WHEN SHE HAD HEARD HIS STORY, ESPECIALLY THE DETAILS OF THE DEPARTURE FOR USTYEVO IN A CART IN THE COMPANY OF SOME SOFYA MATVEYEVNA, SHE INSTANTLY GOT READY AND SET OFF POST-HASTE FOR USTYEVO HERSELF.

HER STERN AND PEREMPTORY VOICE RESOUNDED THROUGH THE COTTAGE; EVEN THE LANDLORD AND HIS WIFE WERE INTIMIDATED. SHE HAD ONLY STOPPED TO QUESTION THEM AND MAKE INQUIRIES, BEING PERSUADED THAT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH MUST HAVE REACHED SPASOV LONG BEFORE. LEARNING THAT HE WAS STILL HERE AND ILL, SHE ENTERED THE COTTAGE IN GREAT AGITATION.

‚ÄÚWELL, WHERE IS HE? AH, THAT‚ÄÔS YOU!‚ÄÙ SHE CRIED, SEEING SOFYA MATVEYEVNA, WHO APPEARED AT THAT VERY INSTANT IN THE DOORWAY OF THE NEXT ROOM. ‚ÄÚI CAN GUESS FROM YOUR SHAMELESS FACE THAT IT‚ÄÔS YOU. GO AWAY, YOU VILE HUSSY! DON‚ÄÔT LET ME FIND A TRACE OF HER IN THE HOUSE! TURN HER OUT, OR ELSE, MY GIRL, I‚ÄÔLL GET YOU LOCKED UP FOR GOOD. KEEP HER SAFE FOR A TIME IN ANOTHER HOUSE. SHE‚ÄÔS BEEN IN PRISON ONCE ALREADY IN THE TOWN; SHE CAN GO BACK THERE AGAIN. AND YOU, MY GOOD MAN, DON‚ÄÔT DARE TO LET ANYONE IN WHILE I AM HERE, I BEG OF YOU. I AM MADAME STAVROGIN, AND I‚ÄÔLL TAKE THE WHOLE HOUSE. AS FOR YOU, MY DEAR, YOU‚ÄÔLL HAVE TO GIVE ME A FULL ACCOUNT OF IT ALL.‚ÄÙ

THE FAMILIAR SOUNDS OVERWHELMED STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH. HE BEGAN TO TREMBLE. BUT SHE HAD ALREADY STEPPED BEHIND THE SCREEN. WITH FLASHING EYES SHE DREW UP A CHAIR WITH HER FOOT, AND, SINKING BACK IN IT, SHE SHOUTED TO DASHA:

‚ÄÚGO AWAY FOR A TIME! STAY IN THE OTHER ROOM. WHY ARE YOU SO INQUISITIVE? AND SHUT THE DOOR PROPERLY AFTER YOU.‚ÄÙ

FOR SOME TIME SHE GAZED IN SILENCE WITH A SORT OF PREDATORY LOOK INTO HIS FRIGHTENED FACE.

‚ÄÚWELL, HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH? SO YOU‚ÄÔVE BEEN ENJOYING YOURSELF?‚ÄÙ BROKE FROM HER WITH FEROCIOUS IRONY.

‚ÄÚCH√®RE,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH FALTERED, NOT KNOWING WHAT HE WAS SAYING, ‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE LEARNT TO KNOW REAL LIFE IN RUSSIA ‚Ä¶ ET JE PR√™CHERAI L‚ÄÔEVANGILE.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚOH, SHAMELESS, UNGRATEFUL MAN!‚ÄÙ SHE WAILED SUDDENLY, CLASPING HER HANDS. ‚ÄÚAS THOUGH YOU HAD NOT DISGRACED ME ENOUGH, YOU‚ÄÔVE TAKEN UP WITH ‚Ä¶ OH, YOU SHAMELESS OLD REPROBATE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCH√®RE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HIS VOICE FAILED HIM AND HE COULD NOT ARTICULATE A SYLLABLE BUT SIMPLY GAZED WITH EYES WIDE WITH HORROR.

‚ÄÚWHO IS SHE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚC‚ÄÔEST UN ANGE; C‚ÄÔ√©TAIT PLUS QU‚ÄÔUN ANGE POUR MOI. SHE‚ÄÔS BEEN ALL NIGHT ‚Ä¶ OH, DON‚ÄÔT SHOUT, DON‚ÄÔT FRIGHTEN HER, CH√®RE, CH√®RE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

WITH A LOUD NOISE, VARVARA PETROVNA PUSHED BACK HER CHAIR, UTTERING A LOUD CRY OF ALARM.

‚ÄÚWATER, WATER!‚ÄÙ

THOUGH HE RETURNED TO CONSCIOUSNESS, SHE WAS STILL SHAKING WITH TERROR, AND, WITH PALE CHEEKS, LOOKED AT HIS DISTORTED FACE. IT WAS ONLY THEN, FOR THE FIRST TIME, THAT SHE GUESSED THE SERIOUSNESS OF HIS ILLNESS.

‚ÄÚDARYA,‚ÄÙ SHE WHISPERED SUDDENLY TO DARYA PAVLOVNA, ‚ÄÚSEND AT ONCE FOR THE DOCTOR, FOR SALZFISH; LET YEGORYTCH GO AT ONCE. LET HIM HIRE HORSES HERE AND GET ANOTHER CARRIAGE FROM THE TOWN. HE MUST BE HERE BY NIGHT.‚ÄÙ

DASHA FLEW TO DO HER BIDDING. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH STILL GAZED AT HER WITH THE SAME WIDE-OPEN, FRIGHTENED EYES; HIS BLANCHED LIPS QUIVERED.

‚ÄÚWAIT A BIT, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, WAIT A BIT, MY DEAR!‚ÄÙ SHE SAID, COAXING HIM LIKE A CHILD. ‚ÄÚTHERE, THERE, WAIT A BIT! DARYA WILL COME BACK AND ‚Ä¶ MY GOODNESS, THE LANDLADY, THE LANDLADY, YOU COME, ANYWAY, MY GOOD WOMAN!‚ÄÙ

IN HER IMPATIENCE SHE RAN HERSELF TO THE LANDLADY.

‚ÄÚFETCH THAT WOMAN BACK AT ONCE, THIS MINUTE. BRING HER BACK, BRING HER BACK!‚ÄÙ

FORTUNATELY SOFYA MATVEYEVNA HAD NOT YET HAD TIME TO GET AWAY AND WAS ONLY JUST GOING OUT OF THE GATE WITH HER PACK AND HER BAG. SHE WAS BROUGHT BACK. SHE WAS SO PANIC-STRICKEN THAT SHE WAS TREMBLING IN EVERY LIMB. VARVARA PETROVNA POUNCED ON HER LIKE A HAWK ON A CHICKEN, SEIZED HER BY THE HAND AND DRAGGED HER IMPULSIVELY TO STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH.

‚ÄÚHERE, HERE SHE IS, THEN. I‚ÄÔVE NOT EATEN HER. YOU THOUGHT I‚ÄÔD EATEN HER.‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH CLUTCHED VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS HAND, RAISED IT TO HIS EYES, AND BURST INTO TEARS, SOBBING VIOLENTLY AND CONVULSIVELY.

‚ÄÚTHERE, CALM YOURSELF, THERE, THERE, MY DEAR, THERE, POOR DEAR MAN! ACH, MERCY ON US! CALM YOURSELF, WILL YOU?‚ÄÙ SHE SHOUTED FRANTICALLY. ‚ÄÚOH, YOU BANE OF MY LIFE!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMY DEAR,‚ÄÙ STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH MURMURED AT LAST, ADDRESSING SOFYA MATVEYEVNA, ‚ÄÚSTAY OUT THERE, MY DEAR, I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING HERE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

SOFYA MATVEYEVNA HURRIED OUT AT ONCE.

‚ÄÚCH√©RIE ‚Ä¶ CH√©RIE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ HE GASPED.

‚ÄÚDON‚ÄÔT TALK FOR A BIT, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, WAIT A LITTLE TILL YOU‚ÄÔVE RESTED. HERE‚ÄÔS SOME WATER. DO WAIT, WILL YOU!‚ÄÙ

SHE SAT DOWN ON THE CHAIR AGAIN. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HELD HER HAND TIGHT. FOR A LONG WHILE SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO SPEAK. HE RAISED HER HAND TO HIS LIPS AND FELL TO KISSING IT. SHE SET HER TEETH AND LOOKED AWAY INTO THE CORNER OF THE ROOM.

‚ÄÚJE VOUS AIMAIS,‚ÄÙ BROKE FROM HIM AT LAST. SHE HAD NEVER HEARD SUCH WORDS FROM HIM, UTTERED IN SUCH A VOICE.

‚ÄÚH‚ÄÔM!‚ÄÙ SHE GROWLED IN RESPONSE.

‚ÄÚJE VOUS AIMAIS TOUTE MA VIE ‚Ä¶ VINGT ANS!‚ÄÙ

SHE REMAINED SILENT FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES.

‚ÄÚAND WHEN YOU WERE GETTING YOURSELF UP FOR DASHA YOU SPRINKLED YOURSELF WITH SCENT,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID SUDDENLY, IN A TERRIBLE WHISPER.

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH WAS DUMBFOUNDED.

‚ÄÚYOU PUT ON A NEW TIE ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

AGAIN SILENCE FOR TWO MINUTES.

‚ÄÚDO YOU REMEMBER THE CIGAR?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚMY FRIEND,‚ÄÙ HE FALTERED, OVERCOME WITH HORROR.

‚ÄÚTHAT CIGAR AT THE WINDOW IN THE EVENING ‚Ä¶ THE MOON WAS SHINING ‚Ä¶ AFTER THE ARBOUR ‚Ä¶ AT SKVORESHNIKI? DO YOU REMEMBER, DO YOU REMEMBER?‚ÄÙ SHE JUMPED UP FROM HER PLACE, SEIZED HIS PILLOW BY THE CORNERS AND SHOOK IT WITH HIS HEAD ON IT. ‚ÄÚDO YOU REMEMBER, YOU WORTHLESS, WORTHLESS, IGNOBLE, COWARDLY, WORTHLESS MAN, ALWAYS WORTHLESS!‚ÄÙ SHE HISSED IN HER FURIOUS WHISPER, RESTRAINING HERSELF FROM SPEAKING LOUDLY. AT LAST SHE LEFT HIM AND SANK ON THE CHAIR, COVERING HER FACE WITH HER HANDS. ‚ÄÚENOUGH!‚ÄÙ SHE SNAPPED OUT, DRAWING HERSELF UP. ‚ÄÚTWENTY YEARS HAVE PASSED, THERE‚ÄÔS NO CALLING THEM BACK. I AM A FOOL TOO.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚJE VOUS AIMAIS.‚ÄÙ HE CLASPED HIS HANDS AGAIN.

‚ÄÚWHY DO YOU KEEP ON WITH YOUR AIMAIS AND AIMAIS? ENOUGH!‚ÄÙ SHE CRIED, LEAPING UP AGAIN. ‚ÄÚAND IF YOU DON‚ÄÔT GO TO SLEEP AT ONCE I‚ÄÔLL ‚Ä¶ YOU NEED REST; GO TO SLEEP, GO TO SLEEP AT ONCE, SHUT YOUR EYES. ACH, MERCY ON US, PERHAPS HE WANTS SOME LUNCH! WHAT DO YOU EAT? WHAT DOES HE EAT? ACH, MERCY ON US! WHERE IS THAT WOMAN? WHERE IS SHE?‚ÄÙ

THERE WAS A GENERAL BUSTLE AGAIN. BUT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH FALTERED IN A WEAK VOICE THAT HE REALLY WOULD LIKE TO GO TO SLEEP UNE HEURE, AND THEN UN BOUILLON, UN TH√©.‚Ä¶ ENFIN IL EST SI HEUREUX. HE LAY BACK AND REALLY DID SEEM TO GO TO SLEEP (HE PROBABLY PRETENDED TO). VARVARA PETROVNA WAITED A LITTLE, AND STOLE OUT ON TIPTOE FROM BEHIND THE PARTITION.

SHE SETTLED HERSELF IN THE LANDLADY‚ÄÔS ROOM, TURNED OUT THE LANDLADY AND HER HUSBAND, AND TOLD DASHA TO BRING HER THAT WOMAN. THERE FOLLOWED AN EXAMINATION IN EARNEST.

‚ÄÚTELL ME ALL ABOUT IT, MY GOOD GIRL. SIT DOWN BESIDE ME; THAT‚ÄÔS RIGHT. WELL?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI MET STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSTAY, HOLD YOUR TONGUE! I WARN YOU THAT IF YOU TELL LIES OR CONCEAL ANYTHING, I‚ÄÔLL FERRET IT OUT. WELL?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSTEPAN TROFIMOVITCH AND I ‚Ä¶ AS SOON AS I CAME TO HATOVO ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ SOFYA MATVEYEVNA BEGAN ALMOST BREATHLESSLY.

‚ÄÚSTAY, HOLD YOUR TONGUE, WAIT A BIT! WHY DO YOU GABBLE LIKE THAT? TO BEGIN WITH, WHAT SORT OF CREATURE ARE YOU?‚ÄÙ

SOFYA MATVEYEVNA TOLD HER AFTER A FASHION, GIVING A VERY BRIEF ACCOUNT OF HERSELF, HOWEVER, BEGINNING WITH SEVASTOPOL. VARVARA PETROVNA LISTENED IN SILENCE, SITTING UP ERECT IN HER CHAIR, LOOKING STERNLY STRAIGHT INTO THE SPEAKER‚ÄÔS EYES.

‚ÄÚWHY ARE YOU SO FRIGHTENED? WHY DO YOU LOOK AT THE GROUND? I LIKE PEOPLE WHO LOOK ME STRAIGHT IN THE FACE AND HOLD THEIR OWN WITH ME. GO ON.‚ÄÙ

SHE TOLD OF THEIR MEETING, OF HER BOOKS, OF HOW STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HAD REGALED THE PEASANT WOMAN WITH VODKA ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS RIGHT, THAT‚ÄÔS RIGHT, DON‚ÄÔT LEAVE OUT THE SLIGHTEST DETAIL,‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA ENCOURAGED HER.

AT LAST SHE DESCRIBED HOW THEY HAD SET OFF, AND HOW STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH HAD GONE ON TALKING, ‚ÄÚREALLY ILL BY THAT TIME,‚ÄÙ AND HERE HAD GIVEN AN ACCOUNT OF HIS LIFE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, TALKING FOR SOME HOURS. ‚ÄÚTELL ME ABOUT HIS LIFE.‚ÄÙ

SOFYA MATVEYEVNA SUDDENLY STOPPED AND WAS COMPLETELY NONPLUSSED.

‚ÄÚI CAN‚ÄÔT TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT THAT, MADAM,‚ÄÙ SHE BROUGHT OUT, ALMOST CRYING; ‚ÄÚBESIDES, I COULD HARDLY UNDERSTAND A WORD OF IT.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNONSENSE! YOU MUST HAVE UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHE TOLD A LONG TIME ABOUT A DISTINGUISHED LADY WITH BLACK HAIR.‚ÄÙ SOFYA MATVEYEVNA FLUSHED TERRIBLY THOUGH SHE NOTICED VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS FAIR HAIR AND HER COMPLETE DISSIMILARITY WITH THE ‚ÄÚBRUNETTE‚ÄÙ OF THE STORY.

‚ÄÚBLACK-HAIRED? WHAT EXACTLY? COME, SPEAK!‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW THIS GRAND LADY WAS DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH HIS HONOUR ALL HER LIFE LONG AND FOR TWENTY YEARS, BUT NEVER DARED TO SPEAK, AND WAS SHAMEFACED BEFORE HIM BECAUSE SHE WAS A VERY STOUT LADY.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHE FOOL!‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA RAPPED OUT THOUGHTFULLY BUT RESOLUTELY.

SOFYA MATVEYEVNA WAS IN TEARS BY NOW.

‚ÄÚI DON‚ÄÔT KNOW HOW TO TELL ANY OF IT PROPERLY, MADAM, BECAUSE I WAS IN A GREAT FRIGHT OVER HIS HONOUR; AND I COULDN‚ÄÔT UNDERSTAND, AS HE IS SUCH AN INTELLECTUAL GENTLEMAN.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS NOT FOR A GOOSE LIKE YOU TO JUDGE OF HIS INTELLECT. DID HE OFFER YOU HIS HAND?‚ÄÙ

THE SPEAKER TREMBLED.

‚ÄÚDID HE FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU? SPEAK! DID HE OFFER YOU HIS HAND?‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA SHOUTED PEREMPTORILY.

‚ÄÚTHAT WAS PRETTY MUCH HOW IT WAS,‚ÄÙ SHE MURMURED TEARFULLY. ‚ÄÚBUT I TOOK IT ALL TO MEAN NOTHING, BECAUSE OF HIS ILLNESS,‚ÄÙ SHE ADDED FIRMLY, RAISING HER EYES.

‚ÄÚWHAT IS YOUR NAME?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚSOFYA MATVEYEVNA, MADAM.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚWELL, THEN, LET ME TELL YOU, SOFYA MATVEYEVNA, THAT HE IS A WRETCHED AND WORTHLESS LITTLE MAN.‚Ä¶ GOOD LORD! DO YOU LOOK UPON ME AS A WICKED WOMAN?‚ÄÙ

SOFYA MATVEYEVNA GAZED OPEN-EYED.

‚ÄÚA WICKED WOMAN, A TYRANT? WHO HAS RUINED HIS LIFE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚHOW CAN THAT BE WHEN YOU ARE CRYING YOURSELF, MADAM?‚ÄÙ

VARVARA PETROVNA ACTUALLY HAD TEARS IN HER EYES.

‚ÄÚWELL, SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN, DON‚ÄÔT BE FRIGHTENED. LOOK ME STRAIGHT IN THE FACE AGAIN. WHY ARE YOU BLUSHING? DASHA, COME HERE. LOOK AT HER. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER? HER HEART IS PURE.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

AND TO THE AMAZEMENT AND PERHAPS STILL GREATER ALARM OF SOFYA MATVEYEVNA, SHE SUDDENLY PATTED HER ON THE CHEEK.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS ONLY A PITY SHE IS A FOOL. TOO GREAT A FOOL FOR HER AGE. THAT‚ÄÔS ALL RIGHT, MY DEAR, I‚ÄÔLL LOOK AFTER YOU. I SEE THAT IT‚ÄÔS ALL NONSENSE. STAY NEAR HERE FOR THE TIME. A ROOM SHALL BE TAKEN FOR YOU AND YOU SHALL HAVE FOOD AND EVERYTHING ELSE FROM ME ‚Ä¶ TILL I ASK FOR YOU.‚ÄÙ

SOFYA MATVEYEVNA STAMMERED IN ALARM THAT SHE MUST HURRY ON.

‚ÄÚYOU‚ÄÔVE NO NEED TO HURRY. I‚ÄÔLL BUY ALL YOUR BOOKS, AND MEANTIME YOU STAY HERE. HOLD YOUR TONGUE; DON‚ÄÔT MAKE EXCUSES. IF I HADN‚ÄÔT COME YOU WOULD HAVE STAYED WITH HIM ALL THE SAME, WOULDN‚ÄÔT YOU?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI WOULDN‚ÄÔT HAVE LEFT HIM ON ANY ACCOUNT,‚ÄÙ SOFYA MATVEYEVNA BROUGHT OUT SOFTLY AND FIRMLY, WIPING HER TEARS.

IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT WHEN DOCTOR SALZFISH WAS BROUGHT. HE WAS A VERY RESPECTABLE OLD MAN AND A PRACTITIONER OF FAIRLY WIDE EXPERIENCE WHO HAD RECENTLY LOST HIS POST IN THE SERVICE IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME QUARREL ON A POINT OF HONOUR WITH HIS SUPERIORS. VARVARA PETROVNA INSTANTLY AND ACTIVELY TOOK HIM UNDER HER PROTECTION. HE EXAMINED THE PATIENT ATTENTIVELY, QUESTIONED HIM, AND CAUTIOUSLY PRONOUNCED TO VARVARA PETROVNA THAT ‚ÄÚTHE SUFFERER‚ÄÔS‚ÄÙ CONDITION WAS HIGHLY DUBIOUS IN CONSEQUENCE OF COMPLICATIONS, AND THAT THEY MUST BE PREPARED ‚ÄÚEVEN FOR THE WORST.‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA, WHO HAD DURING TWENTY YEARS GOT ACCUSTOMED TO EXPECTING NOTHING SERIOUS OR DECISIVE TO COME FROM STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, WAS DEEPLY MOVED AND EVEN TURNED PALE. ‚ÄÚIS THERE REALLY NO HOPE?‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚCAN THERE EVER BE SAID TO BE ABSOLUTELY NO HOPE? BUT ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ SHE DID NOT GO TO BED ALL NIGHT, AND FELT THAT THE MORNING WOULD NEVER COME. AS SOON AS THE PATIENT OPENED HIS EYES AND RETURNED TO CONSCIOUSNESS (HE WAS CONSCIOUS ALL THE TIME, HOWEVER, THOUGH HE WAS GROWING WEAKER EVERY HOUR), SHE WENT UP TO HIM WITH A VERY RESOLUTE AIR.

‚ÄÚSTEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, ONE MUST BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING. I‚ÄÔVE SENT FOR A PRIEST. YOU MUST DO WHAT IS RIGHT.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

KNOWING HIS CONVICTIONS, SHE WAS TERRIBLY AFRAID OF HIS REFUSING. HE LOOKED AT HER WITH SURPRISE.

‚ÄÚNONSENSE, NONSENSE!‚ÄÙ SHE VOCIFERATED, THINKING HE WAS ALREADY REFUSING. ‚ÄÚTHIS IS NO TIME FOR WHIMS. YOU HAVE PLAYED THE FOOL ENOUGH.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚBUT ‚Ä¶ AM I REALLY SO ILL, THEN?‚ÄÙ

HE AGREED THOUGHTFULLY. AND INDEED I WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO LEARN FROM VARVARA PETROVNA AFTERWARDS THAT HE SHOWED NO FEAR OF DEATH AT ALL. POSSIBLY IT WAS THAT HE SIMPLY DID NOT BELIEVE IT, AND STILL LOOKED UPON HIS ILLNESS AS A TRIFLING ONE.

HE CONFESSED AND TOOK THE SACRAMENT VERY READILY. EVERY ONE, SOFYA MATVEYEVNA, AND EVEN THE SERVANTS, CAME TO CONGRATULATE HIM ON TAKING THE SACRAMENT. THEY WERE ALL MOVED TO TEARS LOOKING AT HIS SUNKEN AND EXHAUSTED FACE AND HIS BLANCHED AND QUIVERING LIPS.

‚ÄÚOUI, MES AMIS, AND I ONLY WONDER THAT YOU ‚Ä¶ TAKE SO MUCH TROUBLE. I SHALL MOST LIKELY GET UP TO-MORROW, AND WE WILL ‚Ä¶ SET OFF.‚Ä¶ TOUTE CETTE C√©R√©MONIE ‚Ä¶ FOR WHICH, OF COURSE, I FEEL EVERY PROPER RESPECT ‚Ä¶ WAS ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚI BEG YOU, FATHER, TO REMAIN WITH THE INVALID,‚ÄÙ SAID VARVARA PETROVNA HURRIEDLY, STOPPING THE PRIEST, WHO HAD ALREADY TAKEN OFF HIS VESTMENTS. ‚ÄÚAS SOON AS TEA HAS BEEN HANDED, I BEG YOU TO BEGIN TO SPEAK OF RELIGION, TO SUPPORT HIS FAITH.‚ÄÙ

THE PRIEST SPOKE; EVERY ONE WAS STANDING OR SITTING ROUND THE SICK-BED.

‚ÄÚIN OUR SINFUL DAYS,‚ÄÙ THE PRIEST BEGAN SMOOTHLY, WITH A CUP OF TEA IN HIS HAND, ‚ÄÚFAITH IN THE MOST HIGH IS THE SOLE REFUGE OF THE RACE OF MAN IN ALL THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF LIFE, AS WELL AS ITS HOPE FOR THAT ETERNAL BLISS PROMISED TO THE RIGHTEOUS.‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SEEMED TO REVIVE, A SUBTLE SMILE STRAYED ON HIS LIPS.

‚ÄÚMON P√®RE, JE VOUS REMERCIE ET VOUS √™TES BIEN BON, MAIS ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚNO MAIS ABOUT IT, NO MAIS AT ALL!‚ÄÙ EXCLAIMED VARVARA PETROVNA, BOUNDING UP FROM HER CHAIR. ‚ÄÚFATHER,‚ÄÙ SHE SAID, ADDRESSING THE PRIEST, ‚ÄÚHE IS A MAN WHO ‚Ä¶ HE IS A MAN WHO ‚Ä¶ YOU WILL HAVE TO CONFESS HIM AGAIN IN ANOTHER HOUR! THAT‚ÄÔS THE SORT OF MAN HE IS.‚ÄÙ

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH SMILED FAINTLY.

‚ÄÚMY FRIENDS,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, ‚ÄÚGOD IS NECESSARY TO ME, IF ONLY BECAUSE HE IS THE ONLY BEING WHOM ONE CAN LOVE ETERNALLY.‚ÄÙ

WHETHER HE WAS REALLY CONVERTED, OR WHETHER THE STATELY CEREMONY OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE SACRAMENT HAD IMPRESSED HIM AND STIRRED THE ARTISTIC RESPONSIVENESS OF HIS TEMPERAMENT OR NOT, HE FIRMLY AND, I AM TOLD, WITH GREAT FEELING UTTERED SOME WORDS WHICH WERE IN FLAT CONTRADICTION WITH MANY OF HIS FORMER CONVICTIONS.

‚ÄÚMY IMMORTALITY IS NECESSARY IF ONLY BECAUSE GOD WILL NOT BE GUILTY OF INJUSTICE AND EXTINGUISH ALTOGETHER THE FLAME OF LOVE FOR HIM ONCE KINDLED IN MY HEART. AND WHAT IS MORE PRECIOUS THAN LOVE? LOVE IS HIGHER THAN EXISTENCE, LOVE IS THE CROWN OF EXISTENCE; AND HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT EXISTENCE SHOULD NOT BE UNDER ITS DOMINANCE? IF I HAVE ONCE LOVED HIM AND REJOICED IN MY LOVE, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD EXTINGUISH ME AND MY JOY AND BRING ME TO NOTHINGNESS AGAIN? IF THERE IS A GOD, THEN I AM IMMORTAL. VOIL√† MA PROFESSION DE FOI.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHERE IS A GOD, STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, I ASSURE YOU THERE IS,‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA IMPLORED HIM. ‚ÄÚGIVE IT UP, DROP ALL YOUR FOOLISHNESS FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE!‚ÄÙ (I THINK SHE HAD NOT QUITE UNDERSTOOD HIS PROFESSION DE FOI.)

‚ÄÚMY FRIEND,‚ÄÙ HE SAID, GROWING MORE AND MORE ANIMATED, THOUGH HIS VOICE BROKE FREQUENTLY, ‚ÄÚAS SOON AS I UNDERSTOOD ‚Ä¶ THAT TURNING OF THE CHEEK, I ‚Ä¶ UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL. J‚ÄÔAI MENTI TOUTE MA VIE, ALL MY LIFE, ALL! I SHOULD LIKE ‚Ä¶ BUT THAT WILL DO TO-MORROW.‚Ä¶ TO-MORROW WE WILL ALL SET OUT.‚ÄÙ

VARVARA PETROVNA BURST INTO TEARS. HE WAS LOOKING ABOUT FOR SOMEONE.

‚ÄÚHERE SHE IS, SHE IS HERE!‚ÄÙ SHE SEIZED SOFYA MATVEYEVNA BY THE HAND AND LED HER TO HIM. HE SMILED TENDERLY.

‚ÄÚOH, I SHOULD DEARLY LIKE TO LIVE AGAIN!‚ÄÙ HE EXCLAIMED WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY RUSH OF ENERGY. ‚ÄÚEVERY MINUTE, EVERY INSTANT OF LIFE OUGHT TO BE A BLESSING TO MAN ‚Ä¶ THEY OUGHT TO BE, THEY CERTAINLY OUGHT TO BE! IT‚ÄÔS THE DUTY OF MAN TO MAKE IT SO; THAT‚ÄÔS THE LAW OF HIS NATURE, WHICH ALWAYS EXISTS EVEN IF HIDDEN.‚Ä¶ OH, I WISH I COULD SEE PETRUSHA ‚Ä¶ AND ALL OF THEM ‚Ä¶ SHATOV ‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

I MAY REMARK THAT AS YET NO ONE HAD HEARD OF SHATOV‚ÄÔS FATE‚ÄÎNOT VARVARA PETROVNA NOR DARYA PAVLOVNA, NOR EVEN SALZFISH, WHO WAS THE LAST TO COME FROM THE TOWN.

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH BECAME MORE AND MORE EXCITED, FEVERISHLY SO, BEYOND HIS STRENGTH.

‚ÄÚTHE MERE FACT OF THE EVER PRESENT IDEA THAT THERE EXISTS SOMETHING INFINITELY MORE JUST AND MORE HAPPY THAN I AM FILLS ME THROUGH AND THROUGH WITH TENDER ECSTASY‚ÄÎAND GLORIFIES ME‚ÄÎOH, WHOEVER I MAY BE, WHATEVER I HAVE DONE! WHAT IS FAR MORE ESSENTIAL FOR MAN THAN PERSONAL HAPPINESS IS TO KNOW AND TO BELIEVE AT EVERY INSTANT THAT THERE IS SOMEWHERE A PERFECT AND SERENE HAPPINESS FOR ALL MEN AND FOR EVERYTHING.‚Ä¶ THE ONE ESSENTIAL CONDITION OF HUMAN EXISTENCE IS THAT MAN SHOULD ALWAYS BE ABLE TO BOW DOWN BEFORE SOMETHING INFINITELY GREAT. IF MEN ARE DEPRIVED OF THE INFINITELY GREAT THEY WILL NOT GO ON LIVING AND WILL DIE OF DESPAIR. THE INFINITE AND THE ETERNAL ARE AS ESSENTIAL FOR MAN AS THE LITTLE PLANET ON WHICH HE DWELLS. MY FRIENDS, ALL, ALL: HAIL TO THE GREAT IDEA! THE ETERNAL, INFINITE IDEA! IT IS ESSENTIAL TO EVERY MAN, WHOEVER HE MAY BE, TO BOW DOWN BEFORE WHAT IS THE GREAT IDEA. EVEN THE STUPIDEST MAN NEEDS SOMETHING GREAT. PETRUSHA ‚Ä¶ OH, HOW I WANT TO SEE THEM ALL AGAIN! THEY DON‚ÄÔT KNOW, THEY DON‚ÄÔT KNOW THAT THAT SAME ETERNAL, GRAND IDEA LIES IN THEM ALL!‚ÄÙ

DOCTOR SALZFISH WAS NOT PRESENT AT THE CEREMONY. COMING IN SUDDENLY, HE WAS HORRIFIED, AND CLEARED THE ROOM, INSISTING THAT THE PATIENT MUST NOT BE EXCITED.

STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH DIED THREE DAYS LATER, BUT BY THAT TIME HE WAS COMPLETELY UNCONSCIOUS. HE QUIETLY WENT OUT LIKE A CANDLE THAT IS BURNT DOWN. AFTER HAVING THE FUNERAL SERVICE PERFORMED, VARVARA PETROVNA TOOK THE BODY OF HER POOR FRIEND TO SKVORESHNIKI. HIS GRAVE IS IN THE PRECINCTS OF THE CHURCH AND IS ALREADY COVERED WITH A MARBLE SLAB. THE INSCRIPTION AND THE RAILING WILL BE ADDED IN THE SPRING.

VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS ABSENCE FROM TOWN HAD LASTED EIGHT DAYS. SOFYA MATVEYEVNA ARRIVED IN THE CARRIAGE WITH HER AND SEEMS TO HAVE SETTLED WITH HER FOR GOOD. I MAY MENTION THAT AS SOON AS STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH LOST CONSCIOUSNESS (THE MORNING THAT HE RECEIVED THE SACRAMENT) VARVARA PETROVNA PROMPTLY ASKED SOFYA MATVEYEVNA TO LEAVE THE COTTAGE AGAIN, AND WAITED ON THE INVALID HERSELF UNASSISTED TO THE END, BUT SHE SENT FOR HER AT ONCE WHEN HE HAD BREATHED HIS LAST. SOFYA MATVEYEVNA WAS TERRIBLY ALARMED BY VARVARA PETROVNA‚ÄÔS PROPOSITION, OR RATHER COMMAND, THAT SHE SHOULD SETTLE FOR GOOD AT SKVORESHNIKI, BUT THE LATTER REFUSED TO LISTEN TO HER PROTESTS.

‚ÄÚTHAT‚ÄÔS ALL NONSENSE! I WILL GO WITH YOU TO SELL THE GOSPEL. I HAVE NO ONE IN THE WORLD NOW.‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚYOU HAVE A SON, HOWEVER,‚ÄÙ SALZFISH OBSERVED.

‚ÄÚI HAVE NO SON!‚ÄÙ VARVARA PETROVNA SNAPPED OUT‚ÄÎAND IT WAS LIKE A PROPHECY.





CHAPTER VIII. CONCLUSION

ALL THE CRIMES AND VILLAINIES THAT HAD BEEN PERPETRATED WERE DISCOVERED WITH EXTRAORDINARY RAPIDITY, MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD EXPECTED. TO BEGIN WITH, THE LUCKLESS MARYA IGNATYEVNA WAKED UP BEFORE DAYBREAK ON THE NIGHT OF HER HUSBAND‚ÄÔS MURDER, MISSED HIM AND FLEW INTO INDESCRIBABLE AGITATION, NOT SEEING HIM BESIDE HER. THE WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN HIRED BY ANNA PROHOROVNA, AND WAS THERE FOR THE NIGHT, COULD NOT SUCCEED IN CALMING HER, AND AS SOON AS IT WAS DAYLIGHT RAN TO FETCH ARINA PROHOROVNA HERSELF, ASSURING THE INVALID THAT THE LATTER KNEW WHERE HER HUSBAND WAS, AND WHEN HE WOULD BE BACK. MEANTIME ARINA PROHOROVNA WAS IN SOME ANXIETY TOO; SHE HAD ALREADY HEARD FROM HER HUSBAND OF THE DEED PERPETRATED THAT NIGHT AT SKVORESHNIKI. HE HAD RETURNED HOME ABOUT ELEVEN O‚ÄÔCLOCK IN A TERRIBLE STATE OF MIND AND BODY; WRINGING HIS HANDS, HE FLUNG HIMSELF FACE DOWNWARDS ON HIS BED AND SHAKING WITH CONVULSIVE SOBS KEPT REPEATING, ‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS NOT RIGHT, IT‚ÄÔS NOT RIGHT, IT‚ÄÔS NOT RIGHT AT ALL!‚ÄÙ HE ENDED, OF COURSE, BY CONFESSING IT ALL TO ARINA PROHOROVNA‚ÄÎBUT TO NO ONE ELSE IN THE HOUSE. SHE LEFT HIM ON HIS BED, STERNLY IMPRESSING UPON HIM THAT ‚ÄÚIF HE MUST BLUBBER HE MUST DO IT IN HIS PILLOW SO AS NOT TO BE OVERHEARD, AND THAT HE WOULD BE A FOOL IF HE SHOWED ANY TRACES OF IT NEXT DAY.‚ÄÙ SHE FELT SOMEWHAT ANXIOUS, HOWEVER, AND BEGAN AT ONCE TO CLEAR THINGS UP IN CASE OF EMERGENCY; SHE SUCCEEDED IN HIDING OR COMPLETELY DESTROYING ALL SUSPICIOUS PAPERS, BOOKS, MANIFESTOES PERHAPS. AT THE SAME TIME SHE REFLECTED THAT SHE, HER SISTER, HER AUNT, HER SISTER-IN-LAW THE STUDENT, AND PERHAPS EVEN HER LONG-EARED BROTHER HAD REALLY NOTHING MUCH TO BE AFRAID OF. WHEN THE NURSE RAN TO HER IN THE MORNING SHE WENT WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT TO MARYA IGNATYEVNA‚ÄÔS. SHE WAS DESPERATELY ANXIOUS, MOREOVER, TO FIND OUT WHETHER WHAT HER HUSBAND HAD TOLD HER THAT NIGHT IN A TERRIFIED AND FRANTIC WHISPER, THAT WAS ALMOST LIKE DELIRIUM, WAS TRUE‚ÄÎTHAT IS, WHETHER PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD BEEN RIGHT IN HIS RECKONING THAT KIRILLOV WOULD SACRIFICE HIMSELF FOR THE GENERAL BENEFIT.

BUT SHE ARRIVED AT MARYA IGNATYEVNA‚ÄÔS TOO LATE: WHEN THE LATTER HAD SENT OFF THE WOMAN AND WAS LEFT ALONE, SHE WAS UNABLE TO BEAR THE SUSPENSE; SHE GOT OUT OF BED, AND THROWING ROUND HER THE FIRST GARMENT SHE COULD FIND, SOMETHING VERY LIGHT AND UNSUITABLE FOR THE WEATHER, I BELIEVE, SHE RAN DOWN TO KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS LODGE HERSELF, THINKING THAT HE PERHAPS WOULD BE BETTER ABLE THAN ANYONE TO TELL HER SOMETHING ABOUT HER HUSBAND. THE TERRIBLE EFFECT ON HER OF WHAT SHE SAW THERE MAY WELL BE IMAGINED. IT IS REMARKABLE THAT SHE DID NOT READ KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS LAST LETTER, WHICH LAY CONSPICUOUSLY ON THE TABLE, OVERLOOKING IT, OF COURSE, IN HER FRIGHT. SHE RAN BACK TO HER ROOM, SNATCHED UP HER BABY, AND WENT WITH IT OUT OF THE HOUSE INTO THE STREET. IT WAS A DAMP MORNING, THERE WAS A FOG. SHE MET NO PASSERS-BY IN SUCH AN OUT-OF-THE-WAY STREET. SHE RAN ON BREATHLESS THROUGH THE WET, COLD MUD, AND AT LAST BEGAN KNOCKING AT THE DOORS OF THE HOUSES. IN THE FIRST HOUSE NO ONE CAME TO THE DOOR, IN THE SECOND THEY WERE SO LONG IN COMING THAT SHE GAVE IT UP IMPATIENTLY AND BEGAN KNOCKING AT A THIRD DOOR. THIS WAS THE HOUSE OF A MERCHANT CALLED TITOV. HERE SHE WAILED AND KEPT DECLARING INCOHERENTLY THAT HER HUSBAND WAS MURDERED, CAUSING A GREAT FLUTTER IN THE HOUSE. SOMETHING WAS KNOWN ABOUT SHATOV AND HIS STORY IN THE TITOV HOUSEHOLD; THEY WERE HORROR-STRICKEN THAT SHE SHOULD BE RUNNING ABOUT THE STREETS IN SUCH ATTIRE AND IN SUCH COLD WITH THE BABY SCARCELY COVERED IN HER ARMS, WHEN, ACCORDING TO HER STORY, SHE HAD ONLY BEEN CONFINED THE DAY BEFORE. THEY THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT SHE WAS DELIRIOUS, ESPECIALLY AS THEY COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHETHER IT WAS KIRILLOV WHO WAS MURDERED OR HER HUSBAND. SEEING THAT THEY DID NOT BELIEVE HER SHE WOULD HAVE RUN ON FARTHER, BUT THEY KEPT HER BY FORCE, AND I AM TOLD SHE SCREAMED AND STRUGGLED TERRIBLY. THEY WENT TO FILIPOV‚ÄÔS, AND WITHIN TWO HOURS KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS SUICIDE AND THE LETTER HE HAD LEFT WERE KNOWN TO THE WHOLE TOWN. THE POLICE CAME TO QUESTION MARYA IGNATYEVNA, WHO WAS STILL CONSCIOUS, AND IT APPEARED AT ONCE THAT SHE HAD NOT READ KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS LETTER, AND THEY COULD NOT FIND OUT FROM HER WHAT HAD LED HER TO CONCLUDE THAT HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN MURDERED. SHE ONLY SCREAMED THAT IF KIRILLOV WAS MURDERED, THEN HER HUSBAND WAS MURDERED, THEY WERE TOGETHER. TOWARDS MIDDAY SHE SANK INTO A STATE OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS FROM WHICH SHE NEVER RECOVERED, AND SHE DIED THREE DAYS LATER. THE BABY HAD CAUGHT COLD AND DIED BEFORE HER.

ARINA PROHOROVNA NOT FINDING MARYA IGNATYEVNA AND THE BABY, AND GUESSING SOMETHING WAS WRONG, WAS ABOUT TO RUN HOME, BUT SHE CHECKED HERSELF AT THE GATE AND SENT THE NURSE TO INQUIRE OF THE GENTLEMAN AT THE LODGE WHETHER MARYA IGNATYEVNA WAS NOT THERE AND WHETHER HE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HER. THE WOMAN CAME BACK SCREAMING FRANTICALLY. PERSUADING HER NOT TO SCREAM AND NOT TO TELL ANYONE BY THE TIME-HONOURED ARGUMENT THAT ‚ÄÚSHE WOULD GET INTO TROUBLE,‚ÄÙ SHE STOLE OUT OF THE YARD.

IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT SHE WAS QUESTIONED THE SAME MORNING AS HAVING ACTED AS MIDWIFE TO MARYA IGNATYEVNA; BUT THEY DID NOT GET MUCH OUT OF HER. SHE GAVE A VERY COOL AND SENSIBLE ACCOUNT OF ALL SHE HAD HERSELF HEARD AND SEEN AT SHATOV‚ÄÔS, BUT AS TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED SHE DECLARED THAT SHE KNEW NOTHING, AND COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT.

IT MAY WELL BE IMAGINED WHAT AN UPROAR THERE WAS IN THE TOWN. A NEW ‚ÄÚSENSATION,‚ÄÙ ANOTHER MURDER! BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER ELEMENT IN THIS CASE: IT WAS CLEAR THAT A SECRET SOCIETY OF MURDERERS, INCENDIARIES, AND REVOLUTIONISTS DID EXIST, DID ACTUALLY EXIST. LIZA‚ÄÔS TERRIBLE DEATH, THE MURDER OF STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS WIFE, STAVROGIN HIMSELF, THE FIRE, THE BALL FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE GOVERNESSES, THE LAXITY OF MANNERS AND MORALS IN YULIA MIHAILOVNA‚ÄÔS CIRCLE.‚Ä¶ EVEN IN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH PEOPLE INSISTED ON SCENTING A MYSTERY. ALL SORTS OF THINGS WERE WHISPERED ABOUT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH. BY THE END OF THE DAY PEOPLE KNEW OF PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS ABSENCE TOO, AND, STRANGE TO SAY, LESS WAS SAID OF HIM THAN OF ANYONE. WHAT WAS TALKED OF MOST ALL THAT DAY WAS ‚ÄÚTHE SENATOR.‚ÄÙ THERE WAS A CROWD ALMOST ALL DAY AT FILIPOV‚ÄÔS HOUSE. THE POLICE CERTAINLY WERE LED ASTRAY BY KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS LETTER. THEY BELIEVED THAT KIRILLOV HAD MURDERED SHATOV AND HAD HIMSELF COMMITTED SUICIDE. YET, THOUGH THE AUTHORITIES WERE THROWN INTO PERPLEXITY, THEY WERE NOT ALTOGETHER HOODWINKED. THE WORD ‚ÄÚPARK,‚ÄÙ FOR INSTANCE, SO VAGUELY INSERTED IN KIRILLOV‚ÄÔS LETTER, DID NOT PUZZLE ANYONE AS PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD EXPECTED IT WOULD. THE POLICE AT ONCE MADE A RUSH FOR SKVORESHNIKI, NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY PARK IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BUT ALSO LED THITHER BY A SORT OF INSTINCT BECAUSE ALL THE HORRORS OF THE LAST FEW DAYS WERE CONNECTED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY WITH SKVORESHNIKI. THAT AT LEAST IS MY THEORY. (I MAY REMARK THAT VARVARA PETROVNA HAD DRIVEN OFF EARLY THAT MORNING IN CHASE OF STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH, AND KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE TOWN.)

THE BODY WAS FOUND IN THE POND THAT EVENING. WHAT LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF IT WAS THE FINDING OF SHATOV‚ÄÔS CAP AT THE SCENE OF THE MURDER, WHERE IT HAD BEEN WITH EXTRAORDINARY CARELESSNESS OVERLOOKED BY THE MURDERERS. THE APPEARANCE OF THE BODY, THE MEDICAL EXAMINATION AND CERTAIN DEDUCTIONS FROM IT ROUSED IMMEDIATE SUSPICIONS THAT KIRILLOV MUST HAVE HAD ACCOMPLICES. IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT A SECRET SOCIETY REALLY DID EXIST OF WHICH SHATOV AND KIRILLOV WERE MEMBERS AND WHICH WAS CONNECTED WITH THE MANIFESTOES. WHO WERE THESE ACCOMPLICES? NO ONE EVEN THOUGHT OF ANY MEMBER OF THE QUINTET THAT DAY. IT WAS ASCERTAINED THAT KIRILLOV HAD LIVED LIKE A HERMIT, AND IN SO COMPLETE A SECLUSION THAT IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE, AS STATED IN THE LETTER, FOR FEDKA TO LODGE WITH HIM FOR SO MANY DAYS, EVEN WHILE AN ACTIVE SEARCH WAS BEING MADE FOR HIM. THE CHIEF THING THAT WORRIED EVERY ONE WAS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF DISCOVERING A CONNECTING-LINK IN THIS CHAOS.

THERE IS NO SAYING WHAT CONCLUSIONS AND WHAT DISCONNECTED THEORIES OUR PANIC-STRICKEN TOWNSPEOPLE WOULD HAVE REACHED, IF THE WHOLE MYSTERY HAD NOT BEEN SUDDENLY SOLVED NEXT DAY, THANKS TO LYAMSHIN.

HE BROKE DOWN. HE BEHAVED AS EVEN PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD TOWARDS THE END BEGUN TO FEAR HE WOULD. LEFT IN CHARGE OF TOLKATCHENKO, AND AFTERWARDS OF ERKEL, HE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING DAY LYING IN HIS BED WITH HIS FACE TURNED TO THE WALL, APPARENTLY CALM, NOT UTTERING A WORD, AND SCARCELY ANSWERING WHEN HE WAS SPOKEN TO. THIS IS HOW IT WAS THAT HE HEARD NOTHING ALL DAY OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE TOWN. BUT TOLKATCHENKO, WHO WAS VERY WELL INFORMED ABOUT EVERYTHING, TOOK INTO HIS HEAD BY THE EVENING TO THROW UP THE TASK OF WATCHING LYAMSHIN WHICH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD LAID UPON HIM, AND LEFT THE TOWN, THAT IS, TO PUT IT PLAINLY, MADE HIS ESCAPE; THE FACT IS, THEY LOST THEIR HEADS AS ERKEL HAD PREDICTED THEY WOULD. I MAY MENTION, BY THE WAY, THAT LIPUTIN HAD DISAPPEARED THE SAME DAY BEFORE TWELVE O‚ÄÔCLOCK. BUT THINGS FELL OUT SO THAT HIS DISAPPEARANCE DID NOT BECOME KNOWN TO THE AUTHORITIES TILL THE EVENING OF THE FOLLOWING DAY, WHEN, THE POLICE WENT TO QUESTION HIS FAMILY, WHO WERE PANIC-STRICKEN AT HIS ABSENCE BUT KEPT QUIET FROM FEAR OF CONSEQUENCES. BUT TO RETURN TO LYAMSHIN: AS SOON AS HE WAS LEFT ALONE (ERKEL HAD GONE HOME EARLIER, RELYING ON TOLKATCHENKO) HE RAN OUT OF HIS HOUSE, AND, OF COURSE, VERY SOON LEARNED THE POSITION OF AFFAIRS. WITHOUT EVEN RETURNING HOME HE TOO TRIED TO RUN AWAY WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS GOING. BUT THE NIGHT WAS SO DARK AND TO ESCAPE WAS SO TERRIBLE AND DIFFICULT, THAT AFTER GOING THROUGH TWO OR THREE STREETS, HE RETURNED HOME AND LOCKED HIMSELF UP FOR THE WHOLE NIGHT. I BELIEVE THAT TOWARDS MORNING HE ATTEMPTED TO COMMIT SUICIDE BUT DID NOT SUCCEED. HE REMAINED LOCKED UP TILL MIDDAY‚ÄÎAND THEN SUDDENLY HE RAN TO THE AUTHORITIES. HE IS SAID TO HAVE CRAWLED ON HIS KNEES, TO HAVE SOBBED AND SHRIEKED, TO HAVE KISSED THE FLOOR CRYING OUT THAT HE WAS NOT WORTHY TO KISS THE BOOTS OF THE OFFICIALS STANDING BEFORE HIM. THEY SOOTHED HIM, WERE POSITIVELY AFFABLE TO HIM. HIS EXAMINATION LASTED, I AM TOLD, FOR THREE HOURS. HE CONFESSED EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING, TOLD EVERY DETAIL, EVERYTHING HE KNEW, EVERY POINT, ANTICIPATING THEIR QUESTIONS, HURRIED TO MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT ALL, VOLUNTEERING UNNECESSARY INFORMATION WITHOUT BEING ASKED. IT TURNED OUT THAT HE KNEW ENOUGH, AND PRESENTED THINGS IN A FAIRLY TRUE LIGHT: THE TRAGEDY OF SHATOV AND KIRILLOV, THE FIRE, THE DEATH OF THE LEBYADKINS, AND THE REST OF IT WERE RELEGATED TO THE BACKGROUND. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, THE SECRET SOCIETY, THE ORGANISATION, AND THE NETWORK WERE PUT IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHEN ASKED WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF SO MANY MURDERS AND SCANDALS AND DASTARDLY OUTRAGES, HE ANSWERED WITH FEVERISH HASTE THAT ‚ÄÚIT WAS WITH THE IDEA OF SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERMINING THE FOUNDATIONS, SYSTEMATICALLY DESTROYING SOCIETY AND ALL PRINCIPLES; WITH THE IDEA OF NONPLUSSING EVERY ONE AND MAKING HAY OF EVERYTHING, AND THEN, WHEN SOCIETY WAS TOTTERING, SICK AND OUT OF JOINT, CYNICAL AND SCEPTICAL THOUGH FILLED WITH AN INTENSE EAGERNESS FOR SELF-PRESERVATION AND FOR SOME GUIDING IDEA, SUDDENLY TO SEIZE IT IN THEIR HANDS, RAISING THE STANDARD OF REVOLT AND RELYING ON A COMPLETE NETWORK OF QUINTETS, WHICH WERE ACTIVELY, MEANWHILE, GATHERING RECRUITS AND SEEKING OUT THE WEAK SPOTS WHICH COULD BE ATTACKED.‚ÄÙ IN CONCLUSION, HE SAID THAT HERE IN OUR TOWN PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD ORGANISED ONLY THE FIRST EXPERIMENT IN SUCH SYSTEMATIC DISORDER, SO TO SPEAK, AS A PROGRAMME FOR FURTHER ACTIVITY, AND FOR ALL THE QUINTETS‚ÄÎAND THAT THIS WAS HIS OWN (LYAMSHIN‚ÄÔS) IDEA, HIS OWN THEORY, ‚ÄÚAND THAT HE HOPED THEY WOULD REMEMBER IT AND BEAR IN MIND HOW OPENLY AND PROPERLY HE HAD GIVEN HIS INFORMATION, AND THEREFORE MIGHT BE OF USE HEREAFTER.‚ÄÙ BEING ASKED DEFINITELY HOW MANY QUINTETS THERE WERE, HE ANSWERED THAT THERE WERE IMMENSE NUMBERS OF THEM, THAT ALL RUSSIA WAS OVERSPREAD WITH A NETWORK, AND ALTHOUGH HE BROUGHT FORWARD NO PROOFS, I BELIEVE HIS ANSWER WAS PERFECTLY SINCERE. HE PRODUCED ONLY THE PROGRAMME OF THE SOCIETY, PRINTED ABROAD, AND THE PLAN FOR DEVELOPING A SYSTEM OF FUTURE ACTIVITY ROUGHLY SKETCHED IN PYOTR STEPANOVITCH‚ÄÔS OWN HANDWRITING. IT APPEARED THAT LYAMSHIN HAD QUOTED THE PHRASE ABOUT ‚ÄÚUNDERMINING THE FOUNDATION,‚ÄÙ WORD FOR WORD FROM THIS DOCUMENT, NOT OMITTING A SINGLE STOP OR COMMA, THOUGH HE HAD DECLARED THAT IT WAS ALL HIS OWN THEORY. OF YULIA MIHAILOVNA HE VERY FUNNILY AND QUITE WITHOUT PROVOCATION VOLUNTEERED THE REMARK, THAT ‚ÄÚSHE WAS INNOCENT AND HAD BEEN MADE A FOOL OF.‚ÄÙ BUT, STRANGE TO SAY, HE EXONERATED NIKOLAY STAVROGIN FROM ALL SHARE IN THE SECRET SOCIETY, FROM ANY COLLABORATION WITH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. (LYAMSHIN HAD NO CONCEPTION OF THE SECRET AND VERY ABSURD HOPES THAT PYOTR STEPANOVITCH WAS RESTING ON STAVROGIN.) ACCORDING TO HIS STORY NIKOLAY STAVROGIN HAD NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH THE DEATH OF THE LEBYADKINS, WHICH HAD BEEN PLANNED BY PYOTR STEPANOVITCH ALONE AND WITH THE SUBTLE AIM OF IMPLICATING THE FORMER IN THE CRIME, AND THEREFORE MAKING HIM DEPENDENT ON PYOTR STEPANOVITCH; BUT INSTEAD OF THE GRATITUDE ON WHICH PYOTR STEPANOVITCH HAD RECKONED WITH SHALLOW CONFIDENCE, HE HAD ROUSED NOTHING BUT INDIGNATION AND EVEN DESPAIR IN ‚ÄÚTHE GENEROUS HEART OF NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH.‚ÄÙ HE WOUND UP, BY A HINT, EVIDENTLY INTENTIONAL, VOLUNTEERED HASTILY, THAT STAVROGIN WAS PERHAPS A VERY IMPORTANT PERSONAGE, BUT THAT THERE WAS SOME SECRET ABOUT THAT, THAT HE HAD BEEN LIVING AMONG US, SO TO SAY, INCOGNITO, THAT HE HAD SOME COMMISSION, AND THAT VERY POSSIBLY HE WOULD COME BACK TO US AGAIN FROM PETERSBURG. (LYAMSHIN WAS CONVINCED THAT STAVROGIN HAD GONE TO PETERSBURG), BUT IN QUITE A DIFFERENT CAPACITY AND IN DIFFERENT SURROUNDINGS, IN THE SUITE OF PERSONS OF WHOM PERHAPS WE SHOULD SOON HEAR, AND THAT ALL THIS HE HAD HEARD FROM PYOTR STEPANOVITCH, ‚ÄÚNIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH‚ÄÔS SECRET ENEMY.‚ÄÙ

HERE I WILL NOTE THAT TWO MONTHS LATER, LYAMSHIN ADMITTED THAT HE HAD EXONERATED STAVROGIN ON PURPOSE, HOPING THAT HE WOULD PROTECT HIM AND WOULD OBTAIN FOR HIM A MITIGATION IN THE SECOND DEGREE OF HIS SENTENCE, AND THAT HE WOULD PROVIDE HIM WITH MONEY AND LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION IN SIBERIA. FROM THIS CONFESSION IT IS EVIDENT THAT HE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARILY EXAGGERATED CONCEPTION OF STAVROGIN‚ÄÔS POWERS.

ON THE SAME DAY, OF COURSE, THE POLICE ARRESTED VIRGINSKY AND IN THEIR ZEAL TOOK HIS WHOLE FAMILY TOO. (ARINA PROHOROVNA, HER SISTER, AUNT, AND EVEN THE GIRL STUDENT WERE RELEASED LONG AGO; THEY SAY THAT SHIGALOV TOO WILL BE SET FREE VERY SHORTLY BECAUSE HE CANNOT BE CLASSED WITH ANY OF THE OTHER PRISONERS. BUT ALL THAT IS SO FAR ONLY GOSSIP.) VIRGINSKY AT ONCE PLEADED GUILTY. HE WAS LYING ILL WITH FEVER WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED. I AM TOLD THAT HE SEEMED ALMOST RELIEVED; ‚ÄÚIT WAS A LOAD OFF HIS HEART,‚ÄÙ HE IS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID. IT IS RUMOURED THAT HE IS GIVING HIS EVIDENCE WITHOUT RESERVATION, BUT WITH A CERTAIN DIGNITY, AND HAS NOT GIVEN UP ANY OF HIS ‚ÄÚBRIGHT HOPES,‚ÄÙ THOUGH AT THE SAME TIME HE CURSES THE POLITICAL METHOD (AS OPPOSED TO THE SOCIALIST ONE), IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN UNWITTINGLY AND HEEDLESSLY CARRIED ‚ÄÚBY THE VORTEX OF COMBINED CIRCUMSTANCES.‚ÄÙ HIS CONDUCT AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER HAS BEEN PUT IN A FAVOURABLE LIGHT, AND I IMAGINE THAT HE TOO MAY RECKON ON SOME MITIGATION OF HIS SENTENCE. THAT AT LEAST IS WHAT IS ASSERTED IN THE TOWN.

BUT I DOUBT WHETHER THERE IS ANY HOPE FOR MERCY IN ERKEL‚ÄÔS CASE. EVER SINCE HIS ARREST HE HAS BEEN OBSTINATELY SILENT, OR HAS MISREPRESENTED THE FACTS AS FAR AS HE COULD. NOT ONE WORD OF REGRET HAS BEEN WRUNG FROM HIM SO FAR. YET EVEN THE STERNEST OF THE JUDGES TRYING HIM HAS BEEN MOVED TO SOME COMPASSION BY HIS YOUTH, BY HIS HELPLESSNESS, BY THE UNMISTAKABLE EVIDENCE THAT HE IS NOTHING BUT A FANATICAL VICTIM OF A POLITICAL IMPOSTOR, AND, MOST OF ALL, BY HIS CONDUCT TO HIS MOTHER, TO WHOM, AS IT APPEARS, HE USED TO SEND ALMOST THE HALF OF HIS SMALL SALARY. HIS MOTHER IS NOW IN THE TOWN; SHE IS A DELICATE AND AILING WOMAN, AGED BEYOND HER YEARS; SHE WEEPS AND POSITIVELY GROVELS ON THE GROUND IMPLORING MERCY FOR HER SON. WHATEVER MAY HAPPEN, MANY AMONG US FEEL SORRY FOR ERKEL.

LIPUTIN WAS ARRESTED IN PETERSBURG, WHERE HE HAD BEEN LIVING FOR A FORTNIGHT. HIS CONDUCT THERE SOUNDS ALMOST INCREDIBLE AND IS DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN. HE IS SAID TO HAVE HAD A PASSPORT IN A FORGED NAME AND QUITE A LARGE SUM OF MONEY UPON HIM, AND HAD EVERY POSSIBILITY OF ESCAPING ABROAD, YET INSTEAD OF GOING HE REMAINED IN PETERSBURG. HE SPENT SOME TIME HUNTING FOR STAVROGIN AND PYOTR STEPANOVITCH. SUDDENLY HE TOOK TO DRINKING AND GAVE HIMSELF UP TO A DEBAUCHERY THAT EXCEEDED ALL BOUNDS, LIKE A MAN WHO HAD LOST ALL REASON AND UNDERSTANDING OF HIS POSITION. HE WAS ARRESTED IN PETERSBURG DRUNK IN A BROTHEL. THERE IS A RUMOUR THAT HE HAS NOT BY ANY MEANS LOST HEART, THAT HE TELLS LIES IN HIS EVIDENCE AND IS PREPARING FOR THE APPROACHING TRIAL HOPEFULLY (?) AND, AS IT WERE, TRIUMPHANTLY. HE EVEN INTENDS TO MAKE A SPEECH AT THE TRIAL. TOLKATCHENKO, WHO WAS ARRESTED IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TEN DAYS AFTER HIS FLIGHT, BEHAVES WITH INCOMPARABLY MORE DECORUM; HE DOES NOT SHUFFLE OR TELL LIES, HE TELLS ALL HE KNOWS, DOES NOT JUSTIFY HIMSELF, BLAMES HIMSELF WITH ALL MODESTY, THOUGH HE, TOO, HAS A WEAKNESS FOR RHETORIC; HE TELLS READILY WHAT HE KNOWS, AND WHEN KNOWLEDGE OF THE PEASANTRY AND THE REVOLUTIONARY ELEMENTS AMONG THEM IS TOUCHED UPON, HE POSITIVELY ATTITUDINISES AND IS EAGER TO PRODUCE AN EFFECT. HE, TOO, IS MEANING, I AM TOLD, TO MAKE A SPEECH AT THE TRIAL. NEITHER HE NOR LIPUTIN SEEM VERY MUCH AFRAID, CURIOUS AS IT SEEMS.

I REPEAT THAT THE CASE IS NOT YET OVER. NOW, THREE MONTHS AFTERWARDS, LOCAL SOCIETY HAS HAD TIME TO REST, HAS RECOVERED, HAS GOT OVER IT, HAS AN OPINION OF ITS OWN, SO MUCH SO THAT SOME PEOPLE POSITIVELY LOOK UPON PYOTR STEPANOVITCH AS A GENIUS OR AT LEAST AS POSSESSED OF ‚ÄÚSOME CHARACTERISTICS OF A GENIUS.‚ÄÙ ‚ÄÚORGANISATION!‚ÄÙ THEY SAY AT THE CLUB, HOLDING UP A FINGER. BUT ALL THIS IS VERY INNOCENT AND THERE ARE NOT MANY PEOPLE WHO TALK LIKE THAT. OTHERS, ON THE OTHER HAND, DO NOT DENY HIS ACUTENESS, BUT POINT OUT THAT HE WAS UTTERLY IGNORANT OF REAL LIFE, THAT HE WAS TERRIBLY THEORETICAL, GROTESQUELY AND STUPIDLY ONE-SIDED, AND CONSEQUENTLY SHALLOW IN THE EXTREME. AS FOR HIS MORAL QUALITIES ALL ARE AGREED; ABOUT THAT THERE ARE NO TWO OPINIONS.

I DO NOT KNOW WHOM TO MENTION NEXT SO AS NOT TO FORGET ANYONE. MAVRIKY NIKOLAEVITCH HAS GONE AWAY FOR GOOD, I DON‚ÄÔT KNOW WHERE. OLD MADAME DROZDOV HAS SUNK INTO DOTAGE.‚Ä¶ I HAVE STILL ONE VERY GLOOMY STORY TO TELL, HOWEVER. I WILL CONFINE MYSELF TO THE BARE FACTS.

ON HER RETURN FROM USTYEVO, VARVARA PETROVNA STAYED AT HER TOWN HOUSE. ALL THE ACCUMULATED NEWS BROKE UPON HER AT ONCE AND GAVE HER A TERRIBLE SHOCK. SHE SHUT HERSELF UP ALONE. IT WAS EVENING; EVERY ONE WAS TIRED AND WENT TO BED EARLY.

IN THE MORNING A MAID WITH A MYSTERIOUS AIR HANDED A NOTE TO DARYA PAVLOVNA. THE NOTE HAD, SO SHE SAID, ARRIVED THE EVENING BEFORE, BUT LATE, WHEN ALL HAD GONE TO BED, SO THAT SHE HAD NOT VENTURED TO WAKE HER. IT HAD NOT COME BY POST, BUT HAD BEEN PUT IN ALEXEY YEGORYTCH‚ÄÔS HAND IN SKVORESHNIKI BY SOME UNKNOWN PERSON. AND ALEXEY YEGORYTCH HAD IMMEDIATELY SET OFF AND PUT IT INTO HER HANDS HIMSELF AND HAD THEN RETURNED TO SKVORESHNIKI.

FOR A LONG WHILE DARYA PAVLOVNA GAZED AT THE LETTER WITH A BEATING HEART, AND DARED NOT OPEN IT. SHE KNEW FROM WHOM IT CAME: THE WRITER WAS NIKOLAY STAVROGIN. SHE READ WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON THE ENVELOPE: ‚ÄÚTO ALEXEY YEGORYTCH, TO BE GIVEN SECRETLY TO DARYA PAVLOVNA.‚ÄÙ

HERE IS THE LETTER WORD FOR WORD, WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST CORRECTION OF THE DEFECTS IN STYLE OF A RUSSIAN ARISTOCRAT WHO HAD NEVER MASTERED THE RUSSIAN GRAMMAR IN SPITE OF HIS EUROPEAN EDUCATION.

‚ÄÚDEAR DARYA PAVLOVNA,‚ÄÎAT ONE TIME YOU EXPRESSED A WISH TO BE MY NURSE AND MADE ME PROMISE TO SEND FOR YOU WHEN I WANTED YOU. I AM GOING AWAY IN TWO DAYS AND SHALL NOT COME BACK. WILL YOU GO WITH ME?

‚ÄÚLAST YEAR, LIKE HERZEN, I WAS NATURALISED AS A CITIZEN OF THE CANTON OF URI, AND THAT NOBODY KNOWS. THERE I‚ÄÔVE ALREADY BOUGHT A LITTLE HOUSE. I‚ÄÔVE STILL TWELVE THOUSAND ROUBLES LEFT; WE‚ÄÔLL GO AND LIVE THERE FOR EVER. I DON‚ÄÔT WANT TO GO ANYWHERE ELSE EVER.

‚ÄÚIT‚ÄÔS A VERY DULL PLACE, A NARROW VALLEY, THE MOUNTAINS RESTRICT BOTH VISION AND THOUGHT. IT‚ÄÔS VERY GLOOMY. I CHOSE THE PLACE BECAUSE THERE WAS A LITTLE HOUSE TO BE SOLD. IF YOU DON‚ÄÔT LIKE IT I‚ÄÔLL SELL IT AND BUY ANOTHER IN SOME OTHER PLACE.

‚ÄÚI AM NOT WELL, BUT I HOPE TO GET RID OF HALLUCINATIONS IN THAT AIR. IT‚ÄÔS PHYSICAL, AND AS FOR THE MORAL YOU KNOW EVERYTHING; BUT DO YOU KNOW ALL?

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE TOLD YOU A GREAT DEAL OF MY LIFE, BUT NOT ALL. EVEN TO YOU! NOT ALL. BY THE WAY, I REPEAT THAT IN MY CONSCIENCE I FEEL MYSELF RESPONSIBLE FOR MY WIFE‚ÄÔS DEATH. I HAVEN‚ÄÔT SEEN YOU SINCE THEN, THAT‚ÄÔS WHY I REPEAT IT. I FEEL GUILTY ABOUT LIZAVETA NIKOLAEVNA TOO; BUT YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT; YOU FORETOLD ALMOST ALL THAT.

‚ÄÚBETTER NOT COME TO ME. MY ASKING YOU TO IS A HORRIBLE MEANNESS. AND WHY SHOULD YOU BURY YOUR LIFE WITH ME? YOU ARE DEAR TO ME, AND WHEN I WAS MISERABLE IT WAS GOOD TO BE BESIDE YOU; ONLY WITH YOU I COULD SPEAK OF MYSELF ALOUD. BUT THAT PROVES NOTHING. YOU DEFINED IT YOURSELF, ‚ÄÒA NURSE‚ÄÔ‚ÄÎIT‚ÄÔS YOUR OWN EXPRESSION; WHY SACRIFICE SO MUCH? GRASP THIS, TOO, THAT I HAVE NO PITY FOR YOU SINCE I ASK YOU, AND NO RESPECT FOR YOU SINCE I RECKON ON YOU. AND YET I ASK YOU AND I RECKON ON YOU. IN ANY CASE I NEED YOUR ANSWER FOR I MUST SET OFF VERY SOON. IN THAT CASE I SHALL GO ALONE.

‚ÄÚI EXPECT NOTHING OF URI; I AM SIMPLY GOING. I HAVE NOT CHOSEN A GLOOMY PLACE ON PURPOSE. I HAVE NO TIES IN RUSSIA‚ÄÎEVERYTHING IS AS ALIEN TO ME THERE AS EVERYWHERE. IT‚ÄÔS TRUE THAT I DISLIKE LIVING THERE MORE THAN ANYWHERE; BUT I CAN‚ÄÔT HATE ANYTHING EVEN THERE!

‚ÄÚI‚ÄÔVE TRIED MY STRENGTH EVERYWHERE. YOU ADVISED ME TO DO THIS ‚ÄÒTHAT I MIGHT LEARN TO KNOW MYSELF.‚ÄÔ AS LONG AS I WAS EXPERIMENTING FOR MYSELF AND FOR OTHERS IT SEEMED INFINITE, AS IT HAS ALL MY LIFE. BEFORE YOUR EYES I ENDURED A BLOW FROM YOUR BROTHER; I ACKNOWLEDGED MY MARRIAGE IN PUBLIC. BUT TO WHAT TO APPLY MY STRENGTH, THAT IS WHAT I‚ÄÔVE NEVER SEEN, AND DO NOT SEE NOW IN SPITE OF ALL YOUR PRAISES IN SWITZERLAND, WHICH I BELIEVED IN. I AM STILL CAPABLE, AS I ALWAYS WAS, OF DESIRING TO DO SOMETHING GOOD, AND OF FEELING PLEASURE FROM IT; AT THE SAME TIME I DESIRE EVIL AND FEEL PLEASURE FROM THAT TOO. BUT BOTH FEELINGS ARE ALWAYS TOO PETTY, AND ARE NEVER VERY STRONG. MY DESIRES ARE TOO WEAK; THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH TO GUIDE ME. ON A LOG ONE MAY CROSS A RIVER BUT NOT ON A CHIP. I SAY THIS THAT YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE THAT I AM GOING TO URI WITH HOPES OF ANY SORT.

‚ÄÚAS ALWAYS I BLAME NO ONE. I‚ÄÔVE TRIED THE DEPTHS OF DEBAUCHERY AND WASTED MY STRENGTH OVER IT. BUT I DON‚ÄÔT LIKE VICE AND I DIDN‚ÄÔT WANT IT. YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING ME OF LATE. DO YOU KNOW THAT I LOOKED UPON OUR ICONOCLASTS WITH SPITE, FROM ENVY OF THEIR HOPES? BUT YOU HAD NO NEED TO BE AFRAID. I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ONE OF THEM FOR I NEVER SHARED ANYTHING WITH THEM. AND TO DO IT FOR FUN, FROM SPITE I COULD NOT EITHER, NOT BECAUSE I AM AFRAID OF THE RIDICULOUS‚ÄÎI CANNOT BE AFRAID OF THE RIDICULOUS‚ÄÎBUT BECAUSE I HAVE, AFTER ALL, THE HABITS OF A GENTLEMAN AND IT DISGUSTED ME. BUT IF I HAD FELT MORE SPITE AND ENVY OF THEM I MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE JOINED THEM. YOU CAN JUDGE HOW HARD IT HAS BEEN FOR ME, AND HOW I‚ÄÔVE STRUGGLED FROM ONE THING TO ANOTHER.

‚ÄÚDEAR FRIEND! GREAT AND TENDER HEART WHICH I DIVINED! PERHAPS YOU DREAM OF GIVING ME SO MUCH LOVE AND LAVISHING ON ME SO MUCH THAT IS BEAUTIFUL FROM YOUR BEAUTIFUL SOUL, THAT YOU HOPE TO SET UP SOME AIM FOR ME AT LAST BY IT? NO, IT‚ÄÔS BETTER FOR YOU TO BE MORE CAUTIOUS, MY LOVE WILL BE AS PETTY AS I AM MYSELF AND YOU WILL BE UNHAPPY. YOUR BROTHER TOLD ME THAT THE MAN WHO LOSES CONNECTION WITH HIS COUNTRY LOSES HIS GODS, THAT IS, ALL HIS AIMS. ONE MAY ARGUE ABOUT EVERYTHING ENDLESSLY, BUT FROM ME NOTHING HAS COME BUT NEGATION, WITH NO GREATNESS OF SOUL, NO FORCE. EVEN NEGATION HAS NOT COME FROM ME. EVERYTHING HAS ALWAYS BEEN PETTY AND SPIRITLESS. KIRILLOV, IN THE GREATNESS OF HIS SOUL, COULD NOT COMPROMISE WITH AN IDEA, AND SHOT HIMSELF; BUT I SEE, OF COURSE, THAT HE WAS GREAT-SOULED BECAUSE HE HAD LOST HIS REASON. I CAN NEVER LOSE MY REASON, AND I CAN NEVER BELIEVE IN AN IDEA TO SUCH A DEGREE AS HE DID. I CANNOT EVEN BE INTERESTED IN AN IDEA TO SUCH A DEGREE. I CAN NEVER, NEVER SHOOT MYSELF.

‚ÄÚI KNOW I OUGHT TO KILL MYSELF, TO BRUSH MYSELF OFF THE EARTH LIKE A NASTY INSECT; BUT I AM AFRAID OF SUICIDE, FOR I AM AFRAID OF SHOWING GREATNESS OF SOUL. I KNOW THAT IT WILL BE ANOTHER SHAM AGAIN‚ÄÎTHE LAST DECEPTION IN AN ENDLESS SERIES OF DECEPTIONS. WHAT GOOD IS THERE IN DECEIVING ONESELF? SIMPLY TO PLAY AT GREATNESS OF SOUL? INDIGNATION AND SHAME I CAN NEVER FEEL, THEREFORE NOT DESPAIR.

‚ÄÚFORGIVE ME FOR WRITING SO MUCH. I WROTE WITHOUT NOTICING. A HUNDRED PAGES WOULD BE TOO LITTLE AND TEN LINES WOULD BE ENOUGH. TEN LINES WOULD BE ENOUGH TO ASK YOU TO BE A NURSE. SINCE I LEFT SKVORESHNIKI I‚ÄÔVE BEEN LIVING AT THE SIXTH STATION ON THE LINE, AT THE STATIONMASTER‚ÄÔS. I GOT TO KNOW HIM IN THE TIME OF DEBAUCHERY FIVE YEARS AGO IN PETERSBURG. NO ONE KNOWS I AM LIVING THERE. WRITE TO HIM. I ENCLOSE THE ADDRESS.

‚ÄÚNIKOLAY STAVROGIN.‚ÄÙ

DARYA PAVLOVNA WENT AT ONCE AND SHOWED THE LETTER TO VARVARA PETROVNA. SHE READ IT AND ASKED DASHA TO GO OUT OF THE ROOM SO THAT SHE MIGHT READ IT AGAIN ALONE; BUT SHE CALLED HER BACK VERY QUICKLY.

‚ÄÚARE YOU GOING?‚ÄÙ SHE ASKED ALMOST TIMIDLY.

‚ÄÚI AM GOING,‚ÄÙ ANSWERED DASHA.

‚ÄÚGET READY! WE‚ÄÔLL GO TOGETHER.‚ÄÙ

DASHA LOOKED AT HER INQUIRINGLY.

‚ÄÚWHAT IS THERE LEFT FOR ME TO DO HERE? WHAT DIFFICULTY WILL IT MAKE? I‚ÄÔLL BE NATURALISED IN URI, TOO, AND LIVE IN THE VALLEY.‚Ä¶ DON‚ÄÔT BE UNEASY, I WON‚ÄÔT BE IN THE WAY.‚ÄÙ

THEY BEGAN PACKING QUICKLY TO BE IN TIME TO CATCH THE MIDDAY TRAIN. BUT IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR‚ÄÔS TIME ALEXEY YEGORYTCH ARRIVED FROM SKVORESHNIKI. HE ANNOUNCED THAT NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAD SUDDENLY ARRIVED THAT MORNING BY THE EARLY TRAIN, AND WAS NOW AT SKVORESHNIKI BUT ‚ÄÚIN SUCH A STATE THAT HIS HONOUR DID NOT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS, WALKED THROUGH ALL THE ROOMS AND SHUT HIMSELF UP IN HIS OWN WING.‚Ä¶‚ÄÙ

‚ÄÚTHOUGH I RECEIVED NO ORDERS I THOUGHT IT BEST TO COME AND INFORM YOU,‚ÄÙ ALEXEY YEGORYTCH CONCLUDED WITH A VERY SIGNIFICANT EXPRESSION.

VARVARA PETROVNA LOOKED AT HIM SEARCHINGLY AND DID NOT QUESTION HIM. THE CARRIAGE WAS GOT READY INSTANTLY. VARVARA PETROVNA SET OFF WITH DASHA. THEY SAY THAT SHE KEPT CROSSING HERSELF ON THE JOURNEY.

IN NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH‚ÄÔS WING OF THE HOUSE ALL THE DOORS WERE OPEN AND HE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.

‚ÄÚWOULDN‚ÄÔT HE BE UPSTAIRS?‚ÄÙ FOMUSHKA VENTURED.

IT WAS REMARKABLE THAT SEVERAL SERVANTS FOLLOWED VARVARA PETROVNA WHILE THE OTHERS ALL STOOD WAITING IN THE DRAWING-ROOM. THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE DARED TO COMMIT SUCH A BREACH OF ETIQUETTE BEFORE. VARVARA PETROVNA SAW IT AND SAID NOTHING.

THEY WENT UPSTAIRS. THERE THERE WERE THREE ROOMS; BUT THEY FOUND NO ONE THERE.

‚ÄÚWOULDN‚ÄÔT HIS HONOUR HAVE GONE UP THERE?‚ÄÙ SOMEONE SUGGESTED, POINTING TO THE DOOR OF THE LOFT. AND IN FACT, THE DOOR OF THE LOFT WHICH WAS ALWAYS CLOSED HAD BEEN OPENED AND WAS STANDING AJAR. THE LOFT WAS RIGHT UNDER THE ROOF AND WAS REACHED BY A LONG, VERY STEEP AND NARROW WOODEN LADDER. THERE WAS A SORT OF LITTLE ROOM UP THERE TOO.

‚ÄÚI AM NOT GOING UP THERE. WHY SHOULD HE GO UP THERE?‚ÄÙ SAID VARVARA PETROVNA, TURNING TERRIBLY PALE AS SHE LOOKED AT THE SERVANTS. THEY GAZED BACK AT HER AND SAID NOTHING. DASHA WAS TREMBLING.

VARVARA PETROVNA RUSHED UP THE LADDER; DASHA FOLLOWED, BUT SHE HAD HARDLY ENTERED THE LOFT WHEN SHE UTTERED A SCREAM AND FELL SENSELESS.

THE CITIZEN OF THE CANTON OF URI WAS HANGING THERE BEHIND THE DOOR. ON THE TABLE LAY A PIECE OF PAPER WITH THE WORDS IN PENCIL: ‚ÄÚNO ONE IS TO BLAME, I DID IT MYSELF.‚ÄÙ BESIDE IT ON THE TABLE LAY A HAMMER, A PIECE OF SOAP, AND A LARGE NAIL‚ÄÎOBVIOUSLY AN EXTRA ONE IN CASE OF NEED. THE STRONG SILK CORD UPON WHICH NIKOLAY VSYEVOLODOVITCH HAD HANGED HIMSELF HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN CHOSEN AND PREPARED BEFOREHAND AND WAS THICKLY SMEARED WITH SOAP. EVERYTHING PROVED THAT THERE HAD BEEN PREMEDITATION AND CONSCIOUSNESS UP TO THE LAST MOMENT.

AT THE INQUEST OUR DOCTORS ABSOLUTELY AND EMPHATICALLY REJECTED ALL IDEA OF INSANITY.

THE END






GERONTION
       THOU HAST NOR YOUTH NOR AGE
       BUT AS IT WERE AN AFTER DINNER SLEEP
       DREAMING OF BOTH.
     HERE I AM, AN OLD MAN IN A DRY MONTH,
     BEING READ TO BY A BOY, WAITING FOR RAIN.
     I WAS NEITHER AT THE HOT GATES
     NOR FOUGHT IN THE WARM RAIN
     NOR KNEE DEEP IN THE SALT MARSH, HEAVING A CUTLASS,
     BITTEN BY FLIES, FOUGHT.
     MY HOUSE IS A DECAYED HOUSE,
     AND THE JEW SQUATS ON THE WINDOW SILL, THE OWNER,
     SPAWNED IN SOME ESTAMINET OF ANTWERP,
     BLISTERED IN BRUSSELS, PATCHED AND PEELED IN LONDON.
     THE GOAT COUGHS AT NIGHT IN THE FIELD OVERHEAD;
     ROCKS, MOSS, STONECROP, IRON, MERDS.
     THE WOMAN KEEPS THE KITCHEN, MAKES TEA,
     SNEEZES AT EVENING, POKING THE PEEVISH GUTTER.

                       I AN OLD MAN,
     A DULL HEAD AMONG WINDY SPACES.

     SIGNS ARE TAKEN FOR WONDERS. "WE WOULD SEE A SIGN":
     THE WORD WITHIN A WORD, UNABLE TO SPEAK A WORD,
     SWADDLED WITH DARKNESS. IN THE JUVESCENCE OF THE YEAR
     CAME CHRIST THE TIGER

     IN DEPRAVED MAY, DOGWOOD AND CHESTNUT, FLOWERING JUDAS,
     TO BE EATEN, TO BE DIVIDED, TO BE DRUNK
     AMONG WHISPERS; BY MR. SILVERO
     WITH CARESSING HANDS, AT LIMOGES
     WHO WALKED ALL NIGHT IN THE NEXT ROOM;
     BY HAKAGAWA, BOWING AMONG THE TITIANS;
     BY MADAME DE TORNQUIST, IN THE DARK ROOM
     SHIFTING THE CANDLES; FRAULEIN VON KULP
     WHO TURNED IN THE HALL, ONE HAND ON THE DOOR. VACANT SHUTTLES
     WEAVE THE WIND. I HAVE NO GHOSTS,
     AN OLD MAN IN A DRAUGHTY HOUSE
     UNDER A WINDY KNOB.

     AFTER SUCH KNOWLEDGE, WHAT FORGIVENESS? THINK NOW
     HISTORY HAS MANY CUNNING PASSAGES, CONTRIVED CORRIDORS
     AND ISSUES, DECEIVES WITH WHISPERING AMBITIONS,
     GUIDES US BY VANITIES. THINK NOW
     SHE GIVES WHEN OUR ATTENTION IS DISTRACTED
     AND WHAT SHE GIVES, GIVES WITH SUCH SUPPLE CONFUSIONS
     THAT THE GIVING FAMISHES THE CRAVING. GIVES TOO LATE
     WHAT'S NOT BELIEVED IN, OR IF STILL BELIEVED,
     IN MEMORY ONLY, RECONSIDERED PASSION. GIVES TOO SOON
     INTO WEAK HANDS, WHAT'S THOUGHT CAN BE DISPENSED WITH
     TILL THE REFUSAL PROPAGATES A FEAR. THINK
     NEITHER FEAR NOR COURAGE SAVES US. UNNATURAL VICES
     ARE FATHERED BY OUR HEROISM. VIRTUES
     ARE FORCED UPON US BY OUR IMPUDENT CRIMES.
     THESE TEARS ARE SHAKEN FROM THE WRATH-BEARING TREE.

     THE TIGER SPRINGS IN THE NEW YEAR. US HE DEVOURS. THINK AT LAST
     WE HAVE NOT REACHED CONCLUSION, WHEN I
     STIFFEN IN A RENTED HOUSE. THINK AT LAST
     I HAVE NOT MADE THIS SHOW PURPOSELESSLY
     AND IT IS NOT BY ANY CONCITATION
     OF THE BACKWARD DEVILS.
     I WOULD MEET YOU UPON THIS HONESTLY.
     I THAT WAS NEAR YOUR HEART WAS REMOVED THEREFROM
     TO LOSE BEAUTY IN TERROR, TERROR IN INQUISITION.
     I HAVE LOST MY PASSION: WHY SHOULD I NEED TO KEEP IT
     SINCE WHAT IS KEPT MUST BE ADULTERATED?
     I HAVE LOST MY SIGHT, SMELL, HEARING, TASTE AND TOUCH:
     HOW SHOULD I USE IT FOR YOUR CLOSER CONTACT?

     THESE WITH A THOUSAND SMALL DELIBERATIONS
     PROTRACT THE PROFIT OF THEIR CHILLED DELIRIUM,
     EXCITE THE MEMBRANE, WHEN THE SENSE HAS COOLED,
     WITH PUNGENT SAUCES, MULTIPLY VARIETY
     IN A WILDERNESS OF MIRRORS. WHAT WILL THE SPIDER DO,
     SUSPEND ITS OPERATIONS, WILL THE WEEVIL
     DELAY? DE BAILHACHE, FRESCA, MRS. CAMMEL, WHIRLED
     BEYOND THE CIRCUIT OF THE SHUDDERING BEAR
     IN FRACTURED ATOMS. GULL AGAINST THE WIND, IN THE WINDY STRAITS
     OF BELLE ISLE, OR RUNNING ON THE HORN,
     WHITE FEATHERS IN THE SNOW, THE GULF CLAIMS,
     AND AN OLD MAN DRIVEN BY THE TRADES
     TO A SLEEPY CORNER.

BURBANK WITH A BAEDEKER: BLEISTEIN WITH A CIGAR
       TRA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LAIRE—NIL NISI DIVINUM STABILE
       EST; CAETERA FUMUS—THE GONDOLA STOPPED, THE OLD
       PALACE WAS THERE, HOW CHARMING ITS GREY AND PINK—
       GOATS AND MONKEYS, WITH SUCH HAIR TOO!—SO THE
       COUNTESS PASSED ON UNTIL SHE CAME THROUGH THE
       LITTLE PARK, WHERE NIOBE PRESENTED HER WITH A
       CABINET, AND SO DEPARTED.
     BURBANK CROSSED A LITTLE BRIDGE
     DESCENDING AT A SMALL HOTEL;
     PRINCESS VOLUPINE ARRIVED,
     THEY WERE TOGETHER, AND HE FELL.

     DEFUNCTIVE MUSIC UNDER SEA
     PASSED SEAWARD WITH THE PASSING BELL
     SLOWLY: THE GOD HERCULES
     HAD LEFT HIM, THAT HAD LOVED HIM WELL.

     THE HORSES, UNDER THE AXLETREE
     BEAT UP THE DAWN FROM ISTRIA
     WITH EVEN FEET. HER SHUTTERED BARGE
     BURNED ON THE WATER ALL THE DAY.

     BUT THIS OR SUCH WAS BLEISTEIN'S WAY:
     A SAGGY BENDING OF THE KNEES
     AND ELBOWS, WITH THE PALMS TURNED OUT,
     CHICAGO SEMITE VIENNESE.

     A LUSTRELESS PROTRUSIVE EYE
     STARES FROM THE PROTOZOIC SLIME
     AT A PERSPECTIVE OF CANALETTO.
     THE SMOKY CANDLE END OF TIME

     DECLINES. ON THE RIALTO ONCE.
     THE RATS ARE UNDERNEATH THE PILES.
     THE JEW IS UNDERNEATH THE LOT.
     MONEY IN FURS. THE BOATMAN SMILES,

     PRINCESS VOLUPINE EXTENDS
     A MEAGRE, BLUE-NAILED, PHTHISIC HAND
     TO CLIMB THE WATERSTAIR. LIGHTS, LIGHTS,
     SHE ENTERTAINS SIR FERDINAND

     KLEIN. WHO CLIPPED THE LION'S WINGS
     AND FLEA'D HIS RUMP AND PARED HIS CLAWS?
     THOUGHT BURBANK, MEDITATING ON
     TIME'S RUINS, AND THE SEVEN LAWS.



SWEENEY ERECT
                           AND THE TREES ABOUT ME,
       LET THEM BE DRY AND LEAFLESS; LET THE ROCKS
       GROAN WITH CONTINUAL SURGES; AND BEHIND ME
       MAKE ALL A DESOLATION. LOOK, LOOK, WENCHES!
     PAINT ME A CAVERNOUS WASTE SHORE
     CAST IN THE UNSTILTED CYCLADES,
     PAINT ME THE BOLD ANFRACTUOUS ROCKS
     FACED BY THE SNARLED AND YELPING SEAS.

     DISPLAY ME AEOLUS ABOVE
     REVIEWING THE INSURGENT GALES
     WHICH TANGLE ARIADNE'S HAIR
     AND SWELL WITH HASTE THE PERJURED SAILS.

     MORNING STIRS THE FEET AND HANDS
     (NAUSICAA AND POLYPHEME),
     GESTURE OF ORANG-OUTANG
     RISES FROM THE SHEETS IN STEAM.

     THIS WITHERED ROOT OF KNOTS OF HAIR
     SLITTED BELOW AND GASHED WITH EYES,
     THIS OVAL O CROPPED OUT WITH TEETH:
     THE SICKLE MOTION FROM THE THIGHS

     JACKKNIFES UPWARD AT THE KNEES
     THEN STRAIGHTENS OUT FROM HEEL TO HIP
     PUSHING THE FRAMEWORK OF THE BED
     AND CLAWING AT THE PILLOW SLIP.

     SWEENEY ADDRESSED FULL LENGTH TO SHAVE
     BROADBOTTOMED, PINK FROM NAPE TO BASE,
     KNOWS THE FEMALE TEMPERAMENT
     AND WIPES THE SUDS AROUND HIS FACE.

     (THE LENGTHENED SHADOW OF A MAN
     IS HISTORY, SAID EMERSON
     WHO HAD NOT SEEN THE SILHOUETTE
     OF SWEENEY STRADDLED IN THE SUN).

     TESTS THE RAZOR ON HIS LEG
     WAITING UNTIL THE SHRIEK SUBSIDES.
     THE EPILEPTIC ON THE BED
     CURVES BACKWARD, CLUTCHING AT HER SIDES.

     THE LADIES OF THE CORRIDOR
     FIND THEMSELVES INVOLVED, DISGRACED,
     CALL WITNESS TO THEIR PRINCIPLES
     AND DEPRECATE THE LACK OF TASTE

     OBSERVING THAT HYSTERIA
     MIGHT EASILY BE MISUNDERSTOOD;
     MRS. TURNER INTIMATES
     IT DOES THE HOUSE NO SORT OF GOOD.

     BUT DORIS, TOWELLED FROM THE BATH,
     ENTERS PADDING ON BROAD FEET,
     BRINGING SAL VOLATILE
     AND A GLASS OF BRANDY NEAT.

     PIPIT SATE UPRIGHT IN HER CHAIR
       SOME DISTANCE FROM WHERE I WAS SITTING;
     VIEWS OF THE OXFORD COLLEGES
       LAY ON THE TABLE, WITH THE KNITTING.

     DAGUERREOTYPES AND SILHOUETTES,
       HER GRANDFATHER AND GREAT GREAT AUNTS,
     SUPPORTED ON THE MANTELPIECE
       AN INVITATION TO THE DANCE.

     I SHALL NOT WANT CAPITAL IN HEAVEN
       FOR I SHALL MEET SIR ALFRED MOND:
     WE TWO SHALL LIE TOGETHER, LAPT
       IN A FIVE PER CENT EXCHEQUER BOND.

     I SHALL NOT WANT SOCIETY IN HEAVEN,
       LUCRETIA BORGIA SHALL BE MY BRIDE;
     HER ANECDOTES WILL BE MORE AMUSING
       THAN PIPIT'S EXPERIENCE COULD PROVIDE.

     I SHALL NOT WANT PIPIT IN HEAVEN:
       MADAME BLAVATSKY WILL INSTRUCT ME
     IN THE SEVEN SACRED TRANCES;
       PICCARDA DE DONATI WILL CONDUCT ME.

     BUT WHERE IS THE PENNY WORLD I BOUGHT
       TO EAT WITH PIPIT BEHIND THE SCREEN?
     THE RED-EYED SCAVENGERS ARE CREEPING
       FROM KENTISH TOWN AND GOLDER'S GREEN;

     WHERE ARE THE EAGLES AND THE TRUMPETS?

THE HIPPOPOTAMUS
       SIMILITER ET OMNES REVEREANTUR DIACONOS, UT
       MANDATUM JESU CHRISTI; ET EPISCOPUM, UT JESUM
       CHRISTUM, EXISTENTEM FILIUM PATRIS; PRESBYTEROS
       AUTEM, UT CONCILIUM DEI ET CONJUNCTIONEM
       APOSTOLORUM. SINE HIS ECCLESIA NON VOCATUR; DE

       S. IGNATII AD TRALLIANOS.

       AND WHEN THIS EPISTLE IS READ AMONG YOU, CAUSE
       THAT IT BE READ ALSO IN THE CHURCH OF THE
       LAODICEANS.
     THE BROAD-BACKED HIPPOPOTAMUS
     RESTS ON HIS BELLY IN THE MUD;
     ALTHOUGH HE SEEMS SO FIRM TO US
     HE IS MERELY FLESH AND BLOOD.

     FLESH-AND-BLOOD IS WEAK AND FRAIL,
     SUSCEPTIBLE TO NERVOUS SHOCK;
     WHILE THE TRUE CHURCH CAN NEVER FAIL
     FOR IT IS BASED UPON A ROCK.

     THE HIPPO'S FEEBLE STEPS MAY ERR
     IN COMPASSING MATERIAL ENDS,
     WHILE THE TRUE CHURCH NEED NEVER STIR
     TO GATHER IN ITS DIVIDENDS.

     THE 'POTAMUS CAN NEVER REACH
     THE MANGO ON THE MANGO-TREE;
     BUT FRUITS OF POMEGRANATE AND PEACH
     REFRESH THE CHURCH FROM OVER SEA.

     AT MATING TIME THE HIPPO'S VOICE
     BETRAYS INFLEXIONS HOARSE AND ODD,
     BUT EVERY WEEK WE HEAR REJOICE
     THE CHURCH, AT BEING ONE WITH GOD.

     THE HIPPOPOTAMUS'S DAY
     IS PASSED IN SLEEP; AT NIGHT HE HUNTS;
     GOD WORKS IN A MYSTERIOUS WAY-
     THE CHURCH CAN SLEEP AND FEED AT ONCE.

     I SAW THE 'POTAMUS TAKE WING
     ASCENDING FROM THE DAMP SAVANNAS,
     AND QUIRING ANGELS ROUND HIM SING
     THE PRAISE OF GOD, IN LOUD HOSANNAS.

     BLOOD OF THE LAMB SHALL WASH HIM CLEAN
     AND HIM SHALL HEAVENLY ARMS ENFOLD,
     AMONG THE SAINTS HE SHALL BE SEEN
     PERFORMING ON A HARP OF GOLD.

     HE SHALL BE WASHED AS WHITE AS SNOW,
     BY ALL THE MARTYR'D VIRGINS KISS,
     WHILE THE TRUE CHURCH REMAINS BELOW
     WRAPT IN THE OLD MIASMAL MIST.



DANS LE RESTAURANT
     LE GARCON DÉLABRÉ QUI N'A RIEN À FAIRE

WHISPERS OF IMMORTALITY
     WEBSTER WAS MUCH POSSESSED BY DEATH
     AND SAW THE SKULL BENEATH THE SKIN;
     AND BREASTLESS CREATURES UNDER GROUND
     LEANED BACKWARD WITH A LIPLESS GRIN.

     DAFFODIL BULBS INSTEAD OF BALLS
     STARED FROM THE SOCKETS OF THE EYES!
     HE KNEW THAT THOUGHT CLINGS ROUND DEAD LIMBS
     TIGHTENING ITS LUSTS AND LUXURIES.

     DONNE, I SUPPOSE, WAS SUCH ANOTHER
     WHO FOUND NO SUBSTITUTE FOR SENSE;
     TO SEIZE AND CLUTCH AND PENETRATE,
     EXPERT BEYOND EXPERIENCE,

     HE KNEW THE ANGUISH OF THE MARROW
     THE AGUE OF THE SKELETON;
     NO CONTACT POSSIBLE TO FLESH
     ALLAYED THE FEVER OF THE BONE.
    .    .    .    .    .
     GRISHKIN IS NICE: HER RUSSIAN EYE
     IS UNDERLINED FOR EMPHASIS;
     UNCORSETED, HER FRIENDLY BUST
     GIVES PROMISE OF PNEUMATIC BLISS.

     THE COUCHED BRAZILIAN JAGUAR
     COMPELS THE SCAMPERING MARMOSET
     WITH SUBTLE EFFLUENCE OF CAT;
     GRISHKIN HAS A MAISONETTE;

     THE SLEEK BRAZILIAN JAGUAR
     DOES NOT IN ITS ARBOREAL GLOOM
     DISTIL SO RANK A FELINE SMELL
     AS GRISHKIN IN A DRAWING-ROOM.

     AND EVEN THE ABSTRACT ENTITIES
     CIRCUMAMBULATE HER CHARM;
     BUT OUR LOT CRAWLS BETWEEN DRY RIBS
     TO KEEP OUR METAPHYSICS WARM.



MR. ELIOT'S SUNDAY MORNING SERVICE
       LOOK, LOOK, MASTER, HERE COMES TWO RELIGIOUS
       CATERPILLARS.
                     THE JEW OF MALTA.
     POLYPHILOPROGENITIVE
     THE SAPIENT SUTLERS OF THE LORD
     DRIFT ACROSS THE WINDOW-PANES.
     IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD.

     IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD.
     SUPERFETATION OF [GREEK TEXT INSERTED HERE],
     AND AT THE MENSUAL TURN OF TIME
     PRODUCED ENERVATE ORIGEN.

     A PAINTER OF THE UMBRIAN SCHOOL
     DESIGNED UPON A GESSO GROUND
     THE NIMBUS OF THE BAPTIZED GOD.
     THE WILDERNESS IS CRACKED AND BROWNED

     BUT THROUGH THE WATER PALE AND THIN
     STILL SHINE THE UNOFFENDING FEET
     AND THERE ABOVE THE PAINTER SET
     THE FATHER AND THE PARACLETE.
    .    .    .    .    .
     THE SABLE PRESBYTERS APPROACH
     THE AVENUE OF PENITENCE;
     THE YOUNG ARE RED AND PUSTULAR
     CLUTCHING PIACULATIVE PENCE.

     UNDER THE PENITENTIAL GATES
     SUSTAINED BY STARING SERAPHIM
     WHERE THE SOULS OF THE DEVOUT
     BURN INVISIBLE AND DIM.

     ALONG THE GARDEN-WALL THE BEES
     WITH HAIRY BELLIES PASS BETWEEN
     THE STAMINATE AND PISTILATE,
     BLEST OFFICE OF THE EPICENE.

     SWEENEY SHIFTS FROM HAM TO HAM
     STIRRING THE WATER IN HIS BATH.
     THE MASTERS OF THE SUBTLE SCHOOLS
     ARE CONTROVERSIAL, POLYMATH.



SWEENEY AMONG THE NIGHTINGALES
       [GREEK TEXT INSERTED HERE]
     APENECK SWEENEY SPREADS HIS KNEES
     LETTING HIS ARMS HANG DOWN TO LAUGH,
     THE ZEBRA STRIPES ALONG HIS JAW
     SWELLING TO MACULATE GIRAFFE.

     THE CIRCLES OF THE STORMY MOON
     SLIDE WESTWARD TOWARD THE RIVER PLATE,
     DEATH AND THE RAVEN DRIFT ABOVE
     AND SWEENEY GUARDS THE HORNÈD GATE.

     GLOOMY ORION AND THE DOG
     ARE VEILED; AND HUSHED THE SHRUNKEN SEAS;
     THE PERSON IN THE SPANISH CAPE
     TRIES TO SIT ON SWEENEY'S KNEES

     SLIPS AND PULLS THE TABLE CLOTH
     OVERTURNS A COFFEE-CUP,
     REORGANIZED UPON THE FLOOR
     SHE YAWNS AND DRAWS A STOCKING UP;

     THE SILENT MAN IN MOCHA BROWN
     SPRAWLS AT THE WINDOW-SILL AND GAPES;
     THE WAITER BRINGS IN ORANGES
     BANANAS FIGS AND HOTHOUSE GRAPES;

     THE SILENT VERTEBRATE IN BROWN
     CONTRACTS AND CONCENTRATES, WITHDRAWS;
     RACHEL NÉE RABINOVITCH
     TEARS AT THE GRAPES WITH MURDEROUS PAWS;

     SHE AND THE LADY IN THE CAPE
     ARE SUSPECT, THOUGHT TO BE IN LEAGUE;
     THEREFORE THE MAN WITH HEAVY EYES
     DECLINES THE GAMBIT, SHOWS FATIGUE,

     LEAVES THE ROOM AND REAPPEARS
     OUTSIDE THE WINDOW, LEANING IN,
     BRANCHES OF WISTERIA
     CIRCUMSCRIBE A GOLDEN GRIN;

     THE HOST WITH SOMEONE INDISTINCT
     CONVERSES AT THE DOOR APART,
     THE NIGHTINGALES ARE SINGING NEAR
     THE CONVENT OF THE SACRED HEART,

     AND SANG WITHIN THE BLOODY WOOD
     WHEN AGAMEMNON CRIED ALOUD,
     AND LET THEIR LIQUID DROPPINGS FALL
     TO STAIN THE STIFF DISHONOURED SHROUD.



THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK
       S'IO CREDESSE CHE MIA RISPOSTA FOSSE
       A PERSONA CHE MAI TORNASSE AL MONDO,
       QUESTA FIAMMA STARIA SENZA PIU SCOSSE.
       MA PERCIOCCHE GIAMMAI DI QUESTO FONDO
       NON TORNO VIVO ALCUN, S'I'ODO IL VERO,
       SENZA TEMA D'INFAMIA TI RISPONDO.
     LET US GO THEN, YOU AND I,
     WHEN THE EVENING IS SPREAD OUT AGAINST THE SKY
     LIKE A PATIENT ETHERIZED UPON A TABLE;
     LET US GO, THROUGH CERTAIN HALF-DESERTED STREETS,
     THE MUTTERING RETREATS
     OF RESTLESS NIGHTS IN ONE-NIGHT CHEAP HOTELS
     AND SAWDUST RESTAURANTS WITH OYSTER-SHELLS:
     STREETS THAT FOLLOW LIKE A TEDIOUS ARGUMENT
     OF INSIDIOUS INTENT
     TO LEAD YOU TO AN OVERWHELMING QUESTION....
     OH, DO NOT ASK, "WHAT IS IT?"
     LET US GO AND MAKE OUR VISIT.

     IN THE ROOM THE WOMEN COME AND GO
     TALKING OF MICHELANGELO.

     THE YELLOW FOG THAT RUBS ITS BACK UPON THE WINDOW-PANES,
     THE YELLOW SMOKE THAT RUBS ITS MUZZLE ON THE WINDOW-PANES
     LICKED ITS TONGUE INTO THE CORNERS OF THE EVENING,
     LINGERED UPON THE POOLS THAT STAND IN DRAINS,
     LET FALL UPON ITS BACK THE SOOT THAT FALLS FROM CHIMNEYS,
     SLIPPED BY THE TERRACE, MADE A SUDDEN LEAP,
     AND SEEING THAT IT WAS A SOFT OCTOBER NIGHT,
     CURLED ONCE ABOUT THE HOUSE, AND FELL ASLEEP.

     AND INDEED THERE WILL BE TIME
     FOR THE YELLOW SMOKE THAT SLIDES ALONG THE STREET,
     RUBBING ITS BACK UPON THE WINDOW PANES;
     THERE WILL BE TIME, THERE WILL BE TIME
     TO PREPARE A FACE TO MEET THE FACES THAT YOU MEET
     THERE WILL BE TIME TO MURDER AND CREATE,
     AND TIME FOR ALL THE WORKS AND DAYS OF HANDS
     THAT LIFT AND DROP A QUESTION ON YOUR PLATE;
     TIME FOR YOU AND TIME FOR ME,
     AND TIME YET FOR A HUNDRED INDECISIONS,
     AND FOR A HUNDRED VISIONS AND REVISIONS,
     BEFORE THE TAKING OF A TOAST AND TEA.

     IN THE ROOM THE WOMEN COME AND GO
     TALKING OF MICHELANGELO.

     AND INDEED THERE WILL BE TIME
     TO WONDER, "DO I DARE?" AND, "DO I DARE?"
     TIME TO TURN BACK AND DESCEND THE STAIR,
     WITH A BALD SPOT IN THE MIDDLE OF MY HAIR—
     (THEY WILL SAY: "HOW HIS HAIR IS GROWING THIN!")
     MY MORNING COAT, MY COLLAR MOUNTING FIRMLY TO THE CHIN,
     MY NECKTIE RICH AND MODEST, BUT ASSERTED BY A SIMPLE PIN—
     (THEY WILL SAY: "BUT HOW HIS ARMS AND LEGS ARE THIN!")
     DO I DARE
     DISTURB THE UNIVERSE?
     IN A MINUTE THERE IS TIME
     FOR DECISIONS AND REVISIONS WHICH A MINUTE WILL REVERSE.

     FOR I HAVE KNOWN THEM ALL ALREADY, KNOWN THEM ALL:
     HAVE KNOWN THE EVENINGS, MORNINGS, AFTERNOONS,
     I HAVE MEASURED OUT MY LIFE WITH COFFEE SPOONS;
     I KNOW THE VOICES DYING WITH A DYING FALL
     BENEATH THE MUSIC FROM A FARTHER ROOM.
       SO HOW SHOULD I PRESUME?

     AND I HAVE KNOWN THE EYES ALREADY, KNOWN THEM ALL—
     THE EYES THAT FIX YOU IN A FORMULATED PHRASE,
     AND WHEN I AM FORMULATED, SPRAWLING ON A PIN,
     WHEN I AM PINNED AND WRIGGLING ON THE WALL,
     THEN HOW SHOULD I BEGIN
     TO SPIT OUT ALL THE BUTT-ENDS OF MY DAYS AND WAYS?
       AND HOW SHOULD I PRESUME?

     AND I HAVE KNOWN THE ARMS ALREADY, KNOWN THEM ALL—
     ARMS THAT ARE BRACELETED AND WHITE AND BARE
     (BUT IN THE LAMPLIGHT, DOWNED WITH LIGHT BROWN HAIR!)
     IS IT PERFUME FROM A DRESS
     THAT MAKES ME SO DIGRESS?
     ARMS THAT LIE ALONG A TABLE, OR WRAP ABOUT A SHAWL.
       AND SHOULD I THEN PRESUME?
       AND HOW SHOULD I BEGIN?
    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .
     SHALL I SAY, I HAVE GONE AT DUSK THROUGH NARROW STREETS
     AND WATCHED THE SMOKE THAT RISES FROM THE PIPES
     OF LONELY MEN IN SHIRT-SLEEVES, LEANING OUT OF WINDOWS?

     I SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PAIR OF RAGGED CLAWS
     SCUTTLING ACROSS THE FLOORS OF SILENT SEAS.
    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .

     AND THE AFTERNOON, THE EVENING, SLEEPS SO PEACEFULLY!
     SMOOTHED BY LONG FINGERS,
     ASLEEP... TIRED... OR IT MALINGERS.
     STRETCHED ON THE FLOOR, HERE BESIDE YOU AND ME.
     SHOULD I, AFTER TEA AND CAKES AND ICES,
     HAVE THE STRENGTH TO FORCE THE MOMENT TO ITS CRISIS?
     BUT THOUGH I HAVE WEPT AND FASTED, WEPT AND PRAYED,
     THOUGH I HAVE SEEN MY HEAD (GROWN SLIGHTLY BALD) BROUGHT IN UPON A PLATTER,
     I AM NO PROPHET—AND HERE'S NO GREAT MATTER;
     I HAVE SEEN THE MOMENT OF MY GREATNESS FLICKER,
     AND I HAVE SEEN THE ETERNAL FOOTMAN HOLD MY COAT, AND SNICKER,
     AND IN SHORT, I WAS AFRAID.

     AND WOULD IT HAVE BEEN WORTH IT, AFTER ALL,
     AFTER THE CUPS, THE MARMALADE, THE TEA,
     AMONG THE PORCELAIN, AMONG SOME TALK OF YOU AND ME,
     WOULD IT HAVE BEEN WORTH WHILE,
     TO HAVE BITTEN OFF THE MATTER WITH A SMILE,
     TO HAVE SQUEEZED THE UNIVERSE INTO A BALL
     TO ROLL IT TOWARD SOME OVERWHELMING QUESTION,
     TO SAY: "I AM LAZARUS, COME FROM THE DEAD,
     COME BACK TO TELL YOU ALL, I SHALL TELL YOU ALL"—
     IF ONE, SETTLING A PILLOW BY HER HEAD,
       SHOULD SAY: "THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEANT AT ALL;
       THAT IS NOT IT, AT ALL."

     AND WOULD IT HAVE BEEN WORTH IT, AFTER ALL,
     WOULD IT HAVE BEEN WORTH WHILE,
     AFTER THE SUNSETS AND THE DOORYARDS AND THE SPRINKLED STREETS,
     AFTER THE NOVELS, AFTER THE TEACUPS, AFTER THE SKIRTS THAT TRAIL ALONG THE
         FLOOR—
     AND THIS, AND SO MUCH MORE?—
     IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY JUST WHAT I MEAN!
     BUT AS IF A MAGIC LANTERN THREW THE NERVES IN PATTERNS ON A SCREEN:
     WOULD IT HAVE BEEN WORTH WHILE
     IF ONE, SETTLING A  PILLOW OR THROWING OFF A SHAWL,
     AND TURNING TOWARD THE WINDOW, SHOULD SAY:
       "THAT IS NOT IT AT ALL,
       THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEANT, AT ALL."
    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .
     NO! I AM NOT PRINCE HAMLET, NOR WAS MEANT TO BE;
     AM AN ATTENDANT LORD, ONE THAT WILL DO
     TO SWELL A PROGRESS, START A SCENE OR TWO,
     ADVISE THE PRINCE; NO DOUBT, AN EASY TOOL,
     DEFERENTIAL, GLAD TO BE OF USE,
     POLITIC, CAUTIOUS, AND METICULOUS;
     FULL OF HIGH SENTENCE, BUT A BIT OBTUSE;
     AT TIMES, INDEED, ALMOST RIDICULOUS—
     ALMOST, AT TIMES, THE FOOL.

     I GROW OLD... I GROW OLD...
     I SHALL WEAR THE BOTTOMS OF MY TROUSERS ROLLED.

     SHALL I PART MY HAIR BEHIND? DO I DARE TO EAT A PEACH?
     I SHALL WEAR WHITE FLANNEL TROUSERS, AND WALK UPON THE BEACH.
     I HAVE HEARD THE MERMAIDS SINGING, EACH TO EACH.

     I DO NOT THINK THAT THEY WILL SING TO ME.

     I HAVE SEEN THEM RIDING SEAWARD ON THE WAVES
     COMBING THE WHITE HAIR OF THE WAVES BLOWN BACK
     WHEN THE WIND BLOWS THE WATER WHITE AND BLACK.

     WE HAVE LINGERED IN THE CHAMBERS OF THE SEA
     BY SEA-GIRLS WREATHED WITH SEAWEED RED AND BROWN
     TILL HUMAN VOICES WAKE US, AND WE DROWN.



PORTRAIT OF A LADY
       THOU HAST COMMITTED—
       FORNICATION: BUT THAT WAS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY
       AND BESIDES, THE WENCH IS DEAD.
       THE JEW OF MALTA.
     I

     AMONG THE SMOKE AND FOG OF A DECEMBER AFTERNOON
     YOU HAVE THE SCENE ARRANGE ITSELF—AS IT WILL SEEM TO DO—
     WITH "I HAVE SAVED THIS AFTERNOON FOR YOU";
     AND FOUR WAX CANDLES IN THE DARKENED ROOM,
     FOUR RINGS OF LIGHT UPON THE CEILING OVERHEAD,
     AN ATMOSPHERE OF JULIET'S TOMB
     PREPARED FOR ALL THE THINGS TO BE SAID, OR LEFT UNSAID.
     WE HAVE BEEN, LET US SAY, TO HEAR THE LATEST POLE
     TRANSMIT THE PRELUDES, THROUGH HIS HAIR AND FINGER-TIPS.
     "SO INTIMATE, THIS CHOPIN, THAT I THINK HIS SOUL
     SHOULD BE RESURRECTED ONLY AMONG FRIENDS
     SOME TWO OR THREE, WHO WILL NOT TOUCH THE BLOOM
     THAT IS RUBBED AND QUESTIONED IN THE CONCERT ROOM."
     —AND SO THE CONVERSATION SLIPS
     AMONG VELLEITIES AND CAREFULLY CAUGHT REGRETS
     THROUGH ATTENUATED TONES OF VIOLINS
     MINGLED WITH REMOTE CORNETS
     AND BEGINS.

     "YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH THEY MEAN TO ME, MY FRIENDS,
     AND HOW, HOW RARE AND STRANGE IT IS, TO FIND
     IN A LIFE COMPOSED SO MUCH, SO MUCH OF ODDS AND ENDS,
     (FOR INDEED I DO NOT LOVE IT... YOU KNEW? YOU ARE NOT BLIND!
     HOW KEEN YOU ARE!)
     TO FIND A FRIEND WHO HAS THESE QUALITIES,
     WHO HAS, AND GIVES
     THOSE QUALITIES UPON WHICH FRIENDSHIP LIVES.
     HOW MUCH IT MEANS THAT I SAY THIS TO YOU—
     WITHOUT THESE FRIENDSHIPS—LIFE, WHAT CAUCHEMAR!"
     AMONG THE WINDINGS OF THE VIOLINS
     AND THE ARIETTES
     OF CRACKED CORNETS
     INSIDE MY BRAIN A DULL TOM-TOM BEGINS
     ABSURDLY HAMMERING A PRELUDE OF ITS OWN,
     CAPRICIOUS MONOTONE
     THAT IS AT LEAST ONE DEFINITE "FALSE NOTE."
     —LET US TAKE THE AIR, IN A TOBACCO TRANCE,
     ADMIRE THE MONUMENTS
     DISCUSS THE LATE EVENTS,
     CORRECT OUR WATCHES BY THE PUBLIC CLOCKS.
     THEN SIT FOR HALF AN HOUR AND DRINK OUR BOCKS.

     II

     NOW THAT LILACS ARE IN BLOOM
     SHE HAS A BOWL OF LILACS IN HER ROOM
     AND TWISTS ONE IN HER FINGERS WHILE SHE TALKS.
     "AH, MY FRIEND, YOU DO NOT KNOW, YOU DO NOT KNOW
     WHAT LIFE IS, YOU SHOULD HOLD IT IN YOUR HANDS";
     (SLOWLY TWISTING THE LILAC STALKS)
     "YOU LET IT FLOW FROM YOU, YOU LET IT FLOW,
     AND YOUTH IS CRUEL, AND HAS NO REMORSE
     AND SMILES AT SITUATIONS WHICH IT CANNOT SEE."
     I SMILE, OF COURSE,
     AND GO ON DRINKING TEA.
     "YET WITH THESE APRIL SUNSETS, THAT SOMEHOW RECALL
     MY BURIED LIFE, AND PARIS IN THE SPRING,
     I FEEL IMMEASURABLY AT PEACE, AND FIND THE WORLD
     TO BE WONDERFUL AND YOUTHFUL, AFTER ALL."

     THE VOICE RETURNS LIKE THE INSISTENT OUT-OF-TUNE
     OF A BROKEN VIOLIN ON AN AUGUST AFTERNOON:
     "I AM ALWAYS SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND
     MY FEELINGS, ALWAYS SURE THAT YOU FEEL,
     SURE THAT ACROSS THE GULF YOU REACH YOUR HAND.

     YOU ARE INVULNERABLE, YOU HAVE NO ACHILLES' HEEL.
     YOU WILL GO ON, AND WHEN YOU HAVE PREVAILED
     YOU CAN SAY: AT THIS POINT MANY A ONE HAS FAILED.

     BUT WHAT HAVE I, BUT WHAT HAVE I, MY FRIEND,
     TO GIVE YOU, WHAT CAN YOU RECEIVE FROM ME?
     ONLY THE FRIENDSHIP AND THE SYMPATHY
     OF ONE ABOUT TO REACH HER JOURNEY'S END.

     I SHALL SIT HERE, SERVING TEA TO FRIENDS...."

     I TAKE MY HAT: HOW CAN I MAKE A COWARDLY AMENDS
     FOR WHAT SHE HAS SAID TO ME?
     YOU WILL SEE ME ANY MORNING IN THE PARK
     READING THE COMICS AND THE SPORTING PAGE.
     PARTICULARLY I REMARK AN ENGLISH COUNTESS GOES UPON THE STAGE.
     A GREEK WAS MURDERED AT A POLISH DANCE,
     ANOTHER BANK DEFAULTER HAS CONFESSED.
     I KEEP MY COUNTENANCE, I REMAIN SELF-POSSESSED
     EXCEPT WHEN A STREET PIANO, MECHANICAL AND TIRED
     REITERATES SOME WORN-OUT COMMON SONG
     WITH THE SMELL OF HYACINTHS ACROSS THE GARDEN
     RECALLING THINGS THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DESIRED.
     ARE THESE IDEAS RIGHT OR WRONG?

     III

     THE OCTOBER NIGHT COMES DOWN; RETURNING AS BEFORE
     EXCEPT FOR A SLIGHT SENSATION OF BEING ILL AT EASE
     I MOUNT THE STAIRS AND TURN THE HANDLE OF THE DOOR
     AND FEEL AS IF I HAD MOUNTED ON MY HANDS AND KNEES.

     "AND SO YOU ARE GOING ABROAD; AND WHEN DO YOU RETURN?
     BUT THAT'S A USELESS QUESTION.
     YOU HARDLY KNOW WHEN YOU ARE COMING BACK,
     YOU WILL FIND SO MUCH TO LEARN."
     MY SMILE FALLS HEAVILY AMONG THE BRIC-À-BRAC.

     "PERHAPS YOU CAN WRITE TO ME."
     MY SELF-POSSESSION FLARES UP FOR A SECOND;
     THIS IS AS I HAD RECKONED.

     "I HAVE BEEN WONDERING FREQUENTLY OF LATE
     (BUT OUR BEGINNINGS NEVER KNOW OUR ENDS!)
     WHY WE HAVE NOT DEVELOPED INTO FRIENDS."
     I FEEL LIKE ONE WHO SMILES, AND TURNING SHALL REMARK
     SUDDENLY, HIS EXPRESSION IN A GLASS.
     MY SELF-POSSESSION GUTTERS; WE ARE REALLY IN THE DARK.

     "FOR EVERYBODY SAID SO, ALL OUR FRIENDS,
     THEY ALL WERE SURE OUR FEELINGS WOULD RELATE
     SO CLOSELY! I MYSELF CAN HARDLY UNDERSTAND.
     WE MUST LEAVE IT NOW TO FATE.
     YOU WILL WRITE, AT ANY RATE.
     PERHAPS IT IS NOT TOO LATE.
     I SHALL SIT HERE, SERVING TEA TO FRIENDS."

     AND I MUST BORROW EVERY CHANGING SHAPE
     TO FIND EXPRESSION... DANCE, DANCE
     LIKE A DANCING BEAR,
     CRY LIKE A PARROT, CHATTER LIKE AN APE.
     LET US TAKE THE AIR, IN A TOBACCO TRANCE—
     WELL! AND WHAT IF SHE SHOULD DIE SOME AFTERNOON,
     AFTERNOON GREY AND SMOKY, EVENING YELLOW AND ROSE;
     SHOULD DIE AND LEAVE ME SITTING PEN IN HAND
     WITH THE SMOKE COMING DOWN ABOVE THE HOUSETOPS;
     DOUBTFUL, FOR QUITE A WHILE
     NOT KNOWING WHAT TO FEEL OR IF I UNDERSTAND
     OR WHETHER WISE OR FOOLISH, TARDY OR TOO SOON...
     WOULD SHE NOT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE, AFTER ALL?
     THIS MUSIC IS SUCCESSFUL WITH A "DYING FALL"
     NOW THAT WE TALK OF DYING—
     AND SHOULD I HAVE THE RIGHT TO SMILE?



PRELUDES
     I

     THE WINTER EVENING SETTLES DOWN
     WITH SMELL OF STEAKS IN PASSAGEWAYS.
     SIX O'CLOCK.
     THE BURNT-OUT ENDS OF SMOKY DAYS.
     AND NOW A GUSTY SHOWER WRAPS
     THE GRIMY SCRAPS
     OF WITHERED LEAVES ABOUT YOUR FEET
     AND NEWSPAPERS FROM VACANT LOTS;
     THE SHOWERS BEAT
     ON BROKEN BLINDS AND CHIMNEY-POTS,
     AND AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET
     A LONELY CAB-HORSE STEAMS AND STAMPS.
     AND THEN THE LIGHTING OF THE LAMPS.

     II

     THE MORNING COMES TO CONSCIOUSNESS
     OF FAINT STALE SMELLS OF BEER
     FROM THE SAWDUST-TRAMPLED STREET
     WITH ALL ITS MUDDY FEET THAT PRESS
     TO EARLY COFFEE-STANDS.

     WITH THE OTHER MASQUERADES
     THAT TIME RESUMES,
     ONE THINKS OF ALL THE HANDS
     THAT ARE RAISING DINGY SHADES
     IN A THOUSAND FURNISHED ROOMS.

     III

     YOU TOSSED A BLANKET FROM THE BED,
     YOU LAY UPON YOUR BACK, AND WAITED;
     YOU DOZED, AND WATCHED THE NIGHT REVEALING
     THE THOUSAND SORDID IMAGES
     OF WHICH YOUR SOUL WAS CONSTITUTED;
     THEY FLICKERED AGAINST THE CEILING.
     AND WHEN ALL THE WORLD CAME BACK
     AND THE LIGHT CREPT UP BETWEEN THE SHUTTERS,
     AND YOU HEARD THE SPARROWS IN THE GUTTERS,
     YOU HAD SUCH A VISION OF THE STREET
     AS THE STREET HARDLY UNDERSTANDS;
     SITTING ALONG THE BED'S EDGE, WHERE
     YOU CURLED THE PAPERS FROM YOUR HAIR,
     OR CLASPED THE YELLOW SOLES OF FEET
     IN THE PALMS OF BOTH SOILED HANDS.

     IV

     HIS SOUL STRETCHED TIGHT ACROSS THE SKIES
     THAT FADE BEHIND A CITY BLOCK,
     OR TRAMPLED BY INSISTENT FEET
     AT FOUR AND FIVE AND SIX O'CLOCK;
     AND SHORT SQUARE FINGERS STUFFING PIPES,
     AND EVENING NEWSPAPERS, AND EYES
     ASSURED OF CERTAIN CERTAINTIES,
     THE CONSCIENCE OF A BLACKENED STREET
     IMPATIENT TO ASSUME THE WORLD.

     I AM MOVED BY FANCIES THAT ARE CURLED
     AROUND THESE IMAGES, AND CLING:
     THE NOTION OF SOME INFINITELY GENTLE
     INFINITELY SUFFERING THING.

     WIPE YOUR HAND ACROSS YOUR MOUTH, AND LAUGH;
     THE WORLDS REVOLVE LIKE ANCIENT WOMEN
     GATHERING FUEL IN VACANT LOTS.



RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT
     TWELVE O'CLOCK.
     ALONG THE REACHES OF THE STREET
     HELD IN A LUNAR SYNTHESIS,
     WHISPERING LUNAR INCANTATIONS
     DISOLVE THE FLOORS OF MEMORY
     AND ALL ITS CLEAR RELATIONS,
     ITS DIVISIONS AND PRECISIONS,
     EVERY STREET LAMP THAT I PASS
     BEATS LIKE A FATALISTIC DRUM,
     AND THROUGH THE SPACES OF THE DARK
     MIDNIGHT SHAKES THE MEMORY
     AS A MADMAN SHAKES A DEAD GERANIUM.

     HALF-PAST ONE,
     THE STREET LAMP SPUTTERED,
     THE STREET LAMP MUTTERED,
     THE STREET LAMP SAID,
     "REGARD THAT WOMAN
     WHO HESITATES TOWARD YOU IN THE LIGHT OF THE DOOR
     WHICH OPENS ON HER LIKE A GRIN.
     YOU SEE THE BORDER OF HER DRESS
     IS TORN AND STAINED WITH SAND,
     AND YOU SEE THE CORNER OF HER EYE
     TWISTS LIKE A CROOKED PIN."

     THE MEMORY THROWS UP HIGH AND DRY
     A CROWD OF TWISTED THINGS;
     A TWISTED BRANCH UPON THE BEACH
     EATEN SMOOTH, AND POLISHED
     AS IF THE WORLD GAVE UP
     THE SECRET OF ITS SKELETON,
     STIFF AND WHITE.
     A BROKEN SPRING IN A FACTORY YARD,
     RUST THAT CLINGS TO THE FORM THAT THE STRENGTH HAS LEFT
     HARD AND CURLED AND READY TO SNAP.

     HALF-PAST TWO,
     THE STREET-LAMP SAID,
     "REMARK THE CAT WHICH FLATTENS ITSELF IN THE GUTTER,
     SLIPS OUT ITS TONGUE
     AND DEVOURS A MORSEL OF RANCID BUTTER."
     SO THE HAND OF THE CHILD, AUTOMATIC,
     SLIPPED OUT AND POCKETED A TOY THAT WAS RUNNING ALONG
     THE QUAY.
     I COULD SEE NOTHING BEHIND THAT CHILD'S EYE.
     I HAVE SEEN EYES IN THE STREET
     TRYING TO PEER THROUGH LIGHTED SHUTTERS,
     AND A CRAB ONE AFTERNOON IN A POOL,
     AN OLD CRAB WITH BARNACLES ON HIS BACK,
     GRIPPED THE END OF A STICK WHICH I HELD HIM.

     HALF-PAST THREE,
     THE LAMP SPUTTERED,
     THE LAMP MUTTERED IN THE DARK.

     THE LAMP HUMMED:
     "REGARD THE MOON,
     LA LUNE NE GARDE AUCUNE RANCUNE,
     SHE WINKS A FEEBLE EYE,
     SHE SMILES INTO CORNERS.
     SHE SMOOTHS THE HAIR OF THE GRASS.
     THE MOON HAS LOST HER MEMORY.
     A WASHED-OUT SMALLPOX CRACKS HER FACE,
     HER HAND TWISTS A PAPER ROSE,
     THAT SMELLS OF DUST AND OLD COLOGNE,
     SHE IS ALONE WITH ALL THE OLD NOCTURNAL SMELLS
     THAT CROSS AND CROSS ACROSS HER BRAIN.
     THE REMINISCENCE COMES
     OF SUNLESS DRY GERANIUMS
     AND DUST IN CREVICES,
     SMELLS OF CHESTNUTS IN THE STREETS
     AND FEMALE SMELLS IN SHUTTERED ROOMS
     AND CIGARETTES IN CORRIDORS
     AND COCKTAIL SMELLS IN BARS."

     THE LAMP SAID,
     "FOUR O'CLOCK,
     HERE IS THE NUMBER ON THE DOOR.
     MEMORY!
     YOU HAVE THE KEY,
     THE LITTLE LAMP SPREADS A RING ON THE STAIR,
     MOUNT.
     THE BED IS OPEN; THE TOOTH-BRUSH HANGS ON THE WALL,
     PUT YOUR SHOES AT THE DOOR, SLEEP, PREPARE FOR LIFE."

     THE LAST TWIST OF THE KNIFE.



MORNING AT THE WINDOW
     THEY ARE RATTLING BREAKFAST PLATES IN BASEMENT KITCHENS,
     AND ALONG THE TRAMPLED EDGES OF THE STREET
     I AM AWARE OF THE DAMP SOULS OF HOUSEMAIDS
     SPROUTING DESPONDENTLY AT AREA GATES.
     THE BROWN WAVES OF FOG TOSS UP TO ME
     TWISTED FACES FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE STREET,
     AND TEAR FROM A PASSER-BY WITH MUDDY SKIRTS
     AN AIMLESS SMILE THAT HOVERS IN THE AIR
     AND VANISHES ALONG THE LEVEL OF THE ROOFS.



THE BOSTON EVENING TRANSCRIPT
     THE READERS OF THE BOSTON EVENING TRANSCRIPT
     SWAY IN THE WIND LIKE A FIELD OF RIPE CORN.
     WHEN EVENING QUICKENS FAINTLY IN THE STREET,
     WAKENING THE APPETITES OF LIFE IN SOME
     AND TO OTHERS BRINGING THE BOSTON EVENING TRANSCRIPT,
     I MOUNT THE STEPS AND RING THE BELL, TURNING
     WEARILY, AS ONE WOULD TURN TO NOD GOOD-BYE TO ROCHEFOUCAULD,
     IF THE STREET WERE TIME AND HE AT THE END OF THE STREET,
     AND I SAY, "COUSIN HARRIET, HERE IS THE BOSTON EVENING TRANSCRIPT."



AUNT HELEN
     MISS HELEN SLINGSBY WAS MY MAIDEN AUNT,
     AND LIVED IN A SMALL HOUSE NEAR A FASHIONABLE SQUARE
     CARED FOR BY SERVANTS TO THE NUMBER OF FOUR.
     NOW WHEN SHE DIED THERE WAS SILENCE IN HEAVEN
     AND SILENCE AT HER END OF THE STREET.
     THE SHUTTERS WERE DRAWN AND THE UNDERTAKER WIPED HIS FEET—
     HE WAS AWARE THAT THIS SORT OF THING HAD OCCURRED BEFORE.
     THE DOGS WERE HANDSOMELY PROVIDED FOR,
     BUT SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THE PARROT DIED TOO.
     THE DRESDEN CLOCK CONTINUED TICKING ON THE MANTELPIECE,
     AND THE FOOTMAN SAT UPON THE DINING-TABLE
     HOLDING THE SECOND HOUSEMAID ON HIS KNEES—
     WHO HAD ALWAYS BEEN SO CAREFUL WHILE HER MISTRESS LIVED.



COUSIN NANCY
     MISS NANCY ELLICOTT STRODE ACROSS THE HILLS AND BROKE THEM,
     RODE ACROSS THE HILLS AND BROKE THEM—
     THE BARREN NEW ENGLAND HILLS—
     RIDING TO HOUNDS
     OVER THE COW-PASTURE.

     MISS NANCY ELLICOTT SMOKED
     AND DANCED ALL THE MODERN DANCES;
     AND HER AUNTS WERE NOT QUITE SURE HOW THEY FELT ABOUT IT,
     BUT THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS MODERN.

     UPON THE GLAZEN SHELVES KEPT WATCH
     MATTHEW AND WALDO, GUARDIANS OF THE FAITH,
     THE ARMY OF UNALTERABLE LAW.



MR. APOLLINAX
     WHEN MR. APOLLINAX VISITED THE UNITED STATES
     HIS LAUGHTER TINKLED AMONG THE TEACUPS.
     I THOUGHT OF FRAGILION, THAT SHY FIGURE AMONG THE BIRCH-TREES,
     AND OF PRIAPUS IN THE SHRUBBERY
     GAPING AT THE LADY IN THE SWING.
     IN THE PALACE OF MRS. PHLACCUS, AT PROFESSOR CHANNING-CHEETAH'S
     HE LAUGHED LIKE AN IRRESPONSIBLE FOETUS.
     HIS LAUGHTER WAS SUBMARINE AND PROFOUND
     LIKE THE OLD MAN OF THE SEA'S
     HIDDEN UNDER CORAL ISLANDS
     WHERE WORRIED BODIES OF DROWNED MEN DRIFT DOWN IN THE GREEN SILENCE,
     DROPPING FROM FINGERS OF SURF.
     I LOOKED FOR THE HEAD OF MR. APOLLINAX ROLLING UNDER A CHAIR
     OR GRINNING OVER A SCREEN
     WITH SEAWEED IN ITS HAIR.
     I HEARD THE BEAT OF CENTAUR'S HOOFS OVER THE HARD TURF
     AS HIS DRY AND PASSIONATE TALK DEVOURED THE AFTERNOON.
     "HE IS A CHARMING MAN"—"BUT AFTER ALL WHAT DID HE MEAN?"—
     "HIS POINTED EARS... HE MUST BE UNBALANCED,"—
     "THERE WAS SOMETHING HE SAID THAT I MIGHT HAVE CHALLENGED."
     OF DOWAGER MRS. PHLACCUS, AND PROFESSOR AND MRS. CHEETAH
     I REMEMBER A SLICE OF LEMON, AND A BITTEN MACAROON.



HYSTERIA
     AS SHE LAUGHED I WAS AWARE OF BECOMING INVOLVED IN HER
     LAUGHTER AND BEING PART OF IT, UNTIL HER TEETH WERE
     ONLY ACCIDENTAL STARS WITH A TALENT FOR SQUAD-DRILL. I
     WAS DRAWN IN BY SHORT GASPS, INHALED AT EACH MOMENTARY
     RECOVERY, LOST FINALLY IN THE DARK CAVERNS OF HER
     THROAT, BRUISED BY THE RIPPLE OF UNSEEN MUSCLES. AN
     ELDERLY WAITER WITH TREMBLING HANDS WAS HURRIEDLY
     SPREADING A PINK AND WHITE CHECKED CLOTH OVER THE RUSTY
     GREEN IRON TABLE, SAYING: "IF THE LADY AND GENTLEMAN
     WISH TO TAKE THEIR TEA IN THE GARDEN, IF THE LADY AND
     GENTLEMAN WISH TO TAKE THEIR TEA IN THE GARDEN..." I
     DECIDED THAT IF THE SHAKING OF HER BREASTS COULD BE
     STOPPED, SOME OF THE FRAGMENTS OF THE AFTERNOON MIGHT
     BE COLLECTED, AND I CONCENTRATED MY ATTENTION WITH
     CAREFUL SUBTLETY TO THIS END.



CONVERSATION GALANTE
     I OBSERVE: "OUR SENTIMENTAL FRIEND THE MOON!
     OR POSSIBLY (FANTASTIC, I CONFESS)
     IT MAY BE PRESTER JOHN'S BALLOON
     OR AN OLD BATTERED LANTERN HUNG ALOFT
     TO LIGHT POOR TRAVELLERS TO THEIR DISTRESS."
       SHE THEN: "HOW YOU DIGRESS!"

     AND I THEN: "SOME ONE FRAMES UPON THE KEYS
     THAT EXQUISITE NOCTURNE, WITH WHICH WE EXPLAIN
     THE NIGHT AND MOONSHINE; MUSIC WHICH WE SEIZE
     TO BODY FORTH OUR VACUITY."
       SHE THEN: "DOES THIS REFER TO ME?"
       "OH NO, IT IS I WHO AM INANE."

     "YOU, MADAM, ARE THE ETERNAL HUMORIST,
     THE ETERNAL ENEMY OF THE ABSOLUTE,
     GIVING OUR VAGRANT MOODS THE SLIGHTEST TWIST!
     WITH YOUR AIR INDIFFERENT AND IMPERIOUS
     AT A STROKE OUR MAD POETICS TO CONFUTE—"
       AND—"ARE WE THEN SO SERIOUS?"



LA FIGLIA CHE PIANGE
       O QUAM TE MEMOREM VIRGO...
     STAND ON THE HIGHEST PAVEMENT OF THE STAIR—
     LEAN ON A GARDEN URN—
     WEAVE, WEAVE THE SUNLIGHT IN YOUR HAIR—
     CLASP YOUR FLOWERS TO YOU WITH A PAINED SURPRISE—
     FLING THEM TO THE GROUND AND TURN
     WITH A FUGITIVE RESENTMENT IN YOUR EYES:
     BUT WEAVE, WEAVE THE SUNLIGHT IN YOUR HAIR.

     SO I WOULD HAVE HAD HIM LEAVE,
     SO I WOULD HAVE HAD HER STAND AND GRIEVE,
     SO HE WOULD HAVE LEFT
     AS THE SOUL LEAVES THE BODY TORN AND BRUISED,
     AS THE MIND DESERTS THE BODY IT HAS USED.
     I SHOULD FIND
     SOME WAY INCOMPARABLY LIGHT AND DEFT,
     SOME WAY WE BOTH SHOULD UNDERSTAND,
     SIMPLE AND FAITHLESS AS A SMILE AND SHAKE OF THE HAND.

     SHE TURNED AWAY, BUT WITH THE AUTUMN WEATHER
     COMPELLED MY IMAGINATION MANY DAYS,
     MANY DAYS AND MANY HOURS:
     HER HAIR OVER HER ARMS AND HER ARMS FULL OF FLOWERS.
     AND I WONDER HOW THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOGETHER!
     I SHOULD HAVE LOST A GESTURE AND A POSE.
     SOMETIMES THESE COGITATIONS STILL AMAZE
     THE TROUBLED MIDNIGHT AND THE NOON'S REPOSE.
